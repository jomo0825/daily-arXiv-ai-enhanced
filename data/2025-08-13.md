<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高作物产量和减少经济损失需要更精准高效的植物病害和虫害检测方法。

Method: 评估现代AI、机器学习和深度学习技术，并将方法分为五类：高光谱成像、非可视化技术、可视化方法、改进的深度学习架构及Transformer模型。

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出ImageDDI框架，通过结合分子功能基序和分子全局图像信息的方式，提高药物相互作用(DDI)预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物相互作用多由功能基序间的相互作用引发，但现有方法在基于功能基序的表示学习上存在局限性，难以准确预测药物间的交互。

Method: 提出ImageDDI框架，结合分子功能基序信息和全局分子图像信息，并使用Transformer编码器和自适应特征融合方法增强表示能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，ImageDDI在多个常用数据集上均优于当前最先进方法，并在2D与3D增强场景下性能优越。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过创新的多模态数据表示方式，有效提高DDI预测性能，为药物安全性研究提供可靠工具。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

### [3] [Designing Object Detection Models for TinyML: Foundations, Comparative Analysis, Challenges, and Emerging Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08352)
*Christophe EL Zeinaty,Wassim Hamidouche,Glenn Herrou,Daniel Menard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文为在资源有限的物联网设备上部署目标检测模型的优化挑战提供了详细分析，并总结了一些关键优化技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备数量迅猛增加，需要在超低功耗的设备上实现高效实时的目标检测，但通常资源受限的物联网微控制器无法承受深度学习目标检测模型的计算负担。

Method: 通过综述文章，对量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏、神经结构搜索等关键优化技术进行详尽的分析，并比较现有方法在目标检测预测准确性与效率上的指标。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种任务和硬件无关的混合光学神经网络（ONNs）管道，提升系统性能并解决准确性缺陷和硬件误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合光学神经网络在训练和硬件模拟与实现之间的准确性差距问题，同时扩展其在不同任务和硬件系统中的适应性。

Method: 利用任务和硬件无关的设计，提出了可以支持多种任务（分类、分割）的模型，并加入神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD）方法，实现与电子教师网络的对齐，提升训练前后以及硬件误差后的模型表现。

Result: 在多个数据集（MNIST、CIFAR、Carvana Masking）和多种硬件配置的实验中，展示了该管道显著提升光学神经网络的性能，使其适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了光学神经网络训练与硬件差异所导致的问题，具备通用性和广泛适用性，对光学系统设计和训练具有指导意义。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS 是一个通过多专长代理协作生成长序列视频故事的框架，并通过独特的模块化方法实现了优质的视频生成与扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列视频生成在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力方面的不足。

Method: 提出 MAViS 框架，包括从脚本创作到视频生成的多阶段多代理协作，使用 3E 原则（探索、审查、增强），并引入脚本编写指南提高生成兼容性。

Result: 实验表明 MAViS 在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力方面达到了最新水平。其框架支持与多种生成模型的扩展。

Conclusion: MAViS 实现了高质量的长序列视频生成，集成叙事和背景音乐，激发用户创意，是独具特色的多模态设计输出框架。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON 是一款多服装试穿框架，通过三大模块实现高质量人物和服装合成，超越现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法无法有效同时处理上下服装，且难以保留人物特征，影响逼真度和灵活性。

Method: 提出一个联合上下服装与个体特征的多服装扩散系统，包含服装表达模块、人物表达模块和融合模块基于扩散变压器的合成技术。

Result: 实验表明该方法在 VITON-HD 和 DressCode 基准上取得了高分，生成具有高保真度和身份保持特性的图像。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON 拥有更高的定制化能力和逼真性，适用于真实世界的虚拟试穿应用场景。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的场景表示方法，通过使用名为Concurrent Object Layers (CObL)的扩散架构，生成多层次的对象分层，能够同时处理多个遮挡对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改进视觉系统在理解空间关系和遮挡对象时的表现，作者希望开发一种可以在图像中发现和分离多个对象的更通用的模型。

Method: 提出了CObL，一种基于扩散的架构，通过并行生成对象层和利用Stable Diffusion作为自然对象的先验来实现。同时在推断时添加指导，确保分层的结果可以还原为原始输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成的多对象桌面场景数据上训练，并展示了对真实世界桌面照片的新对象的零样本泛化能力，无需用户提示也无需事先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL克服了现有无监督对象表示学习模型的局限性，能够完成多对象遮挡区域的重建，适用范围广泛，具有潜在的现实应用价值。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型在处理视觉叙事时表现出从表层认知到深层叙事推理的显著差距。本研究通过漫画叙事理解揭示了这一问题，并提出了一种新的评价框架来系统衡量这些局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的大型多模态模型在个体画面理解上表现优异，但在时间因果性和跨画面叙事连贯性等方面表现不足，因此有必要揭示和改善这一问题。

Method: 研究提出了一个新的评价框架，结合了精细的多模态注释、跨模态嵌入分析和基于检索的评估方法，用于分析模型在情节推理中的不足。

Result: 通过对《Re:Zero》漫画的长篇故事理解进行研究，发现现有模型在处理非线性叙事、角色一致性以及跨长序列的因果推理上表现较差，缺乏真正的叙事智能。

Conclusion: 本研究为评估叙事智能建立了基础和实用方法，同时为多模态模型在超越基础识别的深度视觉叙事理解能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章介绍了VISOR方法，通过优化可视输入实现对多模态模型的行为控制，具备高效性和隐蔽性，但暴露了基于视觉输入攻击的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效、隐蔽地对视觉语言模型进行行为控制，且对API服务和闭源部署的支持不佳。

Method: 提出一种基于优化视觉输入的行为控制方法VISOR，通过生成通用引导图像来激发目标激活模式，从而实现模型输出行为的引导和重定向。

Result: VISOR在多个行为调整任务中表现优异，获得的行为正向调整与基线相近或超过激活向量，对负向控制的提升可达25%，且在14000项无关任务中保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅重塑了多模态模型的控制方式，还暴露了视觉输入的安全隐患，表明需紧急开发应对视觉操控攻击的防御机制。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过使用现代日语字体的平行文本图像来扩充近代文献OCR系统的训练数据，并通过引入基于距离的目标函数来提高识别性能，最终有效减少字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决近代文献OCR训练数据有限的问题，通过扩充数据提高识别能力，支持历史研究。

Method: 利用近代日语文本与现代日语字体的平行图像，设计基于距离的目标函数（采用欧几里得距离与最大均值差距），以减少自注意力特征间的差距进行域适配。

Result: 实验表明，与基于Transformer的OCR基线相比，使用欧几里得距离和最大均值差距分别将字符错误率降低了2.23%和3.94%。

Conclusion: 本方法不仅减少了字符错误率，还提升了自注意力表示的区分质量，从而提高了历史文献OCR性能。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CalAttn模块，能自适应每个实例进行温度标定从而显著降低Visual Transformers（ViTs）的校准误差，减少了对全局标定温度的依赖，且性能稳定高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉变换器（ViTs）应用于风险敏感任务时，概率校准变得极其重要。现有解决方案如后处理温度标定依赖全局标定参数且需要单独的验证数据集，存在一定局限性。

Method: 提出了一种可插拔模块（CalAttn），通过ViT的CLS token自适应学习每个实例的温度参数，替代传统的固定全局标定温度方案。

Result: 实验表明，CalAttn在CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K等多数据集上能将校准误差降低至4倍，同时引入的额外参数少于0.1%。

Conclusion: CalAttn方法简单高效，无架构依赖性，增强了模型概率的可信性而不降低准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DTLP-Net框架，通过两个多样化的教师模型和标签传播，有效生成伪标签，提高了泛化能力，在五个数据集上均超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决医疗图像分割中有限标注和领域迁移问题，开发一个能适应多任务的通用框架。

Method: 采用单个学生模型与两个多样化教师模型，结合标签传播与数据增强策略，提高伪标签质量和模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在SSMIS、UMDA和Semi-MDG任务上的五个基准数据集测试中，模型性能显著优于当前最新方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架通过可靠伪标签生成和多样性增强，展示了处理复杂半监督学习场景的潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FLIPNET网络，用于解决盲脸修复中的HQ-LQ图像差异及合成与真实图片的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对目前扩散模型在盲脸修复任务中效果有限的问题，重点解决高低质量图像和合成与真实图像之间的差异。

Method: 提出了包含修复模式和降质模式的统一网络FLIPNET。其中修复模式从LQ图片中逐步融合BFR特征，降质模式则根据真实降质数据生成接近真实的低质图像。

Result: 模型在基准数据集上的评估显示，在真实性和保真性上超过了现有扩散模型，同时在模拟真实降质效果上优于传统降质方法。

Conclusion: FLIPNET通过改善扩散模型在盲脸修复中的表现，解决了枝术中的两个主要差距问题，提升了真实性和保真性。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过创新设计和结合视觉基础模型，成功实现临床指南一致的左心室指标测量。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出利用类别标签中的语义结构（特别是超级类信息）来减少对虚假特征的依赖，并通过实验验证了其在域泛化任务中的显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作中对抗虚假相关性的研究通常依赖于分组或虚假特征的辅助标注，且假设源域和目标域的分组集合相同。然而，这些假设在现实中并不实用。

Method: 该方法利用类别标签中的语义结构，特别是超级类信息，通过预训练视觉语言模型的梯度注意力拆分出超级类相关和无关的特征，并提升对所有超级类相关特征的利用来预测。

Result: 实验表明，在多个数据集的域泛化任务中，该方法明显优于基线方法，在定量指标和定性可视化中均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在不需要对源样本进行标注的情况下，能够实现对更复杂虚假相关性的鲁棒性，应对实际问题更具实用性。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成方法难以实现对人物、背景、轨迹和动作模式的独立控制，影响生成视频的灵活性与质量。

Method: 构建基于地面的3D坐标系统，在3D空间中编辑运动轨迹；使用现代文本到视频扩散模型，通过添加运动控制信号实现高质量视频生成。

Result: 通过实验验证，方法在元素逐一控制能力及整体视频质量上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 新方法实现了个性化、细粒度控制的人物视频生成，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Motivation: 现有大模型的文档理解能力强，但推理过程缺乏透明度，尤其在法律、金融、医疗等高风险领域存在问题，且固定的CoT推理方法在领域任务间的泛化能力不佳。

Method: 提出DocThinker，基于规则的强化学习框架，通过策略学习在推理过程中动态生成解释，结合多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化，减少灾难性遗忘并提升适应性与透明度。

Result: DocThinker在多项基准测试中显著提高了模型的泛化能力和推理过程的可解释性，同时生成了更易理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习的方式改进推理过程的透明度和适应性，为多模态语言模型的文档理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有的HOI检测方法中，基于DETR的主流框架受制于随机初始化查询缺乏明确语义的问题，导致检测性能不佳。

Method: 提出了QueryCraft框架，其中核心组件ACTOR用于跨模态Transformer的语义学习，以及PDQD模块用预训练检测器增强对象查询质量。结合语义引导的注意力机制，提供更清晰和有效的查询表示。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准上进行了大量实验，表明该方法达到了最先进的性能和较强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过双分支查询初始化策略，提高了HOI检测的性能和查询的可解释性。代码将在发表时公开。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TransMiter的轻量级适配器模型，它能够在不需要反向传播的情况下高效增强视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VLMs变得日益复杂，微调这些模型的成本也不断上升。有必要利用较弱模型的适配知识来高效增强较强模型的能力。然而，现有方法存在局限性，无法跨模型高效迁移适配能力，同时计算开销较大。

Method: 提出了TransMiter，一个无需反向传播的轻量级适配器，通过捕捉预训练和微调之间的知识差异实现模型能力的提升。其具有模型无关性及低计算开销。此外，结合少量带标签数据进一步增强性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，TransMiter能够在视觉识别任务中高效地进行适配知识迁移，同时保持不同架构和规模的VLMs的一般化能力。

Conclusion: TransMiter有效平衡了性能增强与计算成本，展示出卓越的模型迁移能力，是提升VLMs效率的有力工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 此方法通过引入自监督学习和相关策略，不仅提升了手持视频去模糊的效果，还公开了方法及数据集供社区使用，为今后的研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: 结合神经艺术风格与颜色转移的方法在艺术表现增强和图像修正领域具有潜在应用价值，KL散度提供了有效的评价手段。

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Conclusion: HVPL模型通过帧级和视频级双重措施，显著缓解了视频实例分割中的类别遗忘问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Motivation: 知识蒸馏在大规模视觉语言模型中重新受到关注。当前的方法需要大量特定任务数据，这在实际场景中难以实现，本文为解决不确定性和跨模态特征表示的问题而提出AME方法。

Method: 通过一对投影函数将图像和文本映射到共享流形上，在该流形上执行熵最小化，以对跨模态特征表示进行结构性压缩，在不改变主干结构的情况下实现鲁棒知识蒸馏。

Result: 理论表明将知识蒸馏与共享流形上的熵最小化结合，能够降低泛化误差界。实验结果显示，AME在多种蒸馏框架和训练设置下提升了下游任务的泛化性能。

Conclusion: AME实现了在低数据条件下对视觉语言模型的鲁棒泛化，并对现有知识蒸馏框架具有良好的兼容性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 新框架统一了两种不同场景，达到了现有方法难以企及的一致性和可解释性，具备实际应用前景。

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Conclusion: HiWL方法成功实现了隐蔽性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PADReg，一种基于物理的超声变形配准方法，利用接触力作为先验信息来提高配准精度和解剖对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因超声图像对比度低、噪声大且组织边界模糊所导致的配准效果差的问题，尤其在大变形情况下的限制。

Method: 采用接触力与超声图像的多模态信息构建像素级刚度图，然后结合力数据通过基于胡克定律的物理模型估算变形场。

Result: 在体内数据集的实验表明，HD95达到12.90，比最先进的方法提高了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入对接触力的物理约束，比仅依赖图像相似性的传统方法在解剖对齐上有显著改进，并公开了源码以促进研究。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

### [29] [ROD: RGB-Only Fast and Efficient Off-road Freespace Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08697)
*Tong Sun,Hongliang Ye,Jilin Mei,Liang Chen,Fangzhou Zhao,Leiqiang Zong,Yu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的仅基于RGB的离线路径检测方法，旨在取代当前需要多模态融合（RGB和LiDAR）的复杂计算方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的离线路径检测方法通常需要融合RGB图像和LiDAR数据，但这种方法计算量较大，尤其在实时应用中，推断速度较低。为了提高实时性，需要设计无需依赖LiDAR的解决方案。

Method: 论文利用预训练的视觉变换器（ViT）从RGB图像中提取丰富特征，设计了一个高效的轻量级解码器，以提升计算精度和推断速度。整个方法无需LiDAR的大量计算支持。

Result: 该方法在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到了新的SOTA性能，推断速度达到了50FPS，显著超过以往模型。

Conclusion: 提出的ROD系统不仅消除了对LiDAR数据的依赖，还提高了速度和精度，使其更加适合实时应用场景。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的开放视频数据库LIVE-YT-Banding，用于研究视频压缩中的条带伪影问题。还开发了一个新的无参考视频质量评价器CBAND，它在条带伪影预测性能和效率上均超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受条带伪影影响，高清视频的感知质量下降，对高分辨率屏幕的视觉效果尤为明显，而现有研究和数据集主要集中于静态图像，缺乏对视频时域动态条带伪影的研究。

Method: 构建了全球首个开放视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding，包括四种AV1视频编解码参数生成的160个视频，收集了7200条主观意见；并基于深度神经网络的自然图像特性嵌入，开发了无参考视频质量评估模型CBAND。

Conclusion: 新视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding的引入填补了研究空白，CBAND模型以高效的性能为条带伪影问题提供了有效解决方案。数据集、代码与预训练模型均公开。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可解释失败归因流程的新模型修复模块，通过生成语义可信的图像并过滤以增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因语义子群体代表性不足导致视觉识别模型系统性错误的问题。

Method: 使用条件文本到图像模型生成语义一致的目标图像，并通过大型视觉语言模型过滤生成结果以确保数据分布一致性。

Result: 通过带有罕见案例合成数据集的模型再训练，显著减少了与罕见案例相关的错误。

Conclusion: 提出的修复策略在提高模型鲁棒性的同时未引入新错误。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的分割损失方法ACW，结合专家注释信心，通过动态优化提高区域加权分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现以往基于CE损失的网络忽视了镜片结构的非均质性和边界校准问题，因此结合专家对不同亚区域注释信心的差异性进行改进。

Method: 提出了一种Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW)损失，按置信度将区域分为高低置信度组并进行加权分割，同时设计了动态优化置信度阈值算法。

Result: 实验表明，ACW在多个数据集上的分割性能优于现有方法。在U-Net下实现了IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE减少4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW通过利用注释信心提升了镜片结构分割的准确性，尤其在边界质量上改进显著，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，通过估计社交网络压缩和调整参数来模拟视频共享过程，从而改善深伪视频检测在真实场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深伪视频检测器在实际社交网络场景中表现较差，特别是由于平台对视频的压缩和调整使低层次的法医线索被洗掉。

Method: 设计了一个框架，通过上传少量视频估计压缩和调整参数，构建本地模拟器，该模拟器无需API访问即可在大规模数据集上复现平台特定的伪影。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据的退化模式与实际上传视频相匹配，且在模拟数据上微调的检测器表现接近于实际共享媒体训练的检测器。

Conclusion: 所提方法可扩展且实用，为解决实验室训练与真实部署之间的差距提供了有效方案，尤其适用于压缩视频内容检测的领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新的基准，用于评估系统解释自然语言的能力，特别是在全景房间图像中聚焦特定区域并从大型数据库中准确检索相应3D模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D检索系统在处理复杂、真实场景中的模糊描述识别时表现不足，因此提出ROOMELSA作为新基准。

Method: ROOMELSA提供了超过1600个公寓场景、近5200个房间和超过44000个目标查询，用于在全景房间图像中评估细粒度的3D模型检索能力。

Result: 实验表明粗粒度的对象检索基本解决，但只有一个顶尖模型能够在大多数测试用例中始终正确匹配第一名。轻量级CLIP模型性能良好，但在材料、部件结构和上下文线索的细微变化中表现不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA通过结合场景级定位与精细3D检索的能力，为推动鲁棒的现实3D识别系统建立了新基准，强调视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal为动物姿态估计提供了一种新颖的解决方案，显示了在多样场景和物种中较高的效果，特别是在复杂背景和数据稀缺情况下，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 现有的锐化技术均匀化处理忽略了纹理差异，且易增加比特率，缺乏比特分配优化技术。

Method: 提出了一种基于视频编码树单元分区掩码的区域自适应视频锐化模型RPO-AdaSharp。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，模型在质量与数据比特率上均表现良好。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp模型实现了感知增强与比特率节省的平衡。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF创新性地解决了单目设置中复杂姿态和遮挡问题，为动态人类渲染领域提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量化语义分割方法存在类别表示与图像特征对齐不佳的问题，特别是在高效场景中，这种像素分类方式导致图像特征在不同图像间具有较大变化。

Method: 设计了耦合双分支偏移学习范式，动态优化类别和特征偏移以改善表示对齐，并构建了一个高效的语义分割网络OffSeg。此外，提出的偏移学习范式可直接应用于现有方法且不需额外的结构变更。

Result: 在ADE20K、Cityscapes、COCO-Stuff-164K和Pascal Context等四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了分割性能。例如，在ADE20K数据集上，分别提升SegFormer-B0、SegNeXt-T和Mask2Former-Tiny的mIoU 2.7%、1.9%和2.6%，且仅增加了0.1-0.2M的参数。

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式具有广泛适用性，不仅在效率和性能上达成良好平衡，还能为现有语义分割方法提供一致性改进，具有显著应用潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的个性化文本到图像生成方法在多概念组合时面临身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题，急需改进。

Method: 提出了一种新的Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，通过引入token mask和优化罕见token的空间注意力分布，防止LoRA模块间的相互干扰并对准概念区域。

Conclusion: TARA解决了多LoRA模块的融合问题，提升了多概念个性化生成的质量和效率，为进一步研究和应用提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的空间推理能力仍然有限，需进一步扩展其在3D对象生成上的应用能力。

Method: 设计了一个无需额外训练数据或详细用户指令的代理式流程，包括设计师、编码器和视觉检查器，进行循环改进以生成3D原型。

Result: 生成的3D原型的渲染图像可用于图像分类预训练任务，性能比以前方法提升了15%。此外，这些原型还可用于优化视觉语言模型，提升细粒度理解能力，准确率提高了55%。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM框架无需依赖额外的人类标注数据即可提升多模态大语言模型的性能，包括图像分类和部分分割等任务。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [42] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于方向图像曲率分析的全新无参考图像质量评估(NR-IQA)框架，开发了各向异性纹理丰富度(ATR)指标，能高效识别模糊和噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无参考图像质量评估中对不同失真类型的分类和量化问题，提高与人类感知的一致性。

Method: 提出了ATR指标，通过两个可调门限优化，分成两阶段：分类失真类型（模糊 vs. 噪声），再用回归模型将ATR映射为质量分值。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，与人类感知的斯皮尔曼相关性为-0.93（高斯模糊）和-0.95（白噪声），数据集综合预测的人类评分决定系数为0.892，RMSE为5.17，误差仅为总质量范围的7.4%。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高精度图像失真分类与量化，是一种强大的双功能工具，用于评估和量化图像退化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多个数据集上显著提升了视觉效果并节省了码率。

Conclusion: 本文方法通过学习自动调整高频预处理策略，有效改善视频编码的性能和效率。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Motivation: 现有的ViTs虽然在3D点云理解中广泛使用，但其学习密集且信息丰富的语义特征能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: MaskClu将掩码点建模与聚类学习融合，通过重建掩码点云的聚类分配和中心，并引入全局对比学习机制优化实例级特征学习。

Result: MaskClu在多个3D任务测试中（如部分分割、语义分割、物体检测和分类）表现出色，设置了新的竞争性结果。

Conclusion: MaskClu通过优化密集语义重建和实例级对比学习，使ViTs能够从3D点云中学习更丰富且更语义化的表征。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Conclusion: 方法将基于坐标的神经表示与高效的体数据压缩相结合，为实际应用提供了一种可扩展且无结构的新解决方案。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

*Elman Ghazaei,Erchan Aptoula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 此论文提出了一个名为BrightVQA的新数据集和一个名为TCSSM的新模型，用于解决变化检测视觉问答中的领域转移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的变化检测方法需要专家知识，而CDVQA任务能让非专家用户更灵活地获取变化信息，但现有方法假设训练和测试数据分布相似，不适用于实际的领域转移场景。

Method: 提出了一个多模态、多领域数据集BrightVQA，以及一个新的文本条件状态空间模型(TCSSM)，通过动态预测输入参数以统一提取领域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明，TCSSM在处理领域转移问题上优于现有方法，并展示了较强的性能。

Conclusion: 方法有效地解决了CDVQA任务中的领域转移问题，新数据集和代码将公开发布以促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

### [56] [TaoCache: Structure-Maintained Video Generation Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08978)
*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文中提出了一种名为TaoCache的缓存策略，通过预测模型的噪声输出，特别是在降噪后期阶段实现加速，同时保证高分辨率结构完整性，并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的视频扩散模型加速方法可能导致结构不一致以及指令执行和角色一致性的问题，亟需一种能同时加速并保证质量的策略。

Method: 引入一种无需训练、可即插即用的TaoCache策略，以固定点角度预测模型噪声输出，并校准连续噪声增量的余弦相似性和范数比值，从而在降噪后期实现高效缓存和结构保持。

Result: 在多个框架中（如Latte-1、OpenSora-Plan v110和Wan2.1），TaoCache在相同加速条件下，相较其他缓存方法，显著提升视觉质量指标（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种无需训练的有力工具，与现有方法如Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) 和 TeaCache兼容，能够在降噪后期实现更高的高效性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

*Ding Xia,Naoto Inoue,Qianru Qiu,Kotaro Kikuchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）进行颜色推荐任务，开发了名为ColorGPT的系统，结果表明其在颜色建议和生成上的表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高设计中颜色推荐的效果，解决传统方法在颜色设计复杂性和数据有限性上的问题。

Method: 开发并验证了一个称为ColorGPT的管道，结合多种颜色表示的系统测试及有效的提示工程技术，目标为推荐颜色补全调色板，并生成基于文本描述的完整调色板。

Result: 实验结果显示，其在颜色建议的准确性、调色板完成的颜色分布，以及完整调色板生成的多样性和相似性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 证明了大型语言模型在颜色推荐任务中的优越性与潜力，提供了改善颜色推荐和生成的有效方法。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

### [58] [KFFocus: Highlighting Keyframes for Enhanced Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08989)
*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频tokens的方法，通过选取关键帧和空间-时间建模提升视频-大语言模型(Vid-LLM)的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Vid-LLM在应对长视频序列时计算成本高，并且由于均匀采样方法存在信息分布不均问题，可能遗漏关键帧的关键信息。

Method: 提出KFFocus方法，基于视频压缩原理选取关键帧，通过上下文相关的重要性为帧分配不同的压缩比率，同时引入时空建模模块，综合编码帧间的时间关系及每帧的空间结构。

Result: KFFocus在多个视频理解基准测试中表现显著优于现有方法，实现了高计算效率和更高的准确性，特别是在长视频场景中。

Conclusion: KFFocus有效解决了现有Vid-LLM方法在长视频理解中的信息丢失问题，显著提升了计算效率与性能，为未来相关研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

*Zan Wang,Jingze Zhang,Yixin Chen,Baoxiong Jia,Wei Liang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的量化方法（MSQ），通过多尺度离散tokens表征运动序列，解决了当前运动生成表示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动表示方法难以从多尺度视角捕获复杂模式的运动，同时缺乏组合灵活性。

Method: 通过多尺度量化方法（MSQ），使用不同编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部位信息，时间上插值到多个尺度，并量化为离散tokens，结合生成掩码建模支持运动编辑和控制。

Result: 与基线方法相比，在不同基准评估中，MSQ方法在定量和定性分析上表现出优越性。

Conclusion: 本方法能够无缝组合运动tokens，无需专门设计及重新训练，在多种生成任务上展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

### [60] [UniConvNet: Expanding Effective Receptive Field while Maintaining Asymptotically Gaussian Distribution for ConvNets of Any Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09000)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UniConvNet，通过合理组合小卷积核保持卷积神经网络的有效感受野(ERF)呈现渐近高斯分布，同时实现性能提高和计算效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大感受野卷积神经网络尽管表现优异，但参数与计算成本高且ERF不遵循渐近高斯分布，限制了其有效性。

Method: 引入三层感受野聚合器和层操作符，通过小卷积核组合扩展感受野并保持其渐近高斯分布。此外，开发了通用模型UniConvNet。

Result: 实验表明，UniConvNet在多个视觉任务上优于现有最先进的CNN和ViT模型。例如，在ImageNet-1K上，UniConvNet-T达到84.2%的精度，参数仅30M，计算量为5.1G。

Conclusion: UniConvNet证明大感受野无需依赖巨型卷积核，能够在性能和计算效率间取得平衡，为多尺度模型提供了一种普适性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/ai-paperwithcode/UniConvNet.

### [61] [Towards Perfection: Building Inter-component Mutual Correction for Retinex-based Low-light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09009)
*Luyang Cao,Han Xu,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Jiayi Ma,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IRetinex的新模型，通过减少分解和增强阶段的组件间残差（ICR）来改进低光图像的增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinex方法因其解读性强而被广泛应用于低光图像增强，但分解过程中产生的组件间残差（ICR）影响了最终图像质量，尚未被充分重视。

Method: 提出了IRetinex模型，在图像分解阶段通过减少特征相似性减少ICR；在增强阶段利用组件间的特征相似性检测并缓解ICR的影响。

Result: 通过在三个低光数据集上的实验，IRetinex在定性和定量表现上均优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 减少ICR是改进低光图像增强效果的关键，IRetinex方法验证了其有效性并提高了图像质量。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Motivation: 当前半监督学习方法在分割任务中依赖一致性正则化，但存在对学生模型的依赖较重和认知偏差等问题。此外，现有共训练方法生成高置信伪标签存在挑战。

Method: UC-Seg框架通过两个子网络探索其间的相关性，减少模型认知偏差。同时，引入跨子网一致性保留策略(CCP)增强特征表示能力，并通过不确定性感知伪标签生成(UPG)组件生成高置信标签。

Result: UC-Seg在MRI、CT、超声等多种医学图像分割任务上表现出更高的分割精度和良好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UC-Seg成功缓解了认知偏差，提升了特征一致性，并通过不确定性感知生成了高置信伪标签，在医学图像分割方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

*Zhiqiang Yang,Renshuai Tao,Xiaolong Zheng,Guodong Yang,Chunjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DPGNet的新方法，用于应对深伪检测中依赖标注数据的难题，特别是在AI内容越来越逼真的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI内容的逼真度提高，深伪检测的标注变得困难且费时，需要有效利用在线社交网络中大量未标注数据的新方法。

Method: 本文提出Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet)，包括文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，同时利用跨域知识蒸馏避免遗忘问题。

Result: 实验在11个热门数据集上表明，DPGNet在深伪检测任务中比当前最优方法性能高出6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过有效利用未标注数据解决了视觉上生成内容与真实内容的相似性难题，在深伪检测任务中展现了良好效果。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Motivation: 许多文献独立增强视觉语言动作模型的空间或时间理解能力。本研究期望综合这两者，为虚拟及现实场景中的动作预测提升能力。

Method: 采用视觉提示法——将视觉观察的关键点投影至深度图，以捕捉空间和时间信息，并在SimplerEnv实验环境中验证此方法。

Result: 实验显示，与SpatialVLA相比，任务完成率提升4%；与TraceVLA相比，提升19%；且在数据稀缺条件下仍有效。

Conclusion: 视觉提示法能高效捕捉空间和时间信息，对数据有限的实际场景具有重要价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Conclusion: 引入的个性化步骤与损失函数有效增强了模型对于特定概念的个性化学习能力，具有广泛的适用性与实用价值。

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种适应实际动态环境的视频异常检测（VAD）方法，引入主动学习框架和“人-机”协同机制，通过新指标（EBI）验证其有效性，显著提升动态环境中VAD的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAD方法在动态人类行为、环境变化以及领域转移中难以适用，传统测评方法难以定义动态场景中的正常与异常行为分界线。全新方法旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用主动学习框架选择最有信息量的数据点进行标注，并引入“人-机”协同机制，通过AI生成的伪标签校准实际正常与异常实例，同时定义适应不同环境的动态阈值，增强系统适配性。

Result: 在模拟真实世界场景的实验中，该方法在Q3阶段实现了EBI指标68.91的性能，验证了其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的VAD提供了更强大的适应性和实用潜力，分界明确且具有良好性能，有望在真实场景中广泛应用。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 传统的视觉语言模型多阶段结合传统目标检测器的方法容易导致误差传播，降低感知准确性，因此需要更加高效的端到端解决方案。

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，并利用Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 适应驾驶任务，设计了联合语义几何损失，包括早期训练的语义损失和后期改进3D边界框预测的IoU损失，保证稳定收敛和高精度。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的评估显示，VLM-3D的联合损失设计将感知准确性提高了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D框架验证了其在自动驾驶感知任务中的高效性和先进性，克服了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在眼科领域的偏见问题，提出了一种基于对比学习框架的无标签去偏见方法，通过自适应优化来减少子群间差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前VLM在多模态任务上虽表现优异，但在一些关键应用场景（如青光眼筛查中）可能会有系统性偏见。本研究的动机是开发一种能够公平评估和筛查不同群体青光眼风险的模型。

Method: 该方法基于一种重加权的对比学习框架，依次执行以下步骤：1）通过无监督聚类获得代理子群，2）利用CLIP多模态损失与SimCLR图像对比损失计算梯度相似性权重，3）在联合目标下利用这些权重优化模型表现，重点提升低表现的子群。

Result: 通过在Harvard FairVLMed青光眼子集上的实验，研究展示了所提方法在平等性指标（如Equalized Odds Distance, Equalized Subgroup AUC和Groupwise AUC）上显著改善，表现出对各分群的公平性。

Conclusion: 此研究证明，通过去偏见的无标签方法，可以显著减小VLM在关键医疗场景上的偏见，为公平的青光眼筛查提供了可能的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

TL;DR: 本研究提出利用深度学习模型改进脸部识别系统反欺骗能力，特别是针对深伪技术攻击，可达到99.9%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脸部识别反欺骗技术难以应对深伪技术等复杂攻击，导致系统安全性受到威胁。

Method: 采用创新性的深度学习模型，通过集成纹理分析和反射特性，区分真人和伪造身份，并在五种不同数据集上进行广泛评估。

Result: 最佳模型（AttackNet V2.2）在混合数据训练下的平均准确率达到99.9%，显著优于现有系统，同时揭示了冒充攻击的行为模式。

Conclusion: 本研究显著提升了脸部识别安全性能，并提供了对复杂假冒技术本质的新洞见，为多个依赖安全访问的行业增强了信心。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Turbo-VAED的轻量化视频VAE解码器，大幅提高了在移动设备上的效率及性能，同时保留了较高的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模生成式AI模型的移动化需求不断增加，现有视频生成模型中的VAE因计算瓶颈在移动设备上表现不佳，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: 通过分析现有VAE架构的冗余，结合3D深度可分离卷积优化参数；提出一种适合移动硬件的解耦3D像素调度方案，并开发通用的移动优化VAE解码器Turbo-VAED；使用解码器蒸馏技术代替重训VAE以实现快速迁移，有效控制训练成本。

Result: 首次实现了移动设备上的实时720p视频VAE解码。相比于原始VAE，Turbo-VAED在GPU上加速效果高达84.5倍，参数量减少至原来的17.5%，并保留96.9%的重建精度。在iPhone 16 Pro上的帧率提升了2.9倍，同时具有更高的重建质量。

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED能够在移动设备运行大规模视频生成任务，广泛适用于现有视频VAE领域，兼顾极低的训练成本及高效性能，将推动生成式AI技术的移动化发展。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量的公开数据集，特别是全身人类捕捉数据，为数字人的重新光照和新视角渲染带来研究限制。

Method: 设计并发布了首个全身人类多视角OLAT（逐光）大规模数据集HumanOLAT，数据包括HDR RGB帧，光照条件涵盖白光、环境贴图、渐变色彩和细粒度OLAT。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT数据集为未来研究提供了宝贵资源，将促进通用和人类特定再光照与渲染技术的进一步发展和基准测试。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Putnam-AXIOM，一个包含522道来自高水平数学竞赛问题的基准测试和100个功能性变体问题的新型数学推理评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大模型的数学推理能力评估基准接近饱和，且容易受训练集污染影响，缺乏动态性。

Method: 提出了基于William Lowell Putnam竞赛问题的动态基准测试，并通过程序化扰动生成无限数量等难度问题。

Result: 主流模型在原始测试集上表现较好（最高41.9%），但在动态变体测试中准确率显著下降（最多减少19.6%）。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM提供了一个抗污染、动态的数学推理能力评估框架，可用于更严格地评测模型表现。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提升金融交流中论证质量的评估能力，并测试LLMs在可靠性和性别偏见方面的表现。

Method: 对三种LLMs（GPT-4o、Llama 3.1、Gemma 2）在FinArgQuality数据集上的标注能力进行实验，测试其一致性和偏见响应，实验设置不同温度参数。

Result: LLMs标注的一致性优于人类标注，但仍存在性别偏见，不同温度条件下的表现具有差异性。

Conclusion: 提出关于改进LLMs标注可靠性和减少偏见的建议，为未来研究提供参考。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

Motivation: 为了解决推文中科学论述的自动检测问题，以便准确识别科学相关内容。

Method: 提出三种辩论方式（单一辩论、团队辩论和议会辩论），最终选用表现最佳的议会辩论方法。

Result: 议会辩论方法在识别科学研究引用上表现最佳，排名第一；但在科学论述和科学实体提及的检测上排名较低。

Conclusion: 议会辩论方法有效但有限，需要进一步改进以提升对其他任务的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

TL;DR: 研究探讨语言模型在认知和情感共情方面的表现，发现大型语言模型在认知共情上表现优于人类，但情感共情方面较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解语言模型在认知与情感共情中的能力，以评估其作为虚拟助手或伴侣的潜力。

Method: 通过标准的心理测试，分析多种小型和大型语言模型的认知和情感共情能力，并与人类（包括心理学学生）的表现进行对比。

Result: 大型语言模型在认知共情任务上超越了人类，被证明具有强大的认知能力；但在人类情感共情能力方面显著低于人类。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型具备强大的认知共情潜力，可为虚拟陪伴和情感支持提供可能性，同时其较低的情感共情能力避免了情绪疲劳及偏见的风险。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

Motivation: 目标是改进新闻阅读体验，通过将新闻文章与特定的事件或故事关联，以增强新闻监控系统的效果。

Method: 结合文本表示技术（如命名实体识别）、聚类算法以及在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream和TextClust），实时为新闻文章分配到相关的故事主题中。

Result: 基于一个月的斯洛文尼亚新闻数据集进行评估，实验结果表明该方法在实时性和准确性方面表现优秀，得到了人类评估者的认同。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效地解决故事识别问题，在实时新闻流中准确地分组并生成有意义的主题分析。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

Motivation: 现有的临床语言模型在处理非结构化电子健康记录时往往面临可信度和解释性问题。

Method: 提出了一种包含关键词提取与基于关键词的链式推理的框架TT-XAI，结合精炼关键词后BERT分类器与关键词引导的提示词来生成解释。

Result: 该方法在多种评价方式下均表现出显著提升，包括删除测试指标、自评得分与专家盲评。

Conclusion: TT-XAI对临床决策中的AI可信性与可审计性提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

Motivation: 应对社交媒体上迅速增加的仇恨言论，当前的黑盒模型缺乏可解释性，提出新方法以提供透明性与准确性。

Method: 通过利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，SCBM将输入文本映射到抽象的形容词表示，并通过轻量级分类器实现下游任务的预测。

Result: SCBM在五个多语言、多平台的基准测试数据集上取得平均macro-F1分数0.69，且在四个数据集上超过了现有最佳结果。与变压器嵌入融合后性能提高了1.8%。

Conclusion: SCBM提供了一种紧凑、可解释且高效的仇恨和反仇恨言论识别编码方式，此外，该方法也可扩展应用到其他自然语言处理任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

Motivation: 探讨如何在大规模模型中定位与特定认知任务因果相关的单元，并评估这些单元的功能性。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，通过有针对性的去除(‘消融’)评估它们的因果作用，比较不同选取方法对任务表现的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能的削弱更大。此外，用数学任务为基础的定位器提取的单元对ToM任务的表现削弱更显著。

Conclusion: 对比式的定位器存在局限性，需要更广泛的刺激集来更准确地捕获任务特定的单元。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,

reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 提出MinionsLLM框架，将大型语言模型与行为树和形式语法结合，用于多智能体系统的自然语言控制，并通过两种数据集生成方法提升模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统自然语言控制中语法有效性和任务相关性问题。

Method: 通过结合LLMs、行为树和形式语法设计框架，采用两种方法生成合成数据集以微调LLMs。

Result: 验证表明Method B将语法有效性提升到92.6%，任务性能平均提高33%。

Conclusion: 小模型微调收益最大，适合资源有限场景，多智能体控制研究潜力巨大，框架为开源。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在检测虚假生成内容方面的评估偏差，并指出目前基于ROUGE的评估方法存在严重问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示ROUGE等传统评估指标在检测虚假内容准确性方面的局限性，强调人类一致性评价的重要性。

Method: 通过综合的人类研究，评估现有虚假检测方法性能，并分析不同评估标准如ROUGE和LLM-as-Judge之间的对比。

Result: 发现ROUGE具有高召回率但极低的精准率，且多个成熟检测方法在基于人类一致性指标的评估下表现下降。此外，简单启发式方法如句子长度可能媲美复杂检测技术。

Conclusion: 需要采用语义感知且稳健的评估框架，来真实衡量检测方法性能，从而提高LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为FiqhQA的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型(LLM)在生成与伊斯兰教法相关的回答时的表现，特别关注四大逊尼派学派的准确性和避答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在许多领域的问答应用中表现出色，但在宗教领域（如伊斯兰教法）中的可靠性和准确性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出FiqhQA基准，使用零样本实验和避答测试，针对四个主流逊尼派学派，以评估LLM的回答准确性和避开回答不确定问题的能力，同时进行英阿双语对比。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最好，但Gemini和Fanar则在避答行为上表现更优。所有模型在阿拉伯语上的表现均明显下降，表明它们在非英语语言的宗教推理中存在局限性。

Conclusion: 首次在伊斯兰教法细分领域基准测试LLM，研究结果强调应对特定任务的评估需求以及在宗教应用中谨慎部署LLM的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CoDAE框架，通过链式思维（CoT）数据增强方法，改进大型语言模型（LLMs），使其更适用于教育场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通常的LLMs在教育场景下表现欠佳，例如：过早给出答案、无法根据学生的不确定性调整回应、容易受到情绪操控影响。

Method: 通过COT数据增强，这一框架收集学生与ChatGPT辅导对话数据，设计针对性对话案例，解决模型的过度服从性、低反应适应性，以及对威胁的易感性，并对模型进行微调。

Result: 研究证明，经过CoDAE微调的模型能提供更切合教育的指导、支持推理过程，并有效避免过早披露答案。

Conclusion: CoDAE框架通过数据增强和微调策略，有效提升了LLMs教育应用的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何提升大语言模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现中的推理能力），尤其是在分子数据复杂性及高质量标注稀缺条件下的表现。

Method: 提出了一种高质量推理数据集生成方法（PRID），并通过分子迭代适应（MoIA）策略，结合监督微调与强化策略优化来提升推理模型的性能。

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1框架证明了其在分子推理生成中具有显著优势，可为该领域提供新的思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) with Reinforced Policy Optimization (RPO),
tailored to boost the reasoning performance of R1-like reasoning models for
molecule discovery. Finally, we examine the performance of Mol-R1 in the
text-based molecule reasoning generation task, showing superior performance
against existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了形态学对齐的分词方法在复杂形态语言上的性能影响，发现分词算法比形态学对齐对下游任务性能影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探讨不同分词算法在形态复杂语言上的表现，解决先前研究中关于形态学对齐分词是否有助于提升性能的矛盾结论。

Method: 选取泰卢固语（黏着型）、印地语（融合型）和英语（融合型）三种语言，通过训练分词器、微调和下游任务评估，重点考察形态学对齐和分词质量，并为泰卢固语创建包含派生和屈折词形的金标准形态分割数据集。

Result: 形态学对齐与语法任务性能之间存在适度的正相关。分词算法对性能影响更大，简单的Unigram算法整体表现优于其他，结合形态分割的BPE分词器在BPE框架下表现理想。

Conclusion: 形态对齐虽然有助于特定任务，但分词算法（如Unigram）的选择是影响语言模型性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: 研究通过简单的目标函数修改提升小型LLM在人类偏好对齐中的表现，尤其是在资源有限的情况下表现显著增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何改进小型LLM，在性能受限的条件下更好地对齐人类偏好。

Method: 提出了两种轻量的基于DPO方法的变体：Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero，利用基于边界的目标和选择性更新机制改善性能不足场景。

Result: 在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench中，APO-hinge-zero方法在多个任务类别中保持了竞争力，特别是在STEM和人文学科任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过简单的目标函数修改，可以在资源受限的情况下显著提高小型LLM的人类偏好对齐能力，为高效部署提供了可能路径。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了在推理过程中，大型语言模型的隐藏状态从一个token变到下一个token时的变化，发现它们的变化可与物理学中的能量类似，并保持近乎恒定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过物理学的角度，旨在理解和控制大型语言模型在推理中的内部机制，增强模型的可解释性、预测性及与人类意图的对齐能力。

Method: 提出了一种称为Jacobian steering的控制方法，通过最小程度地干预模型隐藏状态以偏向目标token，并采用“log-Lagrangian”方法来分析和控制模型行为。

Result: 提出的Jacobian steering方法在保持近乎恒定能量的基础上，生成的文本在语义质量上优于模型自然生成的结果。

Conclusion: 从力学角度看待Transformer模型，为模型解释性、异常检测及低风险调整提供了理论基础，可帮助使模型更可预测并符合人类意图。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法如RLHF仅能反映平均用户偏好，多元对齐旨在捕获用户对多个属性的多样化偏好，从而扩展超越单纯的“有帮助性”和“无害性”。

Method: 提出基于少样本比较回归的可调节多元模型，利用上下文学习处理和基于精细粒度的属性，比较不同响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 该模型在提出的两个新基准测试中表现优异，相较于基线和现有技术均具有优势，并且具备可解释性和兼容性。

Conclusion: 研究推进了多元对齐的研究方向，为LLM的公平和代表性应用提供了新思路，也在伦理AI领域取得了进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过编码器-解码器模型更高效地生成高质量压缩表示，以优化计算资源利用率。

Method: 利用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过强调压缩质量的修改实现token级压缩，并权衡计算成本与质量。

Result: DeCAL在2倍压缩率下可与未压缩数据的效果媲美，在高达8倍压缩时仅在少数任务上略有性能下降。

Conclusion: DeCAL方法在预计算稠密表示的使用场景下节省了大量成本，并具有扩展为广泛适用工具的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型在许多领域有广泛应用，但抑郁预测因缺乏高质量数据集而存在障碍。本研究旨在填补这一数据空白并探索可解释的AI抑郁预测模型。

Method: 研究设计了DepressLLM，使用了3,699份新颖自传叙述语料库进行训练和评估，并引入Score-guided Token Probability Summation（SToPS）模块，同时在多种数据集上进行验证。

Result: DepressLLM在核心测试数据集上的AUC达到0.789，而当信心高于0.95时AUC提升至0.904，通过对异质数据集和公开数据的评估进一步验证了模型的稳健性。

Conclusion: DepressLLM证明了可解释性人工智能在抑郁症早期诊断的潜力，同时揭示了模型和数据限制，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: 在现有数据稀缺和语言多样性情况下，RAG系统难以理解和生成地道的广东话口语，需要探索参数高效的微调方法以实现改进。

Method: 评估了LoRA在RAG框架中的整合，分析了基于LoRA变体、合成数据生成、用户反馈以及自适应参数分配的方法对计算效率、检索精度和语言真实性的影响。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA能显著减少可训练参数，同时在方言上下文中维持较高的检索和生成质量，但在细粒度语言细节上仍有不足。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在特定领域语言任务中前景广阔，但未来需瞄准方言真实性、动态适应性和可扩展的微调管道的相关研究。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习研究主要在特定领域进行推理（如数学或代码生成），无法反映真实世界多样性需求。因此需要能涵盖广泛任务环境的开源框架。

Method: 开发InternBootcamp框架，包括任务环境的自动生成（具多种难度级别）和集成验证模块进行结果评估，并结合手动验证提升效率。此外，创建Bootcamp-EVAL自动化基准评估模型性能。

Result: 通过InternBootcamp训练的模型在推理任务上的表现显著提升，提出的32B模型实现了最新成果并优于其他基准测试。

Conclusion: 更大规模的多样化任务训练（即任务扩展）显著提升了模型的泛化推理能力，为开发强大的泛用性推理模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型快速发展，移动任务自动化逐渐成为可能，但现有方法缺乏对人类隐性意图流（如个人偏好）的关注，难以实现个性化的移动任务代理。

Method: 通过收集MobileIAR数据集，采用IFRAgent框架分析人类演示的显性与隐性意图流，结合检索增强生成与查询改写生成个性化查询及操作步骤。

Result: 实验结果表明，IFRAgent在意图对齐率方面比基线平均提高6.79%，步骤完成率提高5.30%。

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过显隐意图流分析和个性化生成，有效增强了移动任务代理与人类意图的对齐能力，在自动化移动操作任务中表现突出。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在复合方面情感分析任务上的表现落后于微调模型，探索调优后LLMs在ABSA任务的潜力具有重要意义。

Method: 研究评估了经过微调的开源LLMs在4个任务和8个数据集上的表现，并进行了误差分析。

Result: 结果表明，微调的Orca~2模型在所有任务上都超过了最先进的结果，但在零样本和少样本场景下仍存在困难。

Conclusion: 微调LLMs在ABSA任务中表现优异，但需克服在零样本和少样本情况下的局限性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their
performance in compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks lags
behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA
remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs
fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the
performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the
fine-tuned Orca~2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks.
However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to
fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify
challenges faced by fine-tuned models.

Abstract: This paper presents our system built for the WASSA-2024 Cross-lingual Emotion
Detection Shared Task. The task consists of two subtasks: first, to assess an
emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five
languages, and second, to predict words triggering the detected emotions in
binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning
quantized large language models, specifically Orca~2, with low-rank adapters

enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger
word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent
performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary
trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法（TopXGen），利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成高质量、多样化的低资源语言（LRL）目标语句，这些语句可以通过回译生成有用的平行文本，用于翻译的上下文学习和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在进行低资源语言（LRLs）的翻译时，LLM表现不如高资源语言（HRLs）。现有的改善方法因平行数据集的规模和质量受限，提出一种新方法以创造更好的低资源语言数据。

Method: 通过LLM生成高质量、多样化的LRL目标文本，然后利用回译生成平行语料，强化翻译模型的上下文学习与微调性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用TopXGen生成的数据显著提升了LLM在翻译微调和上下文学习中的表现。

Conclusion: TopXGen成功生成高质量的LRL数据，有效提升翻译性能，其成果在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

TL;DR: 该研究测试了在老年荷兰人群体中使用最先进的 ASR 模型，并发现通用多语言模型的表现优于专门微调模型，同时找到了模型在精度与处理速度之间的平衡方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决针对老年人群体自动语音识别 (ASR) 精度不足这一瓶颈，以支持老人在临床环境中使用语音控制界面，例如聊天机器人。

Method: 采用当前最先进的 ASR 模型进行对比测试，包括通用多语言模型和为荷兰语专门微调的模型，同时还考虑了处理速度问题。

Result: 测试结果表明，通用多语言 ASR 模型的总体性能优于专门为老年人微调的模型。此外，通过模型结构截断可以优化精度与处理速度的平衡，但某些情况下模型仍存在较高错误率（WER），例如因幻觉现象导致。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的 ASR 模型已能够无须专门微调即可较好地泛化到实际数据集，且在性能与速度上可通过适当策略进行优化，但针对特定群体（如老龄人群）仍需注意某些特定失误问题。

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为IROTE的新方法，旨在通过上下文生成稳定且可转移的人类特质模拟，比现有方法更优，解决了LLMs在模拟人类特质上的表面化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在模拟人类特质时表现为表层化和不稳定，未能在不同的任务中精确且一致地体现目标特质，限制了其在个性化和社会模拟等领域的应用潜力。

Method: 提出IROTE方法，通过心理学理论中的反思机制，在提示中自动生成和优化自我反思文本，以增强模型行为与目标特质的联系，同时减少冗余噪声。优化基于信息论目标，无需模型微调即可实现稳定紧凑的特质反映。

Result: 实验覆盖三个人类特质系统表明，单一通过IROTE生成的自我反思即可在多样化的任务中稳定地模拟目标特质，性能优于现有先进基线。

Conclusion: IROTE方法在无需模型微调的情况下，通过自反性提示有效实现了大型语言模型对目标人类特质的稳定模拟，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法在医学通俗语言生成任务中无法兼顾语义保真性和风格多样性，且面对多源异构数据集表现较差。

Method: Magical通过共享矩阵A进行抽象总结，结合多个隔离矩阵B实现多样化通俗语言生成，引入语义不变性约束防止语义空间偏移，并利用推荐引导开关切换不同矩阵。

Result: 实验结果显示，Magical在三种真实通俗语言生成数据集上表现优于提示方法、普通LoRA及其改进版本，并减少了31.66%的可训练参数量。

Conclusion: Magical在保持语义保真和生成风格多样性的同时，提升了医学通俗语言生成的效率和质量，证明其为复杂异构数据场景下的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门为RAG-LLMs中的重排序器评估开发的基准测试，为科学文献问答领域提供了宝贵的观察和指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured

critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RAG系统在匿名实体场景下知识检索的问题，同时应对隐私泄露风险。

Method: 提出两个抽象策略：关系中心抽象捕捉实体周边语义，结构导向抽象将问题转化为抽象概念路径，以增强知识检索性能。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证ARoG框架表现出高性能和隐私稳健性。

Conclusion: ARoG框架在隐私保护和信息检索效率上均有显著提升，为处理匿名知识图谱的RAG系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过强化学习改进LLMs与环境交互中的工具使用性能，这需要高效的训练框架及有效的奖励机制。

Method: 设计了自动化环境构建流水线，包括场景分解、文档生成等，同时提出可验证的工具使用奖励机制，并结合标准强化学习算法进行模型训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法提升了不同规模LLMs在工具使用上的性能，同时保持了其总体能力。

Conclusion: 改进了上下文理解和推理能力，表明通过强化学习优化底层MLP参数能改善工具使用效果。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为TiMoE的时间感知的语言专家混合模型，通过时间分段的预训练和因果路由方法解决大语言模型（LLMs）在时间相关任务上的陈旧性和时间幻觉问题，并开源其代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLMs知识容易过时且存在时间泄露问题，作者旨在开发一种模型，使其能够在时间相关任务上具有更优的表现，同时保持因果有效性。

Method: 通过将一个2013-2024语料库分成若干两年时间段，分别训练GPT-style专家，并使用TiMoE根据查询时间屏蔽未来训练数据的专家，同时整合剩余专家的预测结果。

Result: 在8个标准NLP任务和一个含10,000个问题的时序问答基准（TSQA）上，TiMoE的表现与最佳单时间段专家相当或更优，时间幻觉错误率降低最多15%。

Conclusion: 基于模块化时间分段预训练和因果路由的LLMs是一种简单但有效的方式，能够在保持整体性能的同时，解决模型的时间相关问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal

### [111] [An Investigation of Robustness of LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning: Benchmarking with Mathematically-Equivalent Transformation of Advanced Mathematical Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08833)
*Yuren Hao,Xiang Wan,Chengxiang Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 引入了一种新的评价框架，以更系统地评估LLMs在数学推理方面的鲁棒性，基于语言和参数变化测试其对等价数学问题的敏感性，并提出了新的基准数据集PutnamGAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以精准评估LLMs的数学推理能力，因此需要更系统的方法来揭示其对数学问题的鲁棒性和敏感性。

Method: 通过设计多个数学等价但具有语言和参数变化的问题来测试LLMs，并创建了新的基准数据集PutnamGAP，用此数据集评估不同LLMs的表现。

Result: 测试了18种LLMs后发现，模型在经语言和步骤改动的问题上表现严重下降。比如，OpenAI的O3模型在原始问题上得分49%，但在表面变体和核心步骤变体问题上的分数分别下降了4%和10.5%。

Conclusion: 新的评价框架能够有效深化对LLMs鲁棒性的理解，并提供改进其数学推理能力的重要见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分析和减轻解码器型大语言模型（LLM）中政治经济偏见的方法，利用对比性数据对隐藏层激活状态进行分析并通过矢量调整偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各类实际场景中的广泛应用，其潜在的意识形态偏见可能引发问题，尤其是在政治和经济维度上的偏见问题需要解决。

Method: 以政治罗盘测试(PCT)为基础，使用对比对分析模型如Mistral和DeepSeek的隐藏层激活状态，并开发逐层分析的激活提取管道，最终通过方向向量调整实现偏见缓解。

Result: 研究表明解码器LLM在所有层次上系统性地编码了偏见，可以被有效地利用灵活方向向量的方法进行矫正。

Conclusion: 本文不仅揭示了LLM如何在内部表征中编码政治偏见，还提出了一种比表面输出干预更深层的方法进行偏见矫正。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

*Sekh Mainul Islam,Nadav Borenstein,Siddhesh Milind Pawar,Haeun Yu,Arnav Arora,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BiasGym的方法，通过注入和分析偏见，来研究和缓解大语言模型中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的权重中可能存在偏见和刻板印象，这些偏见潜在害处大且往往难以察觉，因此需要新工具来系统地挖掘并缓解偏见。

Method: BiasGym包含两个主要组件：1) BiasInject，通过基于token的微调向模型中注入特定偏见，模型其他部分保持不变；2) BiasScope，根据注入的偏见信号来定位和调整产生偏见行为的模型组件。该框架还支持分析机制、定向去偏见以及泛化到训练时未出现的偏见。

Result: 该研究验证了BiasGym在减少真实世界刻板印象（如国籍与驾驶习惯的联系）以及探索虚构联系（如国籍和皮肤颜色的联系）方面的有效性，为偏见缓解和模型可解释性提供了有益手段。

Conclusion: BiasGym能够可靠地注入、分析和缓解大语言模型中的偏见，其通用性与成本效益使其适用于安全干预及解释性研究。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Sqator的工具，用于自动评估放射学报告的质量，旨在解决人工评估耗时且可能存在主观偏差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告的质量评估过程需要资深医生进行主观判断，不仅成本高昂，还可能因多种因素导致评分不准确。

Method: 提出了Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator)，通过文本微观的span级语义差异分析，而非通用的文档级比较方法，来评估质量分数。最终根据修订的span重要性及分数综合生成QA分数。

Result: 实验基于12,013份放射学报告，结果显示Sqator的QA分数表现具有竞争力，并且修订span的重要性分数与资深医生的判断一致。

Conclusion: Sqator可以自动化并优化放射学报告的质控流程，有效减少人工劳动和主观偏差，非常适合辅助医疗场景的应用。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文旨在研究大型语言模型(LLMs)对文化理解的偏见及其内部机制，提出了首个基于机制解释的方法——Culturescope，用于探测LLMs的文化知识空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在全球范围的部署引发了对其文化理解中偏见的关注，现有研究多集中于外在评估，缺乏对模型内部机制与文化表现关联的探讨。

Method: 提出了Culturescope方法，利用修补技术从LLMs的内部表示中提取文化知识，并引入文化扁平化评分来衡量文化偏见程度。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs内部存在西方主导性偏见和文化扁平化现象，且低资源文化因训练数据有限而较少受偏见影响。

Conclusion: 此研究为未来减少文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解能力的研究奠定了基础，其代码和数据公开可用以支持后续工作。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ASPD的新方法，通过自动提取并验证自回归模型中的可并行结构，实现了大语言模型推理速度的显著提升，同时保持高质量的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型推理延迟较高，尤其在自回归解码时受限于token预测的顺序性。本研究重新审视了自回归模型的输出，发现其中存在可并行的结构，提出利用这些结构以提高推理效率。

Method: 设计了一种自适应串行-并行解码(ASPD)方法，包括自动构建可并行数据和高效并行解码机制的两部分。具体采用了一种无侵入式流水线自动提取并验证自回归模型的可并行结构，并通过一个混合解码引擎实现串并行模式无缝切换。

Result: 在包括通用任务、基于检索生成和数学推理等多个评测中，ASPD展现了显著的效果与效率。在Vicuna Bench上，平均实现1.85倍，最高达3.19倍的推理加速，同时保持生成质量仅降低1%。

Conclusion: ASPD框架显著加速了大语言模型推理，为延迟敏感应用如AI客服和答案检索引擎的使用提供了重要支持，并为高效并行推理设定了新标杆。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）因标注数据有限及方言复杂而使语音识别系统开发困难的问题。

Method: 通过两阶段方法，第一阶段利用15,000小时的弱标注语音对模型进行预训练，第二阶段结合弱标注数据和小规模的高质量标注数据进行持续监督微调。

Result: 所提出的方法在多方言阿拉伯语语音识别挑战中排名第一，显示了优越性能。

Conclusion: 弱监督学习结合监督微调可有效解决低资源、方言丰富语言的ASR开发困难，为此类语言提供高质量语音识别模型。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的推理能力评估多集中在高资源语言（如英语）上，亟需探索其在低资源语言中的表现。

Method: 研究主要通过手动翻译一个多步骤推理数据集（从英语到孟加拉语），并对小型多语言模型在原版和翻译数据上的表现进行对比评估。

Result: 在相同设置下，推理背景信息对处理更复杂的非二元问题有帮助，但模型在有效利用孟加拉语推理步方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 不同语言和模型在使用推理步骤时的表现存差异，这强调了理解低资源语言推理能力的必要性。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

Motivation: 目前在提升大型语言模型推理能力时，采用固定长度预算的方式限制计算成本，但未能利用学习过程中的探索与压缩自然递进关系。

Method: 提出了一种基于课程学习的长度控制推理策略，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO），通过从宽松的预算逐步收紧预算来优化模型的推理过程，并设置平衡任务正确性、长度效率和格式忠实度的奖励函数。

Result: 在GSM8K, MATH500, SVAMP, College Math, 和 GSM+等数据集上进行实验，结果表明基于课程学习的训练方式在相同预算下优于固定预算基线，具有更高精度和明显更优的令牌使用效率。

Conclusion: 进阶约束策略设计是一种有效的归纳偏差，可用于高效推理模型训练，并通过奖励权重及衰减计划的消融实验进一步验证了其效果。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

Motivation: 大型语言模型尽管性能卓越，但因“幻觉”现象的存在，导致其结果的可信性受到质疑。现有方法多集中于解决答案和归因准确性的问题，但在生成和归因关联上存有不足。

Method: 提出LoDIT方法，该方法通过两步实现：(1) 给文档标记特定标记符号并利用这些标记的标记预测评估每个文档对答案的贡献；(2) 聚合这些贡献形成文档归因。

Conclusion: LoDIT展示了在答案生成过程中同步精准归因的能力，解决了当前方法的短板，为提升大型语言模型的信任度提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法主要集中于输入上下文，但未能解决长序列解码过程中累积的注意力误差问题。

Method: 通过RetroAttention技术，在新增KV条目时重新审视并修正先前的注意力输出，同时保持轻量的输出缓存以提高效率。

Result: 在长生成任务上，RetroAttention显著优于现有KV压缩方法，将有效KV曝光率提高了最多1.6倍，准确率提高了最多21.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统固定注意力输出的模式，通过回顾性校正有效解决长序列解码问题，并对长上下文任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MVISU-Bench的基准，用以评估移动智能代理系统，并开发了Aider模块显著提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动智能代理评估基准未能真实反映复杂多样化的用户需求。

Method: 通过用户问卷收集多种任务需求，构建MVISU-Bench基准，并提出Aider模块优化任务完成效果。

Result: Aider模块将总体成功率提升了19.55%，其中在不道德指令和交互式指令的成功率分别提升了53.52%和29.41%。

Conclusion: Aider模块能够有效弥补当前移动代理系统与真实世界用户期望之间的差距。

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的高效推理方法READER，利用文本中的自我重复性，提升了大语言模型的解码速度，并在无需额外训练的情况下达到了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理过程因其序列生成的特性面临效率瓶颈，特别是在工业应用中的大批量场景（批量大小>=8）中，亟需能够有效加速解码过程的方法。

Method: 提出了READER，一种无损的推测解码方法，通过统计搜索扩展推测解码树，并优化了涉及大批量任务的关键值缓存机制。

Result: READER相较于现有方法具有显著的性能提升，在无需额外训练且重复使用预训练模型的情况下，加速比超过40%，在基于搜索的任务中（如检索增强生成）实现超过10倍的加速。

Conclusion: READER方法在效率和适用性上表现优异，为高效部署大语言模型提供了一条新的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

*Xinge Ye,Rui Wang,Yuchuan Wu,Victor Ma,Feiteng Fang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用比较分组评分代替样本评分的CPO方法，改进了主观任务的强化学习微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模在主观任务中面对评价标准的主观性和奖励信号的不稳定性问题，需要一种更稳定客观的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为CPO的新方法，从样本级评分转为比较组评分，并引入CharacterArena评估框架，包括多轮角色模拟和轨迹比较评估两阶段。

Result: 实验表明CPO在多种基准测试中缓解了奖励歧义问题，并显著提升了对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO通过新的奖励评价方法对主观任务的强化学习微调实现了更高效的优化和更稳定的结果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合多层信息的新模型，显著提升LLM在低资源语言上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在低资源语言上的性能较差，而目前的方法如LangBridge对中间层信息利用不足，仅基于最终编码层展开工作。

Method: 利用全局Softmax权重和Transformer Softmax模型融合多层信息，同时将融合后的表示映射至LLM的嵌入空间。训练仅基于英语数据，无需多语言或平行数据。

Result: 在XNLI、IndicXNLI、新拉特语新闻分类、亚马逊评论等任务上表现优异，其中在新拉特语分类准确率由71.66%提升至75.86%，XNLI平均准确率由70.36%提升至71.50%。

Conclusion: 提出的模型通过数据高效的方法提升了多语言处理能力，尤其是低资源语言，具有可扩展性和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过程行业中事件日志记录碎片化的问题，从而提升操作优化、安全保障及持续改进能力。

Method: 将跨文档指称解决技术与自然语言推断和语义文本相似性相结合，适配到过程工业的特定文本格式，并设计记录链接模型进行实验。

Result: 提出的记录链接模型在性能上比基于自然语言推断和语义文本相似性的方法分别提升了28%和27%。

Conclusion: 通过增强推理能力的跨文档指称解决模型适应过程工业的需求能够有效提高换班日志的数据质量和连贯性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进当前代码生成基准中多语言覆盖不足、测试难度有限及依赖人工注释的效率问题。

Method: 通过AutoCodeGen自动方法生成高难度的多语言代码生成数据集。此方法利用反向生成问题、多级过滤及LLMs生成测试用例，并在多语言沙箱中验证其正确性和完整性。

Result: 创建了AutoCodeBench基准数据集，涵盖3,920个问题，分布均匀于20种编程语言。对30多种开源及专有LLMs进行了评价，结果显示先进模型在多语言复杂任务中仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench可作为社区探索多语言代码生成的有力工具和研究基准，特别是在复杂和实际的场景中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

Motivation: 提高对僧伽罗语这种低资源语言的支持，为其提供开放源码的大型语言模型。

Method: 通过改进LLM的分词器以适配僧伽罗语词汇，并利用1000万清理后的僧伽罗语语料库进行持续训练，开发了SinLlama模型。

Result: SinLlama经过指令微调后，在三个文本分类任务中显著优于Llama-3-8B的基准和指令版本。

Conclusion: 这是第一个明确支持僧伽罗语的解码器型开放源码LLM模型，表现出色。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source
Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing
multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM
tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OdysseyBench的综合性基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）代理在各种长时间、多步骤工作流中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要聚焦于独立、原子化任务，难以评估LLM在长时间上下文依赖和复杂多交互任务中的能力。

Method: 提出了OdysseyBench基准，包括OdysseyBench+（来自真实用例的300个任务）和OdysseyBench-Neo（302个新合成复杂任务），并开发了HomerAgents框架，用于自动生成长时间工作流任务和对话。

Result: 通过广泛的评估，证明OdysseyBench比现有基准更能准确评估LLM在复杂真实场景中的能力表现。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench为推动LLM代理在真实生产力场景中的发展和评估提供了重要资源，同时公开了基准及框架以支持相关研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前LLMs在应对包含复杂逻辑结构的自然语言指令时的表现，以评估其实际能力。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，通过代码函数生成包含复杂逻辑的可验证指令；进一步构建包含426条逻辑指令的LogicIFEval基准测试，以评估LLMs性能。

Result: 实验显示，当前先进的LLMs在LogicIFEval测试中的表现不佳，平均仅能正确执行不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs在复杂逻辑指令理解和执行方面存在不足，需要进一步改进以提升其实用性。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法以利用扩散大语言模型(dLLM)生成过程中的时间一致性，从而改善其文本生成的稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的dLLM解码策略仅关注最终输出，忽视了迭代去噪过程中的中间预测信息，作者观察到这种过程中存在正确答案被覆盖的时间震荡现象。

Method: 1) 提出了时间自一致性投票策略，通过聚合多个中间去噪预测的结果选出最一致的输出；2) 设计了时间一致性强化方法，通过引入时间语义熵(TSE)作为奖励信号，激励模型生成更稳定的结果。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试中，这些方法显著改善了性能。例如，仅使用负TSE奖励，就在Countdown数据集上提高24.7%的性能；与精度奖励结合时，在多个任务上取得了2%-25%的绝对精度提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明dLLM的时间动态性具有未被充分开发的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的方法展示如何利用这些特性以改进模型表现。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

TL;DR: 本文提出采用拓扑理论设计新型类别生成式人工智能（GAIA）架构，探索基于LLM范畴的普遍性质构建LLM的新型组合结构，并验证了范畴的若干理论性质如（余）完备性和拓扑性质。


<details>

Motivation: 当前LLM研究主要关注线性架构或专家混合模型，而本文意图通过拓扑理论探索运用普遍性质设计新型LLM架构。

Method: 基于Transformer模型作为序列到序列函数逼近器的理论结果，使用范畴理论中的普遍构造如（余）极限、指数对象等定义新的组合结构，并理论验证LLM范畴的（余）完备性和拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴的（余）完备性和其构成类别为拓扑结构，并提出了一种基于范函性质实现的新型LLM架构。

Conclusion: 基于拓扑理论构建了新型LLM架构，理论上验证了其可行性，为LLM设计提供了新的可能性方向。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

Motivation: 为了解决复杂因果图的推断和干预建模问题，本文提出利用拓扑范畴固有的数学性质（如(co)极限、子对象分类器、指数对象等）来构建因果模型。

Method: 基于拓扑范畴理论，引用(co)极限来求解因果图模型，使用子对象分类器对干预操作进行范畴化定义，并通过指数对象处理因果模型间的操作等价类。

Result: 证明了拓扑范畴因果模型（TCMs）具有(co)完全性，任意因果模型可以通过(co)极限得到对应近似解；提出了用自然变换量化近似质量，并展示了干预建模方法以及内禀逻辑的应用。

Conclusion: 拓扑范畴因果模型提供了一种新的理论框架，支持从理论推导到应用的因果推理和干预，尤其适用于处理复杂因果结构的情况。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

Conclusion: 结合了多目标算法的有效性与目标规划的效率，该方法在具有相似适应度景观的场景下能找到良好的折中解决方案。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Method: 提出LLM-BI (大语言模型驱动的贝叶斯推断)框架，并通过两个实验进行验证：实验1展示LLM从自然语言中提取先验分布的能力；实验2展示LLM从高层次的问题描述中指定完整模型结构的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM能够自动化贝叶斯建模的关键步骤，包括先验分布的提取和模型结构的指定。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了使用LLM自动化贝叶斯推断流程的潜力，为概率编程的全自动推断管道奠定了基础。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

### [139] [First Ask Then Answer: A Framework Design for AI Dialogue Based on Supplementary Questioning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08308)
*Chuanruo Fu,Yuncheng Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的人机交互范式FATA，通过引导LLMs先向用户提问，再生成答案，从而提高响应质量和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在用户提供信息不完整或不明确时难以生成准确和可操作的回答。

Method: 设计了FATA交互模式，首先由LLMs生成多维度补充问题，整合用户提供的补充信息后生成更高质量的答案。FATA采用单轮问题生成，强调用户参与和问题完整性。

Result: 实验结果表明，FATA在多个指标上比B-Prompt提升约40%，稳定性也优于C-Prompt。

Conclusion: FATA通过启发用户表达，帮助非专业用户制定更全面的查询，大幅优化LLMs的响应效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于知识图谱（KG）的知识增强生成（RAG），并通过提出新的评价基准和协议，研究其在知识不完整情况下的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对于KG-RAG方法的评价存在缺陷，主要表现在很多基准测试包含可以直接用知识图谱回答的问题，同时评价指标和答案匹配标准不够一致，这导致了对模型推理能力的不足评估。

Method: 该研究提出了一种通用方法，用于在知识不完整的条件下系统性地构造基准和评价KG-RAG方法。同时定义了详细的评估协议以克服现有方法的局限性。

Result: 试验结果表明，目前的KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，很多时候依赖于内部记忆，并且其泛化能力因设计不同而有所差异。

Conclusion: 在知识不完整的情况下，现有KG-RAG模型的推理效果并不理想，需要更好的建模方法和评价标准来推动这项研究。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出UrzaGPT，一个针对《万智牌：旅法师对决》实时选卡决策的领域适应大型语言模型，通过微调数据显示此方法的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在选牌及游戏任务上的表现远不及人类，研究旨在提升AI在部分可见性与动态决策环境下的能力。

Method: 利用大语言模型的语言建模能力，通过低秩适应微调技术和注释选牌记录数据集对模型进行领域适配。

Result: 未调整的小型模型表现较差，而经过UrzaGPT微调的小模型，用1万步训练达到了66.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 使用大语言模型可以实现高效、通用且易更新的选牌AI，尽管尚未超越领域特定模型，但展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了以MAB为基础的MCTS在经典规划中的高效实现，并提出了两种改进机制来提高性能：双层修改和树坍缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究提升MCTS在经典规划中效率的问题，尤其是针对节点选择耗时显著的问题。

Method: 提出一种双层修改算法，使得每个叶节点都通过预算扩展的最好优先搜索运行。此外，引入了一种树坍缩机制，减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 所提出的双层改进的MCTS方法能实现摊销的$O(1)$运行时间，与传统基于队列的OPEN列表效果类似，同时树坍缩提升了性能。

Conclusion: 改进实现显著降低了MCTS的节点选择时间复杂度，并为经典规划中的效率提升做出了贡献。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种改进的方法，通过使用求解器避免了完全枚举，从而加速约束建模语言的编译过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束建模语言在编译时需要展开所有变量组合，其中大部分组合最终是无关的，这种方法效率较低。

Method: 利用求解器仅计算生成最终约束集所需的组合，而无需全面枚举所有可能的组合。

Result: 生成的模型与传统展开方式一致，但编译速度显著加快。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了将高阶用户模型翻译为求解器可用形式的效率，特别在变量范围较大且包含选择性先决条件时表现优势。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

### [144] [OverFill: Two-Stage Models for Efficient Language Model Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08446)
*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为OverFill的新方法，通过解耦预填充和解码阶段来优化精度与效率的权衡，显著提高了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多种任务中表现出色，但高推理成本成为了部署的主要挑战，特别是在处理长序列时的解码阶段。

Method: OverFill方法将推理过程中的预填充阶段和解码阶段分离，采用全模型进行预填充，随后切换为稠密剪枝模型逐步生成标记，从而平衡计算能力与效率。

Result: 3B到1B和8B到3B的OverFill配置分别在标准基准测试中比对应剪枝模型平均提升83.2%和79.2%，并且表现与从头开始训练的相同规模模型相当，但使用了显著更少的训练数据。

Conclusion: OverFill优化了解码和推理性能，在降低训练和推理成本的同时，保障了出色的生成质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

TL;DR: TA-TSP扩展了经典旅行商问题，加入动态弧成本，采用基于GRASP的元启发式算法并结合多邻域局部搜索，取得优秀的计算性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决带有状态依赖的弧成本问题，提出TA-TSP以模拟如仓库紧凑性存储系统的场景。

Method: 使用混合整数规划技术将TA-TSP转化为一系列定制的TSP实例，结合多建构启发式算法和包括2-Opt等操作的局部搜索优化算法。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例中，在限定60秒内平均达到0.77%和0.40%的最优间隙，优于同限制下Gurobi求解器11.3%的结果。

Conclusion: 算法性能优秀，在动态弧成本问题上具有实际应用前景，并在MESS 2024竞赛中取得前三名。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

### [146] [Beyond Ordinal Preferences: Why Alignment Needs Cardinal Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08486)
*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出，现有的大模型对齐技术存在局限性，因为它们依赖于仅包含二元或顺序数据的偏好目标优化。作者证明，仅依赖此类数据不足以系统性地选择最优模型，并主张引入基于数值反馈的新方法，并公开了一个包含25,000条数值判断的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好优化方法虽然聚焦于提高标签质量或缓解偏差，但依然无法通过仅凭顺序数据来全面反映对模型的偏好。提出更有效的方法以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种新方法，采用从实验经济学中借鉴的意愿支付（willingness-to-pay）技术来收集和整合数值反馈数据，并利用该数据进行偏好微调。

Result: 实验证明，结合数值反馈的模型在实现高效优化上比仅依赖顺序数据的模型方法更优，尤其在下游基准（如Arena-Hard）中表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过引入数值反馈并公开相关数据集，该体制能更准确地区分模型偏好，解决了仅依赖顺序数据无法解决的模型选择难题。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: POMO+在解决组合问题方面表现卓越，希望这项研究能推动相关领域进一步发展。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Result: 通过对多个本体对齐任务的大量评估，验证了LLM的可行性并探讨了其性能表现。

Conclusion: LLM可以充当领域专家的替代者，在部分本体对齐任务中表现不错，但具体性能依赖于任务及模型选择。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

TL;DR: 本文提出GVGAI-LLM，一个基于视频游戏的基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理和解决问题能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估基准主要针对传统自然语言处理任务，缺乏对空间推理和规划能力的全面评估需求。

Method: 基准以General Video Game AI框架为基础，通过ASCII字符表示游戏场景，并定义了一系列新颖的评价指标，如有意义的步比、步效率和总体得分。通过零样本评估测试模型在不同复杂度游戏中的性能。

Result: 结果表明，当前LLMs在空间推理和基础规划方面存在显著限制，尽管结构化提示和空间定位方法带来了一些改进，但总体表现仍远未达到理想水平。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为研究语言模型能力提供了一个可重复的测试平台，特别关注其在代理行为和上下文推理方面的表现。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

Motivation: 解决医疗数据访问受隐私法规限制的问题，同时应对生成真实、临床有效及隐私保护记录的难题。

Method: 提出SynLLM框架，利用结构化提示和20种LLM（如LLaMA、Mistral和GPT变体）生成数据。设计了四种不同的提示类型并开发了全面的评价管道。

Result: 在“三个公共医疗数据集（如糖尿病、肝硬化和中风）”上的实验表明，提示设计显著影响数据质量和隐私风险，规则型提示效果最佳。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明在设计良好的提示及多指标评价的指导下，LLMs能生成既符合临床要求又保护隐私的合成医疗数据，为健康研究数据共享提供了新契机。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Conclusion: UGM2N实现了高效网格适应，同时克服了传统方法的限制，具备较强的推广性、稳定性和灵活性。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

TL;DR: AgriGPT是一个专为农业设计的大语言模型生态系统，结合高质量数据集和增强检索生成机制，显著提升了农业领域的推理与适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏领域专用模型、数据集和评估框架，农业领域对大语言模型的应用受限。

Method: 设计AgriGPT生态系统，包括多代理扩展数据引擎（生成Agri-342K数据集）、三通道检索增强生成框架（Tri-RAG）以及农业专用基准套件（AgriBench-13K）。

Result: AgriGPT在领域适应性和推理任务上明显优于通用大模型，为农业领域提供强大的支持。

Conclusion: AgriGPT不仅是一个农业特化语言模型，还提供了通用的开发框架，以支持科学与行业的特化语言模型开发，特别促进了欠发达地区的开源研究。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to

*HuanYu Yang,Fengming Zhu,YangFan Wu,Jianmin Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出通过选取Herbrand宇宙的子集（称为diminution），显著减少ASP问题中的grounding时间和文件大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因Herbrand宇宙规模过大而导致ASP求解效率低的问题，避免依赖常规的经验性策略。

Method: 提出了diminution的正规定义，通过特定编码评估候选子集，并通过领域谓词与现有grounder无缝集成，提高求解效率。

Result: 实验表明，在五项基准测试中，实验策略平均将grounding时间减少70%，grounding文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution策略是一种通用且稳健的方法，可有效缓解ASP中的grounding瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对电子健康记录(EHR)的个性化、在线且成本感知的特征选择框架，旨在提高诊断效率和资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法难以应对EHR数据的稀疏性、多模态性以及患者特异性变化和成本影响的问题。

Method: 设计了一个在线和成本感知的特征选择框架，按个体患者逐步获取特征，考虑预算限制和特征成本。

Result: 框架在管理稀疏、多模态数据方面表现出强大的适应性与扩展性，可用于多样化的医疗场景。

Conclusion: 该框架可以支持临床决策，帮助医生在预算限制下获取最具信息量的特征，提高诊断的信心并优化资源利用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为Prompt-and-Check的方法，通过使用轻量级开源大语言模型（LLMs）来评估模拟训练中的程序沟通合规性，且无需专门任务训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域中，程序沟通合规性评估是反映操作能力的重要指标，但现有方法通常资源密集且用户不友好，因此需要一种高效且易部署的解决方案。

Method: 采用Prompt-and-Check方法，借助语境丰富的提示语，将协议中的检查项与转录的实时对话内容进行匹配评估，并通过LLMs模型（如Llama 2 7B等）输出合规性判断。实验使用消费级GPU (RTX 4070) 进行本地运行。

Result: 通过比较模型输出与专家标注的真实数据，使用分类准确率和一致性评分评估效果。实验结果表明，基于提示的推理在无需任务特定训练的情况下能够实现高效的上下文推理。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLMs在改进训练环境中的复盘、性能反馈和自动化评估中的实际应用潜力，为大规模实用部署提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效改进了CVRP求解方案，尤其在大规模问题上具有扩展性且无需重新训练。

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong
open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through
best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with
group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies
such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both
in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K)
benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency,
while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release
Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了STELAR-Vision，一个提高多模态任务推理性能的训练框架，结合改进的数据管道与学习策略显著提升了模型的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视角语言模型在复杂多模态任务中表现受限，过度依赖链式推理，忽视了对树或图等拓扑结构的应用需求。

Method: 引入STELAR-Vision训练框架，包括利用TopoAug合成数据管道，结合监督微调与强化学习进行后训练，并提出Frugal Learning以减少输出长度。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H基准上，STELAR-Vision相较基础模型提高了9.7%的准确性，并超越更大模型Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct 7.3%。在五个OOD基准测试中，相较其他先进模型提升了高达28.4%的性能。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知的推理框架与高效学习策略，兼顾准确性和效率，显著提高了视觉语言模型在多模态任务中的表现，展示了极强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个基于LLM的社会代理通用框架，结合社会认知理论的动机、行动规划和学习模块，实验表明该框架生成的行为更贴近人类行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的社会代理通常根据特定场景设计，缺乏统一的框架，难以在不同社会情境中拓展和生成一致的行为。

Method: 提出一个基于社会认知理论的框架，设计包括动机、行为规划和学习三大模块，使代理能够合理推导目标、规划行动、调整行为。

Result: 实验表明，新框架的社会代理行为与真实世界行为数据的偏差降低了75%，去除任一模块的研究显示模型行为误差增加1.5至3.2倍，验证了各模块的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计更真实一致的社会行为提供了系统方法，与传统生成模型相比具有显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了增强现实（AR）与多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的整合，提出一种记忆增强型AR代理框架，用于实现个性化的任务辅助，解决当前AR代理对复杂场景适应性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR系统和基础模型结合的应用在单一步骤任务中表现良好，但由于无法在时空上下文中捕获和利用用户的历史交互信息，因此在处理多步骤复杂场景时存在局限性。

Method: 研究提出了一个包含四个模块的记忆增强型AR代理框架，包括（1）感知模块，用于多模态的传感器信息处理；（2）记忆模块，用于存储时空体验；（3）时空推理模块，用于综合过去和当前情境；（4）执行模块，用于高效的AR反馈交流。

Result: 通过构建概念框架，提供实施路线图、未来评估策略以及适用领域案例，为开发更加智能的AR系统提供了理论与实践依据。

Conclusion: 该框架可实现从用户历史交互中学习并适应个性化体验的能力，激励了在上下文感知的任务辅助方面更智能的AR系统的研究可能性。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

TL;DR: 文章探讨了大语言模型知识编辑的方法，并提出了基于功能的新分类体系，以更全面地评估现有方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型中存储的知识易过时且再训练成本高，文章旨在探索一种更有效的知识编辑方法，以更新信息，同时保留模型的整体能力。

Method: 文章提出了一种基于知识功能的新分类体系，并分析了不同编辑机制在各种知识类型中的有效性，包括事实性、时态性、概念性、常识性和社会性知识的编辑。

Result: 基于功能的分类体系揭示了现有方法的优劣，并定义了问题框架，同时整理了评估任务、数据集及总结未来挑战方向。

Conclusion: 文章为大语言模型知识编辑领域提供了新视角，强调编辑机制与知识功能的匹配性，并指出了未来可能解决的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的软件资源GRainsaCK，用于评估知识图谱预测的解释性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱中的链接预测方法常缺乏解释性，当前也缺少统一的评估协议来标准化比较这些方法带来的解释。

Method: 提出了一种名为GRainsaCK的软件，能够标准化整个从模型训练到解释评估的流程，并提供模块化和拓展性设计。

Result: GRainsaCK 提供了一种可重复使用的资源，确保不同链接预测方法解释性的严格评估，附有详细文档和教程以助于推广使用。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了解释性评估工具的空白，支持未来在知识图谱研究领域的应用和发展。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为E-Agent的框架，通过改进mRAG的规划和检索方式，提升多模态大语言模型在实际场景中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态生成增强检索方法（mRAG）因僵化的检索策略和对视觉信息的利用不足，在处理动态新闻分析和趋势话题等实际应用中表现有限。

Method: 提出E-Agent框架，包括基于上下文推理的动态多模态工具规划器和工具感知的任务执行器，并设计了一个新的评估基准RemPlan来评估mRAG的规划能力。

Result: E-Agent在RemPlan和三个已有基准测试中性能优越，与最先进的mRAG方法相比，准确率提高13%，同时减少了37%的冗余搜索。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过高效的工具规划和动态决策，显著改善了现有mRAG方法的性能和效率，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI，尤其是多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情绪识别能力，评估其是否能超过人类专家，并研究AI与人类协作的潜力。

Method: 使用Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test（RMET）及其多种族版本（MRMET）评估MLLMs的情绪识别能力，并与人类参与者的表现进行对比，包括模拟人类集体决策和协作方法。

Result: MLLMs平均在情绪识别上表现优于个体，但人类集体智慧显著胜过单独MLLMs的预测。同时，人类和MLLMs相结合的协作方法达到了超越任何单一群体的高准确率。

Conclusion: MLLMs在情绪识别上的表现出色，但结合人类集体智慧与人类-AI协作提供了更优化的发展方向，有助于实现更有效的情绪智能系统发展。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个双代理混合框架来增强数学推理系统，将推理解题和代码生成执行分开，以降低认知负荷并改善协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统容易因单代理模式的认知负荷干扰而无法有效协调推理与程序生成任务。

Method: 提出了一种双代理框架，其中推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理负责代码生成与执行。训练通过模仿学习和强化学习结合完成。

Result: 验证显示双代理模型能够减少认知负荷且稳定有效地协调推理与代码生成。

Conclusion: 双代理设计提升了推理路径正确性，并改善了整体推理与编码任务的协同，具有普遍应用潜力。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对视觉语言模型因多模态输入隐性推理缺陷引发的安全问题。

Method: 开发名为SSUI的数据集，并展示简单双环境学习方法能减轻隐性多模态威胁。

Result: 通过SSUI数据集展示，上下文学习可以显著缓解隐性多模态威胁问题。

Conclusion: 证明了改进跨模态隐性推理是解决LVLM安全问题的迫切需求。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

*Rui Wang,Qihan Lin,Jiayu Liu,Qing Zong,Tianshi Zheng,Weiqi Wang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论（PT）是否适用于大型语言模型（LLMs），以及表达人类不确定性的认知标记是否会影响LLMs的决策行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的在于填补现有研究中的空白，包括PT是否能解释LLMs的决策行为，以及语言中表达不确定性的标记对决策行为的影响。

Method: 设计了基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，建立了更广泛和精确的评估框架，通过认知标记的概率实值引入不确定性，并检验这些标记对LLMs决策行为的影响。

Result: 发现基于PT建模LLMs决策行为并不总是可靠，尤其当不确定性通过多样化的语言形式表达时。

Conclusion: 表达人类不确定性的语言特征对LLMs的决策行为具有重要影响，但现有的PT框架在解释这些行为方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Intrinsic Memory Agents的框架，解决大型语言模型多智能体系统中的记忆一致性、角色遵循和程序完整性问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型的多智能体系统在复杂协作任务中展现出潜力，但受限于上下文窗口，存在记忆一致性、角色遵循和任务完整性受损等问题，需要新的方法来解决这些限制。

Method: 通过引入结构化的特定智能体记忆，并且随着智能体输出进行内在驱动的进化，设计一个保持角色对齐的记忆模板，专注于任务相关信息。

Result: 在PDDL数据集上，与现有最先进的多智能体记忆方法相比，性能提升38.6%，同时实现最高的token效率。此外，在复杂数据管道设计任务中，评价了5个指标并显示设计质量的提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化和内在方法解决记忆局限性，可以提升多智能体LLM系统在结构化规划任务中的能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

### [170] [Activation Steering for Bias Mitigation: An Interpretable Approach to Safer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09019)
*Shivam Dubey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端系统，通过模型内部机制的解释性技术识别并减轻语言模型中偏见的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多以数据过滤或输出后处理为主，将模型视作黑箱，难以从根本上解决偏见问题。

Method: 利用线性探针识别模型内部潜在的偏见表示，并通过对比生成‘引导向量’，实时调整模型生成的内容。

Result: 实验中，这种方法在准确识别偏见和实时调整生成内容方面表现良好，特别是偏见在模型后期层中最为显著。

Conclusion: 通过从模型机制上直接干预，该方法提供了一种更可解释且可复制的方式来减少语言模型中的偏见，为安全可靠的LLM开发提供支持。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种新的预测方法，用于在乘客未提交叫车请求的条件下预测其等待时间，提出了FiXGBoost模型并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善共享出行用户体验和平台效率，同时为乘客提供更好的出行时间规划工具。

Method: 基于海量实际出行数据，进行了需求与供给动态关系分析，开发了基于特征交互的XGBoost模型FiXGBoost，用于无驾驶员匹配信息场景下的等待时间预测。

Result: 实验表明，FiXGBoost模型在大规模真实数据（包含3000万次行程记录）上表现优异，并具备高度可解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost模型为乘客等待时间的预测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，在提升共享出行服务体验方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种利用深度神经网络的预测性维护框架，用于早期检测铁路轨道电路中的异常，并成功验证其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法早期检测轨道电路中细微的信号异常，从而影响维护规划和运营可靠性，因此需要一种更高效、精准的异常分类与预测方法。

Method: 通过深度神经网络建立预测性维护框架，可在异常发展为故障之前对其进行分类，并结合符合ISO-17359标准的验证与一致性置信区间分析。

Result: 实验验证了在10个CVCM故障案例中，提出的方法比传统技术表现更优，整体准确率达到99.31%，且在异常出现1%的范围内完成检测，提供了高置信度的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅具有极高的检测精度和早期识别能力，还具备可扩展性和适应性，可广泛应用于全球轨道电路和铁路系统中，提升运营可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在隐私泄露的归因责任上存在挑战，尤其是无法可靠地将生成的内容归因于预训练、外部检索或用户输入。

Method: 设计了SMA方法，包括基于零阶优化的归因估算机制和跨模态归因技术，支持从图像到文本的精确归因。

Result: 实验验证了SMA方法能够在复杂生成系统中实现精确的来源归因，填补了多模态系统中图像检索追踪的盲点。

Conclusion: SMA方法转变了会员推测的关注点，从是否记忆数据转向内容来源识别，为大型生成系统的数据来源审计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

TL;DR: Vision-language模型如今具备自动化多样化电脑任务的能力，但许多关键细节仍处于封闭状态。本文提出了一个名为OpenCUA的开源框架，包括数据注释工具、大规模任务数据集和可扩展的状态-动作转换流水线，实现了在CUA基准任务上的强劲表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Vision-language模型日益成为重要的计算机任务代理，其在研究界需要开放框架来研究其能力、局限性和风险。同时，目前最强大的CUA系统仍保持封闭状态，限制了研究的发展。

Method: 提出了OpenCUA框架，包括(1)人类电脑使用演示的注释基础设施；(2)覆盖三种操作系统、200+应用/网站的大规模任务数据集AgentNet；(3)基于“连锁思维”的扩展性能转换流水线。

Result: 构建的模型在CUA基准任务上表现优越，OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified基准上的成功率为34.8%，超越现有开源模型以及OpenAI的CUA系统（GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: OpenCUA框架为CUA研究创建了开放基础，确保其在不同领域通用性强且随着测试时计算能力提升表现提高。研究团队公开工具、数据集、代码和模型，鼓励领域发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

TL;DR: 提出BrowseMaster框架，通过规划者和执行者的分工协作，改进大规模语言模型在复杂信息检索任务中的表现，在多个基准上优于当前模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大规模语言模型在信息检索中因搜索范围有限和推理不足而表现不佳。

Method: 设计了BrowseMaster框架，由规划者制定搜索策略，执行者进行高效检索，并通过分工协作实现宽广且系统的探索。

Result: 在BrowseComp-en和BrowseComp-zh实验中分别获得30.0和46.5的成绩，优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂推理和信息检索任务中表现出色，是目前相关任务的领先解决方案之一。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Motivation: 现有基于大规模预训练的方法在复杂临床工作流的多步骤处理和任务协调上存在不足，研究需开发能支持灵活指令解析和工具整合的AI系统。

Method: 设计了EndoAgent，它基于双存储机制，通过短期动作追踪和长期经验学习结合，集成了一套专家设计的工具，支持多任务处理。并提出了EndoAgentBench作为基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，EndoAgent在多个任务中优于通用和医学多模态模型，展现了较强的灵活性和推理能力。

Conclusion: EndoAgent的设计理念和实验结果表明，其能有效应对内窥镜分析的复杂需求，具有广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型通常需要大量参数和训练资源，不够高效，因此亟需新的方法来改进训练效率和模型性能。

Method: 利用遗传算法识别随机初始化的过参数化网络中未经训练即可匹配原模型精度的强彩票子网络，避免了高昂的参数更新过程。

Result: 实验发现，对于二元与多类分类任务，该方法较现有最优方法在精度和稀疏性上表现更优，无需梯度信息。

Conclusion: 遗传算法可有效识别强彩票子网络，为构建高效深度学习系统提供了新思路，同时说明复杂网络架构和学习任务需适当调整评估指标。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理编码中表现出高效性和准确性，具有成本效益，为大规模地理参照提供了强有力的可能性。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical

Conclusion: 针对边缘计算系统，Hat-DFed有效解决了动态拓扑和数据异构性对分布式联邦学习的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

TL;DR: XFMNet是一种专为水质长期时间序列预测设计的多模态融合网络，显示了其在捕捉长期趋势和短期波动方面的显著性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因受复杂周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引发的突发波动影响，一直是一个具有挑战性的问题，尤其在需要同时建模时间和空间动态的多站点场景中。

Method: XFMNet通过一种分步多模态融合网络解决水质预测问题，方法包括自适应下采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解趋势与周期成分，交叉注意力门控融合模块动态结合时空和生态线索，递进且递归地进行多模态融合以捕捉趋势与波动。

Result: 实验显示，XFMNet在真实数据集上优于当前最先进的模型，在空间分布式时间序列预测方面的表现有显著提升。

Conclusion: XFMNet是一种能够整合多模态信息的有效水质预测方法，具有更强的鲁棒性和预测能力。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为MoSSDA的两步动量编码器框架，用于处理多变量时间序列分类中的半监督领域自适应问题，在六个数据集上实现了最先进的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在训练和测试数据分布不同（领域偏移）时性能会下降，因此需要能够处理领域偏移的解决方案。本文专注于为噪声敏感的时间序列数据开发半监督领域自适应方法。

Method: 提出MoSSDA框架，包括使用领域不变编码器学习源域和目标域特征，以及基于混合增强的正对比模块进行特征学习，同时采用两阶段学习过程来分离编码器和分类器的梯度流，以提升特征丰富性和表征能力。

Result: 在六个数据集上，MoSSDA在三种不同骨干网络和不同未标注数据比例中均实现了最先进的表现。

Conclusion: MoSSDA框架可以获得鲁棒、领域不变和类别判别性的特征表征，且各模块均对性能提升有显著贡献。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过从电信数据中挖掘知识优化流量调度和资源分配，但现阶段对流量特性的复杂性和预测中的概念漂移问题研究不足。

Method: 提出MGSTC方法，采用粗粒度时间注意力捕获趋势，细粒度空间注意力进行局部细化与互补，并通过在线学习策略进行实时概念漂移检测及参数调整。

Conclusion: MGSTC在应对蜂窝流量难点如流量性质复杂性及概念漂移问题上表现出优势，能够在实际连续预测中实现高精度。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer架构改变了AI领域，但相关的计算原理仍不清晰。作者希望探索注意力机制的基础计算法则。

Method: 通过将注意力机制的关键组件（queries, keys, values）映射到经典条件反射的元素，建立了与线性注意力相对应的数学模型，并分析其能力和限制。

Result: 提出了一些理论结果，如注意力头的存储容量与干扰关系的定理，误差传播分析，以及如何通过生物启发的学习规则提升Transformer架构。

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功不仅仅来源于架构的新颖性，而是可能得到数百万年进化优化的计算原则启发。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在高光谱成像中，通常仅提供单一物质类型的预测，且局限于训练数据集的范围，缺乏解释性和泛化性。

Method: 采用概率潜变量模型学习高光谱辐射测量分布，结合物理相关条件如大气和背景估计信息，通过编码-解码流程和物理损失标准进行训练，利用条件后验分布进行Monte-Carlo采样，同时引入基于分布的材料匹配方案。

Conclusion: 该方法综合了高光谱场景的上下文信息，并利用物理一致性和分布匹配的方法，为物质识别提供了一种更为通用和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Conclusion: 统计方法更适合已知或经良好建模的光谱特征，而机器学习对不确定条件下的识别更为稳健。在定量分析中，统计方法效果更佳。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Motivation: 为了解决GNN在深层网络中特征过平滑的问题，并优化分层特征的提取和融合，尤其是当前方法在深层特征处理上的不足。

Method: 提出Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net)框架，由两大模块组成：1. Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)模块，动态采用cross-attention和Graph-Mamba投影器，适应不同层深特征；2. Source-Aware Fusion (SAF)模块，根据特征聚合特点进行自适应融合，优化最终特征表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，HSA-Net框架在定量和定性评估上均优于当前最新的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了有效的分层特征投影与融合解决方案，缓解了GNN的过平滑瓶颈，提高了分子表示学习的效果。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习框架无法充分考虑边缘设备的计算异构性和训练负担，以及高通信成本和复杂的模型聚合问题。

Method: 提出SHeRL-FL，通过整合分割学习(SL)和分层模型聚合，将表示学习引入中间层，同时允许客户端与边缘服务器独立于云端计算训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，相较于集中式FL和HierFL，SHeRL-FL降低了超过90%的数据传输量，相较于SplitFed降低了50%的数据传输量，并改进了分层分割学习方法。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL在降低通信成本和优化性能方面表现出色，是解决大规模网络中联邦学习挑战的一种高效方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Tsetlin机器采用“全有或全无”子句评估方法，需大量子句才能保证精度，资源消耗大。提出改进方法来提高效率与性能。

Method: 引入模糊模式评估机制，当子句部分失效时，其余部分仍能按比例贡献分数，从而实现高效灵活的模式匹配。

Result: FPTM在各种数据集上显著减少了子句数量和训练时间，同时提高了分类准确度。例如，在IMDb数据集上仅用1个子句每类别即可实现90.15%准确率，与标准方法相比减少了50倍内存，训练速度加快至316倍。

Conclusion: FPTM通过模糊评估机制提升了资源利用率和准确度，展现出在低资源环境中部署学习算法的潜力。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

Motivation: 以往缩放点积注意力机制的形式通常是基于启发式的，本研究旨在从一阶原理提供其数学基础。

Method: 证明正向传播是一个退化的单边熵最优传输问题的解决方案，并揭示其反向传播等价于强化学习中的优势策略梯度更新规则。

Conclusion: 从理论上统一了正向传播与反向传播过程，通过信息几何使得缩放点积注意力机制成为一种有原则的最优推断与学习更新机制。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

Conclusion: 当线下数据丰富且高质量时，OOPE算法的性能比传统纯在线方法更优，充分利用数据的探索维度对算法效果影响显著，提供了实用与理论结合的重大进展。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为DCCD-CONF的新方法，在存在未测量混杂变量的情况下，通过干预数据学习非线性循环因果图，实验表明其效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现算法假设所有变量可观测或因果图无向性，但这些假设在实际中往往难以满足，尤其是在生物网络等系统中；现有处理混杂变量的方法也存在局限性。

Method: 提出一种称为DCCD-CONF的框架，通过最大化数据对数似然交替优化图结构和混杂变量分布估计，并通过可微分的方式学习非线性循环因果图。

Result: 通过对合成数据和基因干预数据集的实验，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂变量识别上均优于目前先进方法。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF为学习存在混杂变量的复杂因果图提供了一种理论上可验证且效果优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 现有异构图神经网络（HGNNs）虽性能优越，预测过程却缺乏透明性。现有后验解释方法对实际节点特征缺乏支持，导致解释不够现实且不忠实。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer改进了解释的真实性与忠实性，为异构图神经网络的可解释性研究提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的局部最优传输（POT）方法常依赖于熵正则化，返回稠密的传输计划，而许多应用需要稀疏化的结果，因此需要一种新的方法来改进。

Method: 提出了一种基于二次正则化的POT公式，称为QPOT，通过引入稀疏性来改进传输计划，以适应需要稀疏性的应用。

Conclusion: QPOT有效实现了稀疏化的局部最优传输计划，在多个领域应用中表现优秀，解决了熵正则化方法的局限性。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Conclusion: 该方法是一种基本的并行策略，可扩展应用于云平台和多节点高性能计算集群等多种异构环境。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: SHEFL框架可以有效解决因客户资源多样性而导致的联邦学习收敛问题，在提高模型公平性和性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Conclusion: 动态秩训练是一种通用方法，可以在多种神经网络任务中应用，解决低秩结构带来的秩塌陷问题，同时保持高效的计算性能。

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Motivation: 传统的大语言模型在黑箱优化任务中存在探索新的解空间和利用高回报解之间的平衡问题。最近流行的测试时训练（TTT）虽能提升解的质量，但依赖手工设计的训练数据，限制了跨领域的可行性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MiGrATe通过结合探索与利用，展现了在线TTT在无外部监督情况下应用于复杂搜索任务的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Result: 在三种标准OCIL数据集的实验中，新方法在多个OCIL模型及不同内存预算下都表现出显著的性能增强。

Conclusion: 通过结合GWM和多级协作蒸馏的OCIL方法成功改善了稳定性与适应性的平衡，为实际应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合专家信息与优化采样，提升了广告竞价系统中的生成能力和实际收益，为扩散模型在自动竞价中的应用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法COGS以解决现有神经网络在某些TSP分布上表现较差的问题，并通过新数据集TSPLib50验证其通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经网络求解TSP问题时在某些真实分布上糟糕的最差性能表现。

Method: 提出COGS方法，通过生成TSP数据模型采样训练数据，增强数据分布覆盖。同时，开发新数据集TSPLib50用于测试现实分布的泛化能力。

Result: COGS在多个合成和真实数据集上的表现优于现有基线方法，特别是在最差情况中的表现有显著提升。

Conclusion: COGS方法有效提高分布鲁棒性，解决了神经网络在TSP求解中分布泛化的关键问题，为复杂物流等实际应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管RF模型在生成任务中表现优异，但其离散复杂度理论分析较少或结果受限，因此需要进一步研究其理论基础和复杂度问题。

Method: 在多步生成中引入了Langevin过程作为修正器，分析并证明RF模型的多项式级别离散复杂度。对于单步生成，基于多步RF模型的观察，首次提供了其多项式离散复杂度结果。

Result: RF模型在多步和单步生成中的理论复杂度优于现有的扩散模型（如VP和VE模型）。

Conclusion: 研究首次从理论上证明了RF模型在生成任务中的优异性能，为更深层次理解其高效性奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统奖励模型缺乏解释性、推理透明性差及应对用户偏好变化能力弱的问题。

Method: 通过将LLM隐藏激活映射到稀疏单义的特征空间，并由标量头聚合特征得分以生成解释性奖励分数。

Result: SARM模型实现了特征级奖励归因，支持用户偏好动态调整，并且在对齐性能上优于传统奖励模型。

Conclusion: SARM改善了奖励模型的透明性和实用性，提升对齐效果，且代码公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法中由于伪标签确认偏差和训练崩塌引起的性能瓶颈，同时在缺乏额外信息源的情况下提高模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过预训练提取差异化决策因子，训练阶段移除矛盾样本并基于短板原则选择伪标签样本，同时加入多模态语言模型引入潜在文本知识并设计责任评分机制优化判断。

Conclusion: DiFac框架通过一致性约束和额外信息的整合，解决了半监督学习中决策因子独立性不足的问题，为低资源数据学习提供了一种有效方案。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI系统的文档模板无法全面覆盖整个生命周期，也未能完全满足《AI法》的合规要求，亟需改进。

Method: 提出了开源模板用于记录数据、模型和应用，涵盖AI生命周期，通过用户反馈改进并在实际案例中验证其效用。

Result: 模板在实用场景中得到验证，如记录皮肤色调数据集、分割人类轮廓的神经网络及施工安全实时视频分析系统。

Conclusion: TechOps模板是满足监管合规性及推动负责任AI开发的实际工具，为行业合规性和透明性提供支持。

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Motivation: 现有网络中故障报警数量繁多，而且网络节点之间存在相互关联，使得故障根源的识别变得复杂且繁重，需要一个有效的方法来学习报警之间的关系，以提高报警分析的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出了一种新型的无监督报警关系学习技术——Temporal Optimization （TempOpt），以克服现有基于时间依赖方法的局限性，通过优化报警之间的关系学习实现高效根报警识别。

Result: 通过在实际网络数据集上的实验验证，TempOpt相比于传统的时间依赖方法显著提高了报警关系学习的质量。

Conclusion: TempOpt提供了一个更实用且有效的方法去解决网络中报警关系的学习问题，有助于更快速和精确地定位网络故障的根因。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Motivation: 传统的Transformer参数量大且对非平稳特性捕捉能力有限，MLP难以处理多通道依赖问题。因此需要一种高效、轻量化的时间序列预测模型。

Method: 提出结合小波变换与MLP的WaveTS-B模型，通过在小波域内捕获周期性和非平稳特性，并利用通道聚类策略和MoE框架的WaveTS-M，处理多通道的依赖关系。

Result: 在8个实际时间序列数据集中，WaveTS系列模型显著减少了参数数量，同时实现了SOTA性能，尤其是WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上的表现尤为出色。

Conclusion: WaveTS-B和WaveTS-M有效平衡了参数量与预测性能，为多通道时间序列预测任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了生成机器学习模型在系统设计中的适用性，同时提高了质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中整合隐私数据可能导致数据质量和合规性问题，现有框架缺乏针对数据删除的机制，特别是在满足GDPR等法规要求时表现不足。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，将联邦学习与“遗忘”目标统一，使用6个联邦学习算法和5个“遗忘”算法进行评估和比较，形成全面分析流程。

Result: 实验表明，Oblivionis框架在“遗忘”效能与模型效用之间达成了良好的平衡，优于传统的本地训练方法。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦学习中的隐私数据选择性移除问题提供了可行的解决方案，同时注重合规性和信任，具有重要实践意义和指导未来发展方向的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Method: 通过优化技术借助可训练的激活函数（包括Pade函数和分段线性函数），来实现高复杂度的函数空间先验匹配，并分析其学习挑战。

Result: 实验表明，结合灵活可训练激活的单层宽隐藏层BNNs可以有效地实现函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 合理设计激活函数对实现目标的函数空间先验尤为关键，这为BNNs的不确定性建模提供了一种切实可行的方法。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Conclusion: 研究揭示了类增量学习中的潜在安全问题，并促使进一步研究更有效的防御机制。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are

*Ze Tao,Hanxuan Wang,Fujun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种名为LNN-PINN的物理信息神经网络框架，通过液体残差门控结构提升了在复杂问题中的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在复杂问题上预测精度有限，迫切需要改善其表现。

Method: 引入了液体残差门控结构，保持了原有的物理建模及优化框架，仅在隐藏层映射中加入轻量的门控机制，而采样策略、损失函数组成及超参数设置均未改变。

Result: 在四个基准问题中，LNN-PINN在相同训练条件下显著减少了RMSE和MAE，且绝对误差图验证了其准确性提升。此外，框架在不同维度、边界条件及算子特性下表现出良好的适应性和稳定性。

Conclusion: LNN-PINN通过一种简明有效的架构改进，提升了物理信息神经网络在复杂科学与工程问题中的预测准确性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是为未覆盖交通传感器的地区提供高效的交通预测，把解决缺乏历史交通观测作为关键挑战。

Method: 通过引入物理知情神经网络、外部信号学习模块（如天气与交通状态的关系）和空间分组模块来过滤局部特征，从而增强模型的推广性能。

Result: 实验表明，GenCast在多个真实数据集上均减少了预测误差，性能表现优越。

Conclusion: 通过创新方法，GenCast能够有效地预测传感器缺失区域的交通量，为智能交通系统的广泛普及提供了一种可靠方案。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

*Etienne Gael Tajeuna,Jean Marie Tshimula*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GRAVITY的框架，通过模拟物理系统中的吸引力机制来改进顶点分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过物理系统启发，希望利用顶点之间的结构相似性和属性接近性改进分类能力。

Method: 核心方法是通过一种潜在势场模型，使顶点在能量效率的位置自组织，适应性地调整顶点的感受域。

Result: 实验显示，在多个真实数据集上，GRAVITY在转导和归纳顶点分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过增强类边界和语义一致性，在图嵌入和顶点分类上提供了竞争性结果。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息对时间序列对抗攻击具有重要意义，提出的方法对时间序列预测的对抗攻击提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

*Marte Eggen,Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了注意力机制在解释模型行为方面的潜在价值，提出了两种整合注意力权重的解释方法，并通过验证展示了它们的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着注意力机制广泛应用于Transformer架构，其可解释性引起了大量研究兴趣，但目前仍缺乏有效利用注意力权重提供有意义解释的方法。

Method: 论文开发了两个新的解释方法：其一将注意力权重融入Shapley值分解，从而通过定义成对token间交互提供局部解释；其二将注意力权重结合到基于概念激活向量的方向导数中，测量全局性概念灵敏度。

Result: 实验结果表明，将注意力权重纳入XAI（可解释人工智能）框架可以为Transformer模型带来更丰富、更有意义的解释。

Conclusion: 整合注意力权重到现有解释框架中是一种有效且具有潜力的方法，有助于进一步提升Transformer模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究致力于边缘智能系统中的分层推理，提出了能够以最低带宽使用、提升准确性并减少延迟的HI-LCB和HI-LCB-lite两种策略。实际数据集验证表明其超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘智能中，本地设备和远程服务器协同推理模型的实现中，需要解决如何动态评估本地模型推理准确性的挑战。

Method: 通过建模本地模型推理正确概率为置信度的递增函数，提出基于置信上界框架的HI-LCB和HI-LCB-lite方法。

Result: 提出的方法实现了O(log T)的后悔率，与现有方法的O(T^{2/3})后悔率相比大幅提升。同时，HI-LCB-lite具有O(1)的单样本计算复杂度，适应资源受限设备。

Conclusion: HI-LCB和HI-LCB-lite策略在资源受限环境中应用效果显著，能以低复杂度和高性能应对分层推理挑战。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Conclusion: MechaFormer提供了高质量输出，可作为传统优化器的起点，显著提高解决方案效率。

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning
approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific
patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The
OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence
of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper
outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key
assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决网络数据中缺失链接预测问题，特别是在无节点属性的情况下如何选择最优算法。

Method: 本文使用550个真实网络构建一个多样化基准，比较了42个拓扑链接预测器、4种叠加算法及两种图神经网络算法的性能，并提出了一种元学习算法。

Result: 发现没有单一算法适用于所有网络；随机森林的叠加模型在大多数情况下优于图神经网络，尤其在AUC标准下表现突出。但网络特性对算法优劣影响显著。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习算法能根据网络特性选择最佳的预测算法，比现有方法性能更好且可扩展至大规模网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的评估需要大量的标记数据和计算资源，而本研究旨在通过更高效的方法降低数据和计算需求，同时确保评估的精确性。

Method: 提出以上下文学习的方式构建廉价的代理模型，用于引导数据获取，同时绕过了在主动测试循环中频繁更新模型的需求。此外，开发了单次运行的误差估计器来动态评估主动测试的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有标准方法能用更少的数据更高效地评估大语言模型的表现。

Conclusion: 研究证明了主动测试在大规模语言模型的评估上的应用潜力，通过更少的数据和计算需求实现了精准评估，可以为实际场景中的模型测试提供有效支持。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有GNN在预测手性方面的性能和方法不足，提出一种工具来生成用于测试的合成数据集，以更好地探索结构改进可能性。

Method: 设计并实现了Chi-Geometry，一个生成具有用户指定几何和拓扑特性的合成图数据库，同时随机化节点位置，使训练数据更具解释性和基准性。基于该工具生成数据以测试不同GNN模型的性能。

Result: 以Chi-Geometry生成的数据集为基准测试了几种先进GNN架构，并根据结果提出了两种新架构，一个采用全连接提升预测能力，一个通过虚拟节点实现计算效率优化。

Conclusion: 基于Chi-Geometry生成数据成功评估了不同GNN模型的表现，并通过全连接策略或虚拟节点建构分别针对性能和效率提出创新设计，为应用与研发提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

Motivation: 改善视觉语言模型在几何问题求解中的推理能力，解决其在解释图表和语言推理上的不足。

Method: 提出将链式推理（CoT）与形式语言结合的方法，同时使用新合成的数据集进行监督微调，并采用包含解算器的强化学习优化推理与生成的程序。

Conclusion: 通过高阶几何知识和将符号计算交由解算器完成，显著增强了推理效果，并对方法设计提供了深入分析，为未来研究带来启示。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨数据集的信息利用问题，尤其是在数据集异构、不一致的情况下。

Method: 提出ASPIRE模型，结合了基于集合的Transformer和语义基础模块，通过自然语言描述、元数据和上下文示例学习特征依赖关系。

Result: ASPIRE在多个基准测试上表现优秀，并支持成本感知的主动特征获取能力。

Conclusion: ASPIRE实现了开放世界的语义感知推理，是面向真正通用推理系统的重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络的可靠置信估计提供了一种实用高效的解决方案，在安全关键领域或数据复杂场景中具备重要的应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

Motivation: 解决进化方法在游戏领域中因输入状态空间和策略空间过大而导致的搜索效率低的问题。

Method: 引入了SCOPE方法，该方法使用离散余弦变换（DCT）将游戏输入状态转换为系数矩阵，通过截断和稀疏化减少输入状态空间的维度，而后采用CMA-ES算法进行优化。

Result: SCOPE方法在Atari游戏“Space Invaders”的任务中表现优异，与OpenAI-ES和HyperNEAT等传统进化方法相比实现了更好的性能，并超过了DQN和A3C等简单强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过使用SCOPE方法减少输入空间维度并优化策略训练，大幅提高了进化方法在复杂游戏状态下的学习效率。

Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning
methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses
a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large
state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of
the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal
patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more
trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.
Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as
increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with
convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a
meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state
into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this
matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the
highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE
with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input
state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple
reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result
through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a
bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by
the CMA-ES algorithm.

Motivation: 低剂量X射线虽然能减少儿童辐射暴露，但引入的噪声会损害关键解剖结构的清晰呈现，而传统去噪方法难以兼顾去噪效果与诊断细节的保留。

Method: 提出SharpXR模型，通过双解码器U-Net架构，一边采用拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器，一边使用可学习的融合模块来自适应地平衡去噪与细节呈现。同时利用模拟的Possion-Gaussian噪声数据进行模型训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上均优于现有技术，且保持了适合资源受限环境的计算效率。SharpXR去噪后图像将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR有效去噪低剂量儿科X射线图像的同时，保留了重要诊断特征，为低资源环境中的儿科诊断提供了一种可行的工具。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.
