### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual引入了一种基于Retinex理论的新框架，用于超高清图像修复，通过两种子网络的结合，更有效地解决了传统方法的信息丢失和局部退化问题，且性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超高清图像修复方法存在极端下采样导致的信息丢失及纯频域方法对局部退化失效的问题，亟需一种既能保留信息又能处理局部退化的全新方法。

Method: 提出了RetinexDual框架，采用两个互补子网络：SAMBA负责反射分量修正，通过粗到细机制减少伪影并恢复细节；FIA则通过频域操作确保颜色及光照的精准校正。

Result: 在包括去雨、去模糊、去雾及低光增强的四项超高清图像修复任务上，RetinexDual在定性和定量指标上均优于最新方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual凭借创新的设计及子网络分工，展现出在超高清图像修复任务中的强大潜力，有效验证了其理论和方法的成功。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ENTRep, 旨在提升耳鼻喉内窥镜图像分析的能力，提出了一个双语数据集和新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳鼻喉内窥镜成像分析是医疗中的一项关键但尚未充分发展的领域，现有基准缺乏可靠检索和分类功能，尤其是在区分细粒度特征和双语言描述方面。

Method: 设计了一个名为ENTRep的数据集，包含高质量专家标注的影像及其双语文本描述，定义三项基准任务，采用标准化提交协议，并通过服务器评分评估后测表现。

Result: 搭建了包含解剖分类和检索评测的基准框架，并汇报了表现卓越团队的结果及反思。

Conclusion: ENTRep提供了耳鼻喉内窥镜图像分析的新基准和工具，助力发展该领域的数据与算法能力。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种通过多种自监督学习模型联合蒸馏知识以训练紧凑学生模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自监督学习方法过于依赖独立预训练的大模型，不适合资源有限的场景。

Method: 引入Consensus-oriented Masked Distillation (CoMAD)，通过三种预训练教师模型交互并采用不对称遮掩及联合共识门控方法，训练一个小型学生模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，CoMAD模型的ViT-Tiny分类精度达到75.4%，在ADE20K和MS-COCO数据集上的密集预测任务中表现也超过现有方法。

Conclusion: CoMAD通过优化资源使用和知识整合，在自监督蒸馏领域为小型模型设立了新基准。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RADAR方法，通过注意力扩散模型在无重建的情况下直接生成异常图，实现了更高效和精准的异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的异常检测方法存在计算开销大、重建图像无法准确匹配原始输入、以及噪声水平选择困难的缺点，因此需要一种更高效准确的方法。

Method: RADAR是一种基于注意力扩散模型的异常检测方法，直接从扩散模型中生成异常图，而无需重建输入图像，从而提高效率和精度。

Result: RADAR在3D打印材料和MVTec-AD数据集上的表现优于当前最先进的方法，在精确度、召回率和F1分数等指标上均有明显提升，其中在F1分数上分别提高了7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR克服了基于重建的异常检测方法的不足，通过直接生成异常图实现了更高效精确的检测，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出一种基于事件相机的眼动追踪方法，通过CNN_LSTM模型实现81%的准确率，计划使用LRP提升模型解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在VR/AR产品中提升用户舒适度和设备性能，发展低成本、精准的眼动追踪方法。

Method: 利用事件相机输入，通过深度学习尤其是CNN_LSTM模型预测眼睛中心位置。

Result: CNN_LSTM模型实现了约81%的眼动追踪准确率。

Conclusion: 此研究解决了传统方法成本高的问题，为眼动追踪建模提供了高效可解释的方向，并计划引入LRP进一步提升模型性能和解释性。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LuKAN模型，以高效预测3D人体动作，通过时间序列编码和Lucas多项式的Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks结合实现准确性和计算效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体动作预测方法在准确性与计算效率之间难以平衡，因此有必要发展更高效的预测方法。

Method: 提出LuKAN模型，利用离散小波变换编码时间信息，通过空间投影层捕捉关节间依赖性，核心是采用基于Lucas多项式参数化的KAN层，最后通过逆离散小波变换重建时间域的数据序列。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，LuKAN在预测性能和计算效率上优于多个基线模型，拥有更好的定量与定性评价表现。

Conclusion: LuKAN模型结构简洁，结合Lucas多项式的线性递归特点，实现了高效且准确的3D动作预测。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VER-Bench，一个新颖的框架，用于评估MLLMs在识别细粒度视觉线索及基于此进行复杂推理的能力，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，基准测试对MLLMs的评估主要集中在局部细节或显性元素的感知，缺乏对细微但关键视觉线索的深度推理测试。

Method: 设计了一个包含374个问题的VER-Bench基准框架，每个问题均附有精心设计的视觉线索和推理过程，覆盖地理、时间、情境、意图、系统状态和符号推理等多种类型。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在提取细微视觉线索和基于此构建推理过程方面存在明显局限性。

Conclusion: 研究需加强MLLMs在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合与推理能力方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和人类般的分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM是一个基于Transformer的新型目标检测框架，通过多模态查询和双流注意力机制改进了精度与效率，在多项基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer目标检测模型在应对遮挡、精细定位和计算效率不足等问题上的局限性。

Method: 引入包括视觉语言模型生成的外观查询、多边形嵌入的位置信息查询及随机学习查询的多模态查询，并设计了分开细化语义与空间特征的双流交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准测试中，DAMM在平均精度（AP）和召回率指标上实现了最先进的表现。

Conclusion: 通过多模态查询自适应和双流注意力机制，DAMM有效提升了目标检测的定位精度与效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种细化的时间标注方法分析仇恨视频并改善模型的鲁棒性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网多媒体内容的快速增长加剧了仇恨言论的传播，现有方法对视频内容的时间维度缺乏细粒度分析，导致标签噪声较大。

Method: 利用HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集，通过时间标注提取明确的仇恨段落，分析仇恨与非仇恨内容的分布与特性并进行对比实验。

Result: 实验表明时间标注噪声会显著影响模型的决策边界与分类信心，强调仇恨言论表达的上下文相关性和连续性。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度分析方法揭示了多模态仇恨视频的时间动态特性，强调了开发更强大、具时间敏感性的模型和基准的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Highlight-TTA的测试时自适应框架，通过动态调整模型以更好地适应每个测试视频的特性，从而改善视频高光检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频高光检测方法无法很好地泛化到所有测试视频，因其采用固定模型，忽视了每个测试视频的独特特性和变化，导致性能下降。

Method: Highlight-TTA框架在测试时通过一个辅助任务（跨模态预测）和主要任务（高光检测）联合优化，并采用元辅助训练方法增强适应性，在测试中通过辅助任务动态调整模型。

Result: 在三种最先进的高光检测模型和三个基准数据集上，Highlight-TTA的引入提高了检测性能，表现优越。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，通过自适应优化增强模型泛化能力并提升高光检测效果。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方法，通过校准标记调整潜在嵌入，使单目深度估计模型可用于鱼眼图像，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计模型在相机校准参数变化（如内参、畸变）下表现不佳，需要一种适应鱼眼图像的轻量化扩展方法。

Method: 通过设计校准标记调整潜在嵌入分布，用自监督方法进行训练，并利用大规模透视图像数据集生成鱼眼图像以实现模型一致性。

Result: 在多种场景和单目深度估计模型中验证了该方法的有效性，并在室内外环境下均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需重新训练的轻量级方法，将透视图像深度估计扩展至鱼眼图像，且在实际测试中表现出一致的性能改进。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

*Bo Deng,Levi Heath*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高在ImageNet 2012数据集上的分类精度，并验证新方法的有效性。

Method: 采用一种新的前馈人工神经网络算法，利用322,430,160参数，并通过批处理数据集测试。

Result: 该模型达到98.3%的准确率、99.69%的Top-1准确率，平均有285.9个标签在10个批次中被完全分类正确。

Conclusion: 模型表现优越，但由于数据集中存在标注重复问题，无法达到100%的准确率。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProMIM框架，通过结合掩码图像建模（MIM）提升现有视觉-语言模型的提示学习性能，特别是改善了对未见类别的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本学习中表现优异，但适应新任务时需要高计算成本。提示学习方法虽然高效，但容易过拟合已知类别，限制了对未知类别的推广能力。

Method: 提出ProMIM框架，利用一种简洁且有效的掩码策略，生成具有鲁棒性的实例条件提示，将其无缝整合到现有的提示学习方法（如CoOp和CoCoOp）中，而无需改变核心架构。

Result: 在零样本和少样本分类任务中，ProMIM框架显著提升现有方法的泛化性能，同时增加的计算成本可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: ProMIM为提升视觉-语言模型的实际应用提供了一种实用且轻量化的解决方案，特别是在零样本和少样本分类任务中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究弱监督动态场景图生成，提出了TRKT方法，利用关系感知的知识传输强化对象检测能力，针对动态场景中关系感知的需求，提升了场景图生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因使用静态图像训练的外部检测器，无法有效处理动态场景中关系感知的需求，导致缺乏精确的定位和低置信度的检测结果。

Method: 提出了一种Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)方法，其关键在于两个组件：（1）利用关系感知知识挖掘生成类别特定的注意力图，结合光流技术增强动态场景中的注意力效果；（2）引入双流融合模块，将类别特定的注意力图整合到外部检测结果中，优化对象位置并提高置信度。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验表明，TRKT方法实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: TRKT方法通过加入动态场景感知和关系感知的知识挖掘与融合模块，显著提高了弱监督动态场景图生成的表现。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdvDINO，一种用于视觉表示学习的领域对抗自监督学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准自监督学习方法在领域迁移时的鲁棒性问题，特别是针对具有批次效应的生物医学图像。

Method: 将梯度反转层集成到DINOv2架构中，促进领域不变特征的学习。

Result: 在超过546万张非小细胞肺癌患者的mIF图像中，AdvDINO能缓解特定切片偏差，发现具有独特蛋白质组和预后意义的表型簇，提高生存预测能力。

Conclusion: AdvDINO能够更鲁棒地学习生物学意义的表示，并可推广到其他具有领域迁移问题的图像领域。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了HOW-Seg，这是首个用于开放世界点云语义分割的人工参与框架，通过稀疏标注实现高效且精确的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖离线增量学习或密集标注，限制了实际应用的可能性。

Method: 通过在人类稀疏标注的指导下构建查询数据上的类别原型，采用分层原型消歧和稠密条件随机场优化原型标签分配，并通过迭代反馈动态改进预测。

Result: 实验证明，在稀疏标注和先进主干模型下，HOW-Seg在S3DIS和ScanNetv2数据集上超过了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg结合人工介入和原型学习，为基类和新类的开放世界点云语义分割提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在稀疏视角场景下通过学习不确定性自适应调整3D高斯的权重，以提高3D高斯投影与渲染质量的方法，并在多个数据集上展现了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D高斯投影方法通常未对高斯赋予权重，容易导致稀疏视角下的过拟合问题。

Method: 通过学习不确定性来指导高斯不透明度的更新，同时采用可微分的dropout正则化方法，将不确定性转换为驱动最终渲染的连续投影视概率。

Result: 实验证明该方法在稀疏视角3D合成上优于现有方法，在如MipNeRF 360等数据集上实现了更高的PSNR和更高质量的重建效果，同时使用更少的高斯。

Conclusion: 利用学习的不确定性和正则化方法，该方法有效改善了稀疏视角3D渲染的质量，并显著提升了效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Motivation: 解决在边缘平台上，有限计算资源下执行高分辨率目标检测的实时感知挑战。

Method: 通过引入可变大小的Canvas帧以及与原始数据帧率不同的Canvas帧率扩展了现有的Canvas注意力调度机制，优化资源需求。

Result: 测试数据显示提出的方法在Jetson Orin Nano上运行YOLOv11时，能够在质量与成本之间实现更优平衡，并显著提高了平均精度（mAP）和召回率。

Conclusion: 允许可变帧大小和帧率的Canvas调度方法能够更好地优化边缘平台上目标检测的性能，同时提升精度与召回率，优于目前的先进技术。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种单步扩散图像压缩模型SODEC，用于解决传统扩散压缩方法中解码延迟过高和保真度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散的图像压缩方法由于多步采样导致解码速度慢，且因过度依赖生成先验导致图像保真度差。

Method: 通过利用预训练的VAE模型生成信息丰富的潜变量，并将多步去噪过程简化为单步解码，同时引入保真度指导模块以及率退火训练策略提升模型性能。

Result: SODEC在实验中显著优于现有方法，在保证高率失真感知性能的同时，解码速度相比传统扩散压缩模型提升了20倍以上。

Conclusion: SODEC既解决了解码速度慢的问题，又提升了压缩图像的保真度，为扩散图像压缩提供了高效的新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度补全模型在分布外（OOD）场景下性能大幅下降的问题，寻求提高模型鲁棒性的方案。

Method: 利用深度基础模型从RGB图像中提取结构和语义信息，引导稀疏深度信息传播，并设计无可学习参数的双空间传播方法，同时引入可学习的校正模块精细调整深度预测。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上进行训练，并在16个其他数据集上进行了广泛评估，表现优异，尤其在OOD场景中显著超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 框架通过结合深度基础模型和无参数双空间传播方法有效改善了深度补全模型的鲁棒性，是提升OOD场景性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言模型(VLMs)通过对齐模态嵌入桥接领域差距，但模态差异限制了无监督领域适配性能，亟需一个能够同时处理模态特定与模态无关特征的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种模态分离框架，将模态特定和模态无关的组件从VLM特征中分离并分别处理；在测试时动态确定模态适应性加权，同时设计模态差异度量以区分样本并针对其处理策略进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，结合提示调优技术后，该方法性能提升高达9%，且计算效率提升为9倍；在不同模型、基准、数据集及调整设置上展示了卓越的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过处理模态差异并对模态特性进行统一框架建模，该方法有效提升了目标任务的性能，验证了解决模态差异问题的重要性并提出了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来的神经生理学研究发现，早期视觉皮层通过熟悉的图像上下文可以迅速学习。这种现象主要归因于局部循环交互。本研究旨在从功能角度理解快速学习全球上下文机制。

Method: 通过基于ViT的自动编码器，结合LoRA方法，研究熟悉度训练如何改变早期神经网络层的行为。具体方法包括利用LoRA实现在Transformer层中的快速权重机制。

Result: （1）提出的ViT自动编码器的自注意力回路执行的流形变换类似于神经电路模型的熟悉效应；（2）早期层的潜在表示对齐顶层的全局上下文信息；（3）熟悉度训练扩展了自注意范畴；（4）LoRA快速权重显著放大训练效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明，熟悉度训练可为层级网络的早期层引入全局敏感度，混合快-慢权重架构有助于模拟脑部快速全球上下文学习模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Motivation: 现有方法对细粒度属性信息的重视不足，难以应对部分遮挡或外观差异细微的行人识别问题。

Conclusion: AG-ReID框架有效解决了遮挡场景中的行人重识别问题，全面改进了特征提取能力，具有重要实用价值。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRAM的方法，用于解决视频持续学习中的内存和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习受限于高内存需求和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出CRAM方法，将视频压缩为嵌入向量存储，使用在线训练的压缩器对视频进行编码和迭代刷新以减轻遗忘问题。

Result: 在大型视频 CL 数据集上（EpicKitchens-100 和 Kinetics-700），CRAM方法在内存占用大幅减少的情况下性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAM方法有效缓解了持续学习中的内存瓶颈，并在视频分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Method: 提出一个名为MCDRL的新框架，其中包括两步：①利用CLIP的跨模态能力识别病灶区域并构建反映领域特异性变化的混淆词典；②训练因果干预网络以消除领域特异性变化的影响，同时保留关键的解剖结构信息。

Result: 实验表明MCDRL在分割精度和泛化能力上取得了优于其他方法的效果。

Conclusion: MCDRL为解决医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题提供了有效手段，具备显著优于现存方法的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Conclusion: 构建和分析的AU-IQA数据集在弥合UGC与AIGC混合内容的感知质量评估空白上具有重要意义，并为未来研究提供了基准平台。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Motivation: 手动生成SOAP病历记录工作量大，容易导致医生倦怠，需要一种自动化解决方案来提高效率。

Method: 提出了一个名为skin-SOAP的弱监督多模态框架，结合病灶图像和稀疏文本，生成结构化SOAP记录，同时引入了两个新评估指标MedConceptEval和CCS。

Result: 该方法在多项关键临床相关性指标上表现与诸如GPT-4o等一流模型相当，充分验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架证明了可以减少人工注释的依赖，提供可扩展的临床文档生成方式，同时缓解了医生的工作压力。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

Result: 实验表明，SCSSIM对非构图性失真具有高鲁棒性，但对构图性失真反应敏感，与当前度量方法相比表现出更优的结构评估能力。

Conclusion: SCSSIM是一种分析性的、无训练需求的工具，能够精准评估生成AI输出中的场景构图完整性，为模型开发和评估提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新框架HAMoBE，用于视频的人体再识别，通过多层特征提取和决策门控网络动态整合外观、体型和动态步态等特征，提升匹配准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效利用视频中区分性强的特征进行匹配，难以满足复杂环境下的监控需求。

Method: 提出HAMoBE框架，分两级提取和整合特征，包括利用多层预训练模型输出的低级特征，以及专注于长期、短期和时间特性的高级专家结合双输入决策门控网络进行动态权衡。

Result: 在多个基准测试上表现显著提升，如MEVID上的Rank-1准确率提高了13%。

Conclusion: HAMoBE能更好地模拟人类感知机制，动态适应不同场景需求，有效提升视频再识别的性能。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

TL;DR: 本研究着眼于研究多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在复杂文档解析中的能力，提出了NiM基准和Spot-IT方法，并验证了其提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中，MLLMs处理复杂文档中细粒度信息的能力缺乏深入探索。

Method: 提出NiM基准测试，以评估MLLMs在复杂文档任务中的细节定位能力；同时提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能区域选择和高斯注意力改进模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明现有MLLMs在处理细粒度文档任务中的优势与不足，并验证了Spot-IT方法的显著改进效果。

Conclusion: Spot-IT方法在需要精细信息提取的复杂布局场景下明显优于基线方法，体现了其增强MLLMs能力的潜力。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Conclusion: DualMat框架在材料估算中大幅超越现有方法，具有快速、高效和高精度的特点，可用于图像到3D管道的无缝集成。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DecoupleCSS，一种两阶段的设计，通过解耦类感知检测和类无关分割来改进持续语义分割（CSS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSS方法由于其单阶段的编码器-解码器架构导致了新旧类别学习的干扰，难以在保持已有知识和学习新类别之间找到最佳平衡。

Method: 引入两阶段框架：第一阶段利用预训练的文本和图像编码器，通过LoRA适配来生成位置感知提示；第二阶段使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)生成精准的分割掩码，确保新旧类别共享分割知识。

Result: 在多种挑战性任务中实现了最新的技术性能，相较于现有方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦检测和分割的方式更有效地执行CSS任务，提升了保留与适应之间的平衡。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 图像上色在恢复颜色和自动动画上色等领域有广泛的应用。但由于图像颜色维度的缺失，上色问题具有高度不确定性，因此需要有效的解决方法。

Method: 作者尝试通过分类与对抗学习的方法对图像进行自动上色，基于以往的研究成果进行改进，并对不同方法进行对比。

Result: 文章提到将对基于分类与对抗学习的模型进行实验和改进，以验证其在特定场景下的效果。

Conclusion: 自动化的图像上色可以借助语义信息与对抗学习，结合大量的训练数据实现高效上色，这在多个应用领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

TL;DR: 提出FLUX-Makeup，其通过直接利用源参考图像对进行高保真、身份一致且鲁棒的妆容迁移，避免了额外的面部控制模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法的辅助组件容易引入额外误差，导致迁移结果不佳。因此需要一种无辅助模块且性能优异的方法。

Method: 提出FLUX-Makeup框架，以FLUX-Kontext为基础。利用RefLoRAInjector模块解耦妆容信息路径，并设计鲁棒的数据生成管道提供更精准监督。

Result: FLUX-Makeup在多种场景下展现出最先进的性能和强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup成功解决了现有方法中的问题，实现了高质量的妆容迁移，并提升了相关数据集的质量。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: PFM模型通过自监督预训练展现了强大的表征能力，但由于训练中的数据和结构等因素引入的潜在偏差，限制了其在实际应用中的可推广性和透明性。

Method: AdaFusion通过压缩和对齐不同PFM模型的特征，并结合轻量级注意力机制，根据组织表型上下文自适应融合多模型的知识。

Result: AdaFusion在治疗反应预测、肿瘤分级和空间基因表达推断等三项基准任务中均优于单个PFM模型，并展示了每个模型在生物语义特化方面的解释性。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够弥合异构PFM模型的差距，在提升性能的同时增强了模型的解释性，为PFM的实际应用提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前扩散模型在生成视频时存在身份漂移和时长限制问题，因此需要一种能够生成长期视频并保持身份和动作一致的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为PoseGen的框架，通过in-context LoRA微调策略在token层面注入主体外观信息以保持身份，同时在通道层面结合动作信息实现精准动作控制。此外，使用交错分段生成法及共享KV缓存机制实现无缝视频拼接。

Result: 在仅使用33小时视频数据集训练后，PoseGen在身份保真度、动作准确性以及生产无限时长连贯视频的能力上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen在生成长期的、动作连贯且身份一致的视频任务中展示了卓越效果，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上进行的实验表明，SMP方法在少样本类增量学习中达到了最新的性能，且在基类和新类之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: SMP方法通过合适的边际惩罚策略和适配器合并技术，有效解决了少样本类增量学习中面临的挑战，实现了性能与平衡性的双向提升。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种名为AHDMIL的多实例学习框架，可通过消除无关补丁块实现病理图像的高效分类，同时兼顾速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多实例学习在病理图像分类中存在较高的推断成本问题，原因在于需处理每幅全切片图像中的大量补丁块。

Method: 提出了AHDMIL框架，结合了动态多实例网络(DMIN)与双分支轻量级实例预筛选网络(DB-LIPN)，通过两步训练流程消除无关补丁块并高效分类。同时创新性地设计了基于切比雪夫多项式的Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA)分类器。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验中，AHDMIL在分类性能与推断速度上都超过了以往的方法。例如，在Camelyon16数据集上，准确率提升5.3%、推断加速1.2倍，且在AUC、F1分数、Brier等指标上也表现出一致性提升。

Conclusion: AHDMIL显著提高了病理图像分类的效率和准确性，可望为高分辨率图像学习提供新方向。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Motivation: 现有的医学图像分割模型无法在多模态数据（如CT和MRI）上有效泛化，且面临数据隐私和共享限制问题。

Method: 通过设计一个轻量级的全局强度非线性（GIN）增强模块，在本地训练阶段优化不同模态图像的强度分布，同时结合联邦学习框架。

Result: FedGIN在受限数据集场景中，MRI测试案例3D Dice分数提升12-18%；在完整数据集中，与仅MRI或仅CT的 baseline 比较，提升分别达30%和10%。

Conclusion: FedGIN在保证隐私的前提下，展示了强大的多模态泛化性能，为优化医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASISR方法缺乏对几何模式（如重复纹理、边缘或形状）的旋转等变性支持，导致处理低分辨率图片时产生扭曲与失真。

Method: 设计了一种嵌入旋转等变性的ASISR网络，通过重新构建隐式神经表示（INR）模块和编码模块，使网络从输入到输出实现端到端旋转等变性。理论分析和实验验证了其等变性的有效性。

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟和真实数据集上的效果优越，且可以无缝集成到现有ASISR方法中，进一步增强性能。

Conclusion: 提出的具有旋转等变性的ASISR方法在恢复高分辨率时能够更好地保持几何模式的完整性与方向性。同时，该框架可作为插件形式扩展现有解决方案。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别处理人类和动物运动，缺乏统一表示和泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段架构，第一阶段使用条件图变分自编码器获取运动先验，第二阶段通过掩码运动建模生成运动嵌入，并通过形态一致性模块提升跨物种运动的合理性。

Result: X-MoGen在构建的UniMo4D大规模数据集上对比现有方法，在已见和未见的物种上均表现优越。

Conclusion: 首次实现跨物种的统一运动生成，提升了运动生成的通用性和可用性。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的攻击方法主要针对目标检测模型设计，但在多模态大型语言模型上效果不佳，因为后者具有更复杂的架构和推理能力。

Method: PhysPatch优化补丁的位置、形状和内容，引入语义驱动的掩码初始化、基于SVD的局部对齐损失和基于势场的掩码改进策略，以提高攻击的有效性和实际适用性。

Conclusion: PhysPatch不仅提升了攻击效果，还能在实际场景中实现物理可行的补丁放置，具备强的实用性和可部署性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为多轨迹跟踪(MTT)的新的目标跟踪方法，解决了现有方法在低信度检测、弱运动与外观约束以及长期遮挡等情况下的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在应对低信度检测、弱运动及外观约束和长期遮挡等真实场景下的问题时面临挑战，需要新的方法来提升跟踪的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用灵活的轨迹生成并将其整合到多轨迹关联框架，先根据短期时空相关性自适应聚类检测结果生成轨迹，再用位置与外观等多重线索优化轨迹划分以减少长期关联错误传播。

Result: 在通用多目标跟踪基准上的实验表明，该框架具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的MTT框架有效解决了现有方法在某些场景下的不足，在多目标跟踪任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SPA++有效结合光谱对齐与邻域传播，提出了一种鲁棒性强且广泛适应的域适应方法，为图基域适应理论提供支持。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

TL;DR: 本文提出EndoMatcher，通过预训练和多领域数据构建，提高内窥镜图像特征匹配的通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因视觉条件困难如弱纹理和数据缺乏，内窥镜图像特征匹配在3D重建和外科场景理解中面临挑战。

Method: 利用双分支视觉变换网络、多尺度特征提取和构建包含六个域的Endo-Mix6大规模数据集，并采用渐进式多目标训练策略。

Result: 在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上比最新方法分别提高匹配数量140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集中匹配方向预测精度提高9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在跨器官和成像条件下实现零样本泛化，有效应对挑战性内窥镜条件，显著提升匹配性能。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Conclusion: VFlowOpt验证了高效视觉token修剪在计算与性能平衡上的潜力，为视觉语言模型的优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需源领域数据的情况下实现了跨领域少样本分割的性能提升，为医疗等数据敏感领域提供了重要的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack提高了视觉-语言追踪的性能，并且所提出的大规模数据集为该领域的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Result: 微调后的SAM模型能够精准分割复杂气泡结构，即使这些气泡具有高度非规则性。

Conclusion: 现代视觉基础模型经过合理微调后，可以有效解决工业领域复杂流体的气泡分割难题。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Result: 实现了无需额外传感器或深度图，仅依赖多摄像头图像和位姿训练的任意视角图像生成。

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen是首个支持多种车辆配置下任意视角可控图像生成的方法。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对医学图像中数据注释有限及全局特征中对细微病理区域的忽略问题，提出改进方法。

Method: 设计了一种区域感知的多模态对比学习框架 RegionMed-CLIP。引入一个 ROI 处理器，将区域特征和全局语义结合。同时提出渐进式训练策略，并构建包含区域标注及多层次描述的 MedRegion-500k 数据集。

Result: 在图像-文本检索、零样本分类及视觉问答任务中均大幅超越现有的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 强调区域对比预训练的重要性，并将 RegionMed-CLIP 定位为推动多模态医学图像理解的有力工具。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类可用于监控、人机交互等多种领域，其作为一种可提取个人特征的软生物识别具有重要作用。

Method: 分析现有文献和方法，以物理特征如面部、指纹、虹膜等进行性别分类；特别关注虹膜图像分割和纹理属性向量提取的相关技术。

Result: 归纳了性别分类现有方法的概况，总结了研究的现状，指出关键挑战和不足。

Conclusion: 研究为领域内研究者提供参考，分析性别分类领域中的研究空白，并提出了未来的发展方向与改进意见。

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Motivation: 解决现有MLLM在低资源语言环境中表现不佳的缺陷，特别缺乏多模态信息和文化背景，难以有效服务低资源语言用户。

Method: 提出双源策略，用于数据收集：1）从本地网页的替代文本中获取文化相关信息；2）使用MLLM生成的图像描述加强语言学习能力。引入MELLA数据集并进行微调实验。

Result: 微调后模型在八种语言上的表现均有显著提升，支持“厚描述”的生成，验证了在文化知识和语言能力两方面的增强。

Conclusion: MELLA数据集展示了提升低资源语言多模态模型性能的潜力，同时实现了语言能力与文化意识的双重目标，为进一步研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

Motivation: 当前大多数方法依赖于耗时较高的底层优化过程，导致计算成本增加，因此需要一种更快速且精确的3D高斯特征构建方法。

Method: 提出了一种自顶向下的管线，通过快速加权融合多视图2D特征，结合预训练高斯来直接训练每个高斯自编码器，并使用自适应稀疏化方法优化和删减冗余高斯，同时保留几何细节。

Result: 构建了一个高效的3D高斯特征字段，仅使用与Feature-3DGS相比5%的高斯数量，且具有竞争力的性能表现。

Conclusion: CF3方法显著提高了3D高斯特征字段的效率，提供了更紧凑的表示，同时降低了计算成本并保留了模型的细节和质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: SGDFuse提供了一种高效解决图像融合核心挑战的方案，其高保真且语义感知的融合能力能显著增强下游视觉任务的感知能力，并已公开代码以供使用。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

TL;DR: Uni-CoT通过统一的链式思维框架实现多模态推理，并在复杂视觉语言任务上取得突破性进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法在视觉语言推理任务中对视觉状态变化建模能力不足且视觉轨迹碎片化的问题，提出一种能统一进行多模态推理的框架。

Method: 提出了Uni-CoT框架，通过宏观和微观两级链式思维的推理范式及一种结构化训练方法，在多模态任务中实现了统一建模和高效率运算。

Result: 在WISE（图像生成）、RISE和KRIS（图像编辑）等基准上达到了SOTA性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力，所有实验仅需8张A100显卡即可完成。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT框架是一种高效且强大的多模态推理解决方案，结合了生成与理解能力，为视觉语言推理任务提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and

Conclusion: 通过测试时扩展和自监督优化，这种方法显著提高了GUI任务的效率和稳健性，并节省了对标签数据的需求，这为数据效率和稳健性更高的GUI代理提供了一条新的可能路径。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF)的方法，通过在高频和低频分量中建模提升了遥感图像的变化检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在变化检测领域取得了显著进展，但大多数方法仍限于空间域建模，难以准确捕捉细微变化，因此需要探索频域特征建模的潜力来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用离散小波变换 (DWT)将遥感图像分解为高频和低频分量，并分别设计双频特征增强 (DFFE) 模块及频域交互差异 (FDID) 模块提升高频特征；在低频分支中使用Transformer结合渐进上下文差异 (PCDM) 模块捕捉全局语义；最后融合高频与低频特征。

Result: 实验表明，WGDF在多个遥感数据集上的定位边缘模糊问题，检测精度与鲁棒性均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过结合频域与空间域特性，显著提高了遥感图像变化检测的性能，并提供了一种新颖且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

Motivation: 传统PPAT评估需心理学家经验支持，操作繁琐且难以大规模实施，因此需要开发自动化方法以提高评估效率和可靠性。

Method: 提出了基于视觉-语义方法和大语言模型的自动识别与评估体系(VS-LLM)，用于PPAT草图的抑郁状态评估。

Result: 实验表明，相较心理学家传统评估方法，该方法性能提升了17.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于PPAT草图的自动化心理状态评估提供了有效支持，并推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for

### [68] [Textual Inversion for Efficient Adaptation of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors Without Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05323)
*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受Textual Inversion启发的方法，通过学习新词或改进现有词来扩展视觉语言模型的词汇表，且无须对原模型进行微调，可提高新目标检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型尽管在许多对象检测基准上达到了最新性能，并具备强大的零样本能力，但针对特定目标仍需微调，而这可能导致原有的自然语言查询和零样本能力丧失。因此，作者尝试开发新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 借鉴Textual Inversion在文本-图像扩散模型中的成功经验，提出一种无需微调模型权重的新方法，通过学习特定的词向量（tokens）来扩展VLM的词汇表，以实现对新目标和细粒度目标的检测。

Result: 提出的方法能够以极少的计算资源需求，在保持模型原始性能的同时，实现与基线方法相当或更优的效果，并且避免了遗忘现象。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅对计算资源的需求较低，还与原始VLM的权重完全兼容，不影响其零样本能力和迁移能力，是对现有方法的关键优化。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Junyu Zhou,Yuyang Huang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Ziyang Zheng,Nuowen Kan,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D Gabor核的光场表示方法3DGabSplat，通过解决3DGS在高频细节和效率上的不足，实现了更高效的训练与渲染，同时显著提升了新视图合成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）尽管能实现实时渲染，但在高频细节表示、效率和内存占用上存在局限，亟需新的方法克服这些问题。

Method: 通过引入基于3D Gabor核的新型原语，构建一个支持多方向3D频率响应的滤波器组，同时利用CUDA加速的光栅化方法和频率自适应联合优化机制，提升渲染质量和效率。

Result: 在多个实验中，3DGabSplat在真实和合成场景中均实现了最先进的渲染质量，相较于3DGS，PSNR最高提升1.35 dB，且减少了原语数量和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat有效解决了3DGS的局限，表现出更优越的效率和渲染质量，可作为现有3DGS方法的即插即用组件，为新视图合成领域带来了重要的进步。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PriorRG，一种新的胸部X光报告生成框架，通过两阶段训练流程更有效利用患者特异的背景信息，显著提升生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少放射科医生工作量，改进现有方法无法有效利用患者具体信息的问题。

Method: 引入两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用对比预训练提取时空特征；第二阶段通过患者背景知识的逐步整合实现粗到细的报告生成解码。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，PriorRG在BLEU-4上提升了3.6%，F1得分提升了3.8%；在MIMIC-ABN数据集上，BLEU-1提升了5.9%。

Conclusion: PriorRG通过模拟临床诊断工作流程，显著提高了生成报告的临床准确性和流畅度，实现了领先的性能。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

### [71] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章介绍了Slice-Loc，一种通过分割并定位地面图像的新方法，用于提高跨视角定位精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨视角定位方法通常只输出单一的相机姿态结果，缺乏冗余观测，难以通过观测数据的相互验证评估定位可靠性。

Method: 提出了Slice-Loc方法，分两个阶段：第一阶段，将查询图像划分为子图像并估计每个子块的3自由度姿态，从而生成独立冗余的观测；第二阶段，利用几何刚性公式筛选出错误的姿态，并融合内点生成最终的相机姿态。同时通过计算切分图像位置分布的虚警数量（NFA），量化定位的有效性。

Result: Slice-Loc显著提高了定位精度和错误检测能力，减少错误比例至低于3%，在DReSS数据集的跨城市测试中，将均值定位误差从4.47m降至1.86m，方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过引入冗余观测和可靠性验证机制，增强了跨视角定位的可靠性和准确性，为未来无GPS环境下的智能车辆定位提供了更具韧性的方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CT-GRAPH的分层图注意力网络，用于自动生成更加精确的放射学报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法只依赖全局图像特征，难以捕捉关键的细粒度器官关系，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 使用CT-GRAPH网络，将解剖区域建模为一个包含细粒度器官特征的层次化图结构，并结合预训练3D医学特征编码器和大语言模型生成报告。

Result: CT-GRAPH方法在CT-RATE数据集上的F1分数比现有方法提高了7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH显著提升了医学影像报告生成的准确性，展现了其在辅助放射科医生减轻工作负担方面的潜力。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Method: 提出基于可变形注意力的动态加权有向图构建方法，通过结合真实坐标学习的空间偏移，适应性关注病理图像中形态相关的区域。

Conclusion: 可变形注意力能显著增强病理图像分析中捕获复杂空间结构的能力，并提供更精准的分类性能。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance (UNCAGE) 方法提升文本到图像生成中成分准确性的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于掩码生成的Transformer模型虽具有高效性和高质量潜力，但在成分精确匹配和文本图像对齐方面仍存在不足。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，该训练无关方法利用注意力图优化令牌去掩码过程，增强个体对象表示。

Result: 实验结果显示UNCAGE在多种基准和指标下，无论定性或定量评估均体现了性能提升，且推理开销极低。

Conclusion: UNCAGE为提升掩码生成Transformer在文本到图像生成中的成分保真度提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at
https://github.com/furiosa-ai/uncage.

Motivation: 现有防御机制难以在不损害数据可靠性的情况下精准识别和缓解后门攻击。本研究致力于提供更准确和有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出TrueBiometric方法，利用多种大规模视觉语言模型的投票机制检测并校正有毒样本，通过加噪纠正样本内容。

Result: TrueBiometric能够以100%的准确性检测并校正受污染的训练样本，同时不损害干净样本的准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为人脸识别系统的后门攻击防御提供了更加实用、精确且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

Motivation: 现有技术难以适应多变的物理环境，在安全关键领域如自动驾驶中存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出梯度校准策略和梯度装饰方法，以解决梯度优化中采样点密度不一致和多角度冲突问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，在多检测模型、角度及距离下，平均攻击成功率提升13.46%（距离）和11.03%（角度）。

Conclusion: 新方法显著优于当前技术，同时强调了实际系统设计中需要更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SmoothSA方法，优化了对象中心学习中Slot Attention (SA)的迭代和递归过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SA方法在图像和视频的首次帧聚合时，缺乏样本特定信息，导致聚合效果不理想；而非首次帧的查询已具备样本特定性，但沿用首次帧的聚合方法并不适宜。

Method: 提出SmoothSA方法：(1) 通过模块自蒸馏，对首次帧的冷启动查询进行预热；(2) 针对首次和非首次帧采纳差异化的聚合方法（首次帧为完整迭代，非首次帧仅一次迭代）。

Result: 在对象发现、识别和下游任务基准测试中，验证了SmoothSA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SmoothSA通过改善迭代和递归过程，提高了Slot Attention在图像和视频对象中心学习中的表现。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Motivation: 当前热图方法无法捕捉视觉-语言模型中复杂的跨模态交互，需要更高阶的解释方法。

Method: 基于博弈论的加权Banzhaf交互指数，提出FIxLIP方法，统一分解视觉-语言编码器的相似性，同时扩展了评估工具以适应二阶交互解释。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k上，FIxLIP优于已有一阶方法；此外，还用于对比不同模型间的差异，如CLIP vs. SigLIP-2和ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16。

Conclusion: FIxLIP不仅提供高质量的模型解释，还展示了用于模型间交互对比的潜力。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了理论支持的无监督异常检测方案，同时具备计算可行性，对高维复杂数据具有扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Conclusion: F2PASeg为术中垂体手术规划提供了一种可靠的分割解决方案，提高了手术的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Method: 本文通过构建强大的白盒和自适应攻击模型，评估各种压缩模型的防御效果，并分析其图像重建的真实性对攻击的影响。

Result: 高真实性且高保真度的压缩模型在抵御攻击上的表现显著优于低真实性的模型。这种表现不是由于梯度掩蔽，而是由于高真实性重建在与自然图像的分布一致性上的表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明未来攻击需克服高真实性这一障碍，发展更有效的方法评估其安全性。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

*Yunshuang Yuan,Frank Thiemann,Thorsten Dahms,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种称为SMOL-MapSeg的新方法，用于通过引入On-Need Declarative知识提示机制，在历史地图中实现高效语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在处理历史地图的语义分割任务中表现较弱，因这些地图缺乏一致性的样式和形状。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一种On-Need Declarative (OND) 知识提示机制，并替换基础模型SAM的提示编码器，结合微调，在历史地图中实现高效推理和分割。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg模型能够准确分割由OND知识定义的类别，同时对新类别具备通过少样本微调后的快速适应能力，其分割性能优于基于UNet的基准方法。

Conclusion: SMOL-MapSeg利用显式提示机制显著提升了历史地图的语义分割能力，为领域适应任务提供了更高效的方法和结果。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少工业异常检测中对人工干预的依赖，提升其自动化水平。

Method: 提出了AutoIAD，一个包含管理中心代理和多个子代理的多代理协作框架，集成了领域专用知识库，实现从原始工业图像到训练模型的端到端自动化流程。

Result: 使用MVTec AD数据集的基准测试显示，AutoIAD在任务完成率和模型性能（AUROC）上优于现有框架，并通过迭代优化有效减少幻觉问题。

Conclusion: AutoIAD框架通过协作代理和知识库整合，提供了稳健且高效的工业异常检测解决方案，对该领域自动化技术具有重要推动作用。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督的手性特征提取管道，利用2D基础模型提取手性信息，应用于点云和网格形状分析任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形状特征描述子无法有效区分左右对称部件，而手性信息在形状分析问题中广泛存在，因此需要开发能够捕获手性信息的特征提取工具。

Method: 基于Diff3F框架，设计了一种无监督的手性特征提取管道，使用2D基础模型从形状顶点中提取手性信息。

Result: 通过在多个数据集上的定量和定性实验，验证了手性特征在多个下游任务（如左右分离、形状匹配和部分分割）中的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够解决现有形状描述子中手性信息缺失的问题，为形状分析任务提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种从单目短视频中重建手与物体的新方法MagicHOI，避免了传统方法对物体模板及完全可见性的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物体模板或假设物体完全可见，然而实际场景中物体部分遮挡会导致不准确的重建结果。

Method: 通过引入一个新颖的视图合成扩散模型作为监督先验，并结合显性接触约束，实现对遮挡物体区域的正则化并重建手与物体。

Result: MagicHOI显著优于当前最先进的手-物体重建方法，且新颖的视图合成扩散先验有效提升了对遮挡区域的重建能力。

Conclusion: MagicHOI显现了在可见性受限情况下处理手物体交互任务的潜力，为可视化和建模提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的事件相机自监督预训练框架，通过差异引导的掩码建模、主干固定特征转换和专注对比学习三个阶段，优化事件数据的特征提取，在多个下游任务上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据稀疏且噪声高，主要反映亮度变化，不利于特征提取，因此需要一个能够充分揭示事件数据潜在信息的框架。

Method: 提出一个自监督预训练框架，包括三个阶段：差异引导的掩码建模以重建时间强度差异图；主干固定的特征转换，通过对比事件和图像特征保持建模表示；专注对比学习以更新整个模型，聚焦高价值区域以提高语义辨别能力。

Result: 实验表明该框架在目标识别、语义分割和光流估计等下游任务中具有较强鲁棒性，并且超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效挖掘事件数据中的边缘信息和纹理线索，为复杂场景中的精确视觉表达提供新思路，其开源代码和数据集也为后续研究提供支持。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的视觉行人跟踪框架，在拥挤和遮挡环境中表现更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统跟踪方法在严重遮挡场景下性能下降的问题。

Method: 采用丰富的特征表征，包括检测器的回归和分类分支特征，以及头部关键点检测模型，结合引入3D先验的迭代卡尔曼滤波运动模型。

Result: 在遮挡严重的拥挤环境下能够更好地进行多目标跟踪，有效解决遮挡问题。

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动模型，该方法显著提升了多目标跟踪的鲁棒性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机平滑的图像质量评价(IQA)模型认证防御方法，通过在特征空间而非输入空间添加噪声，提高鲁棒性同时维护图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往在输入图像中注入高斯噪声损害视觉质量的问题，旨在提供同时保证图像保真度和鲁棒性的解决方案。

Method: 在特征空间注入噪声，并通过分析主干网络Jacobian的最大奇异值连接特征空间与输入空间的扰动；支持全参考和无参考IQA模型，无需架构修改，一次前向传播即可完成计算。

Result: 相较于此前方法，推理时间在无认证情况下减少99.5%，有认证情况下减少20.6%；实验验证其效果，在两大基准数据集上，使用六种主流IQA模型，与五种先进认证防御方法对比，相关性得分提升至多30.9%。

Conclusion: 方法在提升鲁棒性的同时显著减少了计算成本，并证明了其在众多场景下的广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Motivation: 现有的神经网络剪枝方法忽视了参数之间的相互关系。本文旨在通过新的框架解决这一问题，提升模型的压缩效率并减少性能损失。

Method: 1. 提出Jacobian Criterion，用于捕捉参数之间的层内和层间依赖；2. 引入Equivalent Pruning机制，通过自动编码器在剪枝后保留连接贡献。

Result: 实验结果显示，Jacobian Criterion优于流行的评估指标，高效保持模型性能；Equivalent Pruning机制有效减轻了剪枝后微调的性能下降。

Conclusion: Optimal Brain Connection框架提升了结构化剪枝方法的性能和可靠性，适用于神经网络模型压缩任务。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Conclusion: SSTGNN 在提升检测性能的同时保持了轻量性和可扩展性，适用于实际场景部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video

domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research

<details>

Motivation: 为解决在训练数据中仅部分动作（已知动作）被标注，而未知动作未标注的实际问题，尤其适用于神经科学等领域及数据集具有部分注释的情形。

Method: 提出两步法：1) 引入粒度导向分割模块 (GGSM)，通过模仿已标注动作粒度检测已知与未知动作的时间区间；2) 提出未知动作段分配 (UASA)，基于嵌入相似性为未知动作分配语义类。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly三个数据集上进行测试，证明该方法较现有基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效应对部分标注数据集中已知和未知动作的时序分割与语义分类问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉-语言预训练模型在开放词汇多标签识别中未分类的准确定位能力差和缺乏结构化关系知识应用的问题。

Method: 提出Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)框架，包含两个模块：1.自适应优化模块(ARM)优化Patch特征并结合基于图像级别标签的弱监督Patch选择损失。2.自适应传输模块(ATM)利用从大型语言模型获取的知识图，进行类别间的关系信息传输。

Conclusion: DART首次在弱监督条件下，将语言模型的外部关系知识显式整合，在开放词汇多标签识别中实现了自适应的类内优化和类间关系传递。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeTok 视觉分词器通过两项创新（分组无查找量化和生成解码）优化了视觉生成中的压缩率和重建保真度，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可视化分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间存在不足的权衡。

Method: 引入了分组无查找量化（GQ）以提高代码本的可扩展性，并通过生成解码（GD）以生成视觉数据的分布模型。

Result: WeTok 在主要基准测试上表现出色，在 ImageNet 50k 验证集上创下最低零样本 rFID 纪录，同时在高压缩率下实现优越性能。

Conclusion: WeTok 在视觉分词领域提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，实现了压缩率和重建质量之间的平衡，并超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LLaVA-RE的框架，用于利用多模态大语言模型 (MLLM) 实现二元图文相关性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图文生成任务中评估生成结果的相关性问题，特别是二元相关性评估，为提高生成质量提供高效工具。

Method: 构建了基于LLaVA架构的LLaVA-RE模型，并结合详细的任务指令与多模态上下文样本。此外，还提出了一个包含多任务的二元相关性评估数据集。

Result: 实验验证表明，所提出方法能有效提升二元图文相关性评估的表现。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE作为第一种针对二元图文相关性评估的MLLM框架，展示了其在处理复杂文本格式和多任务场景中的灵活性，具有较高实用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

*Yuhan Zhang,Long Zhuo,Ziyang Chu,Tong Wu,Zhibing Li,Liang Pan,Dahua Lin,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为Hi3DEval的3D生成内容评估框架，并结合Hi3DBench大规模数据集与3D感知评分系统，显著优化了3D资产质量评估，优于现有基于图像的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产质量评估方法过于依赖图像指标，仅限于对象层面，无法全面捕捉空间一致性、材质真实性和局部细节质量。

Method: 引入Hi3DEval框架，结合对象层面与局部层面评估，同时拓展纹理评价以包含材料真实感。构建Hi3DBench数据集，并基于混合3D表示开发自动评分系统：利用视频表示捕捉时空一致性，预训练3D特征用于局部感知。

Result: 实验表明，本文方法在3D特性建模和用户偏好一致性方面优于现有图像指标，可代替人工评价。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval框架结合了全面的评估维度和自动化评分方法，为3D生成内容质量评估提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2数据集针对现有数据集的局限性，提出了一个更具挑战性和高复杂性的场景来促进视频目标分割（VOS）研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如DAVIS和YouTube-VOS）虽然性能高，但由于包含的主要是显著、孤立的目标，缺乏对现实场景的泛化。MOSEv2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入MOSEv2数据集，包括5024个视频、10,074个目标和701,976个高质量遮罩，涵盖200个类别。场景复杂度包含目标快消失与再现、遮挡、低光场景、伪装目标等。

Result: 在MOSEv2的实验中，包括SAM2在内的20种VOS方法表现明显下降，例如SAM2的性能从MOSEv1的76.4%降至50.9%。

Conclusion: 尽管现有方法在已有数据集上的表现已经很高，但在更复杂的真实场景中，现有的VOS方法仍然困难重重。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法GAP，可以按照文本指导将无颜色的3D点云转化为高质量的3D高斯分布，解决了点云到高斯的生成难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有方法无法直接从无颜色3D点云生成高斯分布的问题，旨在提供一个高效且精确的解决方案，以实现高质量3D渲染。

Method: 设计了一个多视角优化框架，结合深度感知图像扩散模型保持视角一致性，同时引入表面锚定机制确保高斯分布贴合3D形状表面，并利用基于扩散的局部修复策略来完整化难以观察的区域。

Result: 在点到高斯生成任务上，GAP在合成点云、现实扫描和大规模场景等不同复杂程度的数据集中都表现出了优异的性能。

Conclusion: GAP显著提升了从无颜色点云到3D高斯分布的生成能力，为高质量3D渲染和应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FaceAnonyMixer的可撤销面部生成框架，用于生成隐私保护的面部图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别技术的发展引发了隐私问题，需要一种既能保护身份又能保持识别能力的方法。

Method: 通过预训练生成模型的潜在空间，将真实脸部图像的潜在编码与基于可撤销密钥生成的合成编码混合，混合结果经过多目标损失函数优化，满足可撤销生物识别的需求。

Result: 实验表明，FaceAnonyMixer在隐私保护和识别准确性方面表现优异，与近期方法相比在商业API上实现了11%以上的提升。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer不仅能保护用户隐私，还能直接与现有面部识别系统兼容，无需做出任何修改。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在对话转录处理中，通过添加说话人特征的元数据标签（如年龄、性别、情感）来丰富转录内容的技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决转录文本仅改善语言质量未能捕获说话人特征的不足，通过添加说话人元数据提升对对话的理解和分析。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量高效的连接器桥接音频与语言表示，无需特定任务的模型微调。

Result: 实现了在说话人特征分析任务中的竞争性表现，同时保证了模块化和处理速度；并展示了冻结的LLAMA直接比较x向量的能力，其错误率在某些场景下达到了8.8%。

Conclusion: 在不微调模型的情况下，提出的模块化方法可以有效添加元数据标签，大幅提升了说话人特征分析的可能性。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对主流BPE算法的改进版本——Parity-aware BPE，从而在跨语言处理中达到更公平的分词效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于频率目标的分词算法对低资源语言不公平，导致其分词长且不准确，从而扩大计算不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每次合并步骤最大化当前压缩最差语言的压缩增益，同时牺牲少量全局压缩，提升跨语言处理公平性。

Result: Parity-aware BPE显著改善了多语言间的平等分词效果，对全局压缩率影响很小，对下游任务性能几乎没有实质性影响。

Conclusion: 改进的分词方法为多语言系统带来了更公平的资源分配，同时兼顾了效率和性能。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究如何通过结合重音检测模块来提升ASR系统，强调保留或重新学习语音的韵律特征。

Method: 提出了一个联合ASR和重音检测的模型，并对预训练语音模型进行调优。

Result: 重音检测F1-score提升41%，ASR的WER在有限资源调优下减少28.3%。

Conclusion: 证明了重音检测模型对于改进ASR系统的重要性，韵律特征不可忽视。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

TL;DR: PERSIST框架研究大型语言模型的行为一致性问题，发现即便是大规模模型也存在显著行为不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型的行为一致性及其潜在的问题，特别是在安全关键场景下的稳定性。

Method: 采用PERSIST框架，通过传统和改进的个性测试工具，系统评估25个开源模型（参数规模1B-671B），变换问题顺序、措辞及推理模式等变量，分析行为稳定性。

Result: 发现即使是具备400B+参数规模的模型，其行为仍存在较高的不确定性，包括通过简单的提示顺序重新排列等方法可显著改变模型结果。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型不具备真正的行为一致性，在需要可预测行为的场景中，基于性格的对齐策略可能不够可靠。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

Motivation: 解决现有多代理语言模型中静态或全上下文路由策略导致的无法适应性、token浪费和冗余问题。

Method: 提出RCR-Router框架，该框架动态选择每个代理的角色和任务阶段相关的上下文子集，采用轻量评分策略引导记忆选择，并通过共享记忆存储逐步集成和优化上下文。

Result: 进行了三种多跳QA基准测试（HotPotQA、MuSiQue和2WikiMultihop），RCR-Router在减少30%Token使用的同时，保持或提升了回答质量。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化、动态路由框架能有效优化多代理模型的协作效率，验证了结构化记忆管理和输出优化评估对多代理语言模型发展的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Result: 发现使用迂回语言的回答平均评分比其他回答低25.6%，并证明基准能够识别模型特定的偏见。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了一个检测和衡量AI系统中语言歧视的基础框架，对自动决策公平性具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了基于视觉语言聚类的评估方法，用于解决动词语义和图像解释中的模糊性问题，更准确地评估视觉活动识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉活动识别系统面临动词语义和图像多角度解释的模糊性问题，而传统的精确匹配评估方法未能全面反映模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，通过动词语义聚类生成更具鲁棒性的模型评估方法，并利用imSitu数据集进行分析。

Result: 通过imSitu数据集分析发现图像平均对应2.8个语义聚类，展示了模型性能评估的多角度可能性，并通过对比研究和人类对齐分析验证其优越性。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的评估更符合人类判断，可以为视觉活动识别模型提供更全面的性能评估。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多阶段大型语言模型框架，用于从非结构化文本中提取健康的社会决定因素（SDoH），特别是在自杀相关领域，并在准确性和解释性方面实现了提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析推动自杀事件的SDoH因素具有预防和早期干预的潜力，但面临数据分布长尾、重要压力源分析和模型可解释性不足等挑战。

Method: 提出了一种多阶段框架，对比现有语言模型如BioBERT和GPT-3.5-turbo，通过自动化测试和用户试验评估模型在准确性和解释性方面的表现。

Result: 实现了SDoH因子提取和背景信息检索任务的性能提升，所提框架通过任务专属模型实现了高效性能，且设计提供中间解释，提高了解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确率和透明性，有助于早期识别高危人群，支持制定更有效的预防策略。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对话情感四元组提取任务中达到了最新的性能，并显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过语义分区与两步框架方法的结合，提出了一种有效、高效的情感四元组提取方法，具备实用价值。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多任务学习中适配高效性的问题，并对现有多适配器、多头复杂结构的有效性提出质疑。

Method: 提出Align-LoRA，通过增加单一适配器LoRA的秩，并引入任务表示对齐损失，提升共享表示学习能力。

Result: 验证表明Align-LoRA显著优于所有基线方法，以更简单的架构实现更优性能。

Conclusion: 通过Align-LoRA证明，多任务学习的有效性来自于共享表示的学习，而不是任务特定特征的分离，提出了一种更简单高效的适配方法。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着多模态虚假信息的增加，当前主要依赖文本证据的事实核查系统难以应对，亟需一个能同时处理文本与图像的多模态核查框架。

Conclusion: 该研究表明显式的多模态推理是有效的，并展示了该方法在处理复杂真实场景中的事实核查问题的潜力。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出BEE-RAG框架，通过平衡的上下文熵和注意力优化，解决了RAG系统长上下文影响性能的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG在解决LLMs知识局限性方面关键，但长上下文带来熵增长不受控和注意力稀释问题，需优化。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，通过熵不变性原理平衡上下文熵，重新设计注意力动态，同时加入零样本多重要性推断和高效调优机制。

Result: 在多项RAG任务中进行广泛实验，验证了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG可通过熵平衡和注意力调整优化RAG性能，适应多种上下文长度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）的表现对输入信息的上下文位置非常敏感，并引入了一种名为Attention-Driven Reranking（AttnRank）的框架，用于优化信息排序以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs对输入序列中信息的上下文位置敏感，而这一特性可能影响模型准确性，因此需要探索其根本机制并优化模型表现。

Method: 提出Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank)方法，包括两步骤：1）利用小型校准集评估模型的注意力偏好；2）重新排序信息内容以匹配高注意力位置。该方法无需模型改动、额外训练或高计算开销。

Result: 在多跳问答和少样本任务中，AttnRank在10种不同架构和规模的LLMs上显著提升了性能，且无需修改模型参数或训练过程。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效的、模型无关的排序优化方法，通过对注意力偏好进行精细调整，能够显著提升模型的性能并解决上下文位置敏感性问题。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了对大型语言模型伦理推理能力的评估，作者开发了一个专门用于检测这一能力的工具。

Method: 作者设计了一个包含3,648道问题的测试集，其中包括从权威教材与案例文献中整理的多选题和开放性问题，并由医学专家验证。

Result: 实验发现，大型语言模型在实践中难以动态应用伦理原则，尤其是在Beneficence相关的难题上表现欠佳。封闭源模型在这一领域表现较优，但医疗领域的专项微调亦有助于提升表现。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA能够有效诊断大型语言模型在医疗伦理知识上的不足，为实现更加平衡且负责任的医疗AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Result: 在多个代码语言模型和基准测试上进行大量实验，验证CodeBoost能够一致性地提高性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost提供了一种不依赖人类注释，基于代码段提升代码模型性能的高效和可扩展的后训练方案。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Motivation: 当前CoT方法在推理链可靠性上有不足，特别是后期错误影响更大，需提出有效解决方案。

Method: 提出ASCoT方法，包括Adaptive Verification Manager（AVM）和Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine（MSCE），利用位置影响分值函数来识别并修正高风险后期错误。

Result: 实验表明ASCoT在GSM8K和MATH等基准测试中表现优异，超过标准CoT方法。

Conclusion: 证明了诊断LLM推理中的特定失败模式的重要性，提出适应性更强的校正机制以提高可靠性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法CGRS，旨在解决大推理语言模型中的过度思考问题，通过动态抑制不必要的反思触发词生成，减少冗余推理步骤并保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理语言模型在链式推理中容易出现因复杂反思行为导致的过度思考问题，增加了推理成本与资源需求。

Method: 提出Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS)方法，通过在模型对当前响应具有高度置信时动态抑制反思触发词的生成，避免多余的反思周期。该方法无需重新训练模型或修改架构，与现有生成流程无缝集成。

Result: 在四种推理基准测试中验证了CGRS的有效性：减少了18.5%到41.9%的平均Token使用量，同时保持了推理精度。

Conclusion: CGRS在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出色，能够显著减少推理成本，同时保持性能，具有很大的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究了在Microsoft Hololens 2混合现实设备上的可调节手语虚拟人对用户体验的影响，发现单纯的可调节性不能显著改善用户体验或理解度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过调整功能提升手语虚拟人系统中用户体验和可接受度的可能性。

Method: 比较手语专家与可调节和不可调节虚拟人的交互体验，并分析个性化设置对用户体验的影响。

Result: 尽管用户偏爱可调节设置，但体验和理解度仍然很低，并伴随着高压力、低性能和较高的挫败感。

Conclusion: 个性化并不足以提升手语虚拟人的实用性，应优先确保默认的可理解性，同时改进系统的动画及交互设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了Agentic RAG与“深度研究”系统在生物医学领域专业搜索中的应用及挑战，使用BioASQ CLEF 2025挑战作为研究平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在高水平专业搜索任务中应用LLM，同时解决专家需求与自动系统模式之间的对齐问题。

Method: 通过自我反馈机制让LLMs生成、评价并改进它们的输出，覆盖多种回答类型（是/否、事实型、列表型、理想型）。

Result: 初步研究表明自反馈策略在不同模型与任务中表现不同。

Conclusion: 结果为LLM自我改正机制及其在专业搜索任务中与专家直接输入的效果对比提供了借鉴意义。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个新基准MyCulture，用于评估大型语言模型(LLMs)在马来西亚文化中的表现，涉及六大文化领域，采用开放式选择题形式并分析语言偏见等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型语言模型(LLMs)的训练数据主要来自高资源语言，存在文化偏见问题，尤其在低资源语言场景中表现出不足。为了解决这一问题，该研究希望提供一种全面评估多文化和低资源语言能力的工具。

Method: 设计了一个名为MyCulture的基准，通过针对马来西亚文化的六个领域（艺术、服饰、习俗、娱乐、食物和宗教）的开放式多选题进行评估，避免传统选项形式的偏差，理论上提升了公平性和区分能力。同时分析了结构偏差和语言偏差。

Result: 实验显示，不同地区和国际LLMs在文化理解上存在显著差异，强调了在开发和评估LLMs时需要文化和语言包容性的基准。

Conclusion: 需要针对不同文化背景和语言设计更全面的评估基准，以减少模型的文化和语言偏见。这有助于打造更加公平和全面的语言模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLMs）的评价通常基于静态基准，但这些方法易受数据污染和排榜过拟合影响，无法准确反映模型实际能力，因此需要一种更可信的评价方法。

Method: LLMEval-3利用一个包含22万道研究生级别问题的专有问题库，为每次评价动态生成未见过的测试集。通过抗污染数据策划、反作弊架构和与人类专家达成90%一致的校准评审机制，以及相对排名体系，保证公平性与评估的可信度。

Result: 通过20个月对近50种领先模型的纵向研究，显示存在知识记忆的性能上限，并揭示静态基准无法察觉的数据污染漏洞。该框架表现出在排名稳定性和一致性上的卓越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMEval-3为超越传统排行榜分数的LLM能力评估提供了一种强有力且可信的方法论，并推动了更加可信评价标准的发展。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然在高级语义任务中表现出色，但在细粒度的字符级理解和结构推理方面表现不足，这限制了其在精确性和控制要求高的应用中的使用。

Method: 设计了TASE基准评估套件，涵盖字符意识和结构理解两大核心类别，跨越中、英、韩多种语言，包含10项具体任务和35,927条评估集，支持可扩展的合成数据生成管道，用于训练。并对超过30种主流语言模型进行评估，同时训练了一个定制的Qwen2.5-14B模型。

Result: 实验表明，尽管当前LLMs在许多方面表现出色，但人类在字符级和细粒度推理任务中的表现显著优于现有模型，暴露了这些模型的固有弱点。

Conclusion: TASE揭示了大语言模型在字符级推理和跨语言泛化方面的限制，并提供了改进这些能力的评估工具，推动语言模型低层次理解的未来改进。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

TL;DR: 本文比较了多种用于评估创造力的指标，包括创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板以及应用大型语言模型(Large Language Model)作为评估标准的指标，发现这些指标的一致性有限，并具有各自的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同创造力指标在创造性领域评估中的表现差异，并识别其局限性，以期改善创造力的测量方法。

Method: 对代表性的创造力评价指标进行系统分析和比较。这些指标包括创造力指数(Creativity Index)、困惑度(Perplexity)、句法模板(Syntactic Templates)以及以LLM作为评判标准的方法(LLM-as-a-Judge)，并应用到不同创造性领域进行评估。

Result: 分析表明，不同指标仅能捕捉创造性的某些方面，测量结果的一致性有限，并存在诸如创造力指数对词汇多样性的侧重、困惑度对模型置信度的敏感性、句法模板对概念性创造力的局限性，以及LLM评判标准的不稳定性和偏差等问题。

Conclusion: 现有创造力评估指标需要改进，需开发更稳健且更具普适性的测评框架，才能更好地与人类的创造力判断相一致。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决LLM在面对知识密集型任务时生成幻觉的问题，同时克服RAG方法在复杂推理中因直接语义检索和缺乏逻辑结构而受阻的局限性。

Method: 引入LAG方法，先将复杂问题分解为具有逻辑依赖的原子子问题，逐步解决并依次检索上下文，同时通过逻辑终止机制避免错误传播，最终合成子问题解以生成经过验证的答案。

Result: LAG在四个基准数据集上显著增强了推理的鲁棒性，减少了幻觉现象并使问题解决更符合人类认知。

Conclusion: LAG提供了一种系统的知识增强方法，可更有效地应对复杂推理任务，且优于现有的RAG系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs经过调整以减少显性偏见，但其训练数据中仍存在隐性偏差，需要通过创新方法揭示模型中的偏差。

Method: 提出一个基于20问游戏的评估方法，利用Geo20Q+数据集测试不同LLMs，分析其在不同地理区域和语言中的表现差异。

Result: 发现LLMs对来自全球北部和西方的实体更擅长推断，而语言差异对表现差距影响较小。标准评估方法无法完全暴露这些偏差。

Conclusion: 多回合推理任务揭示了LLMs隐藏的地理和文化偏差，验证自由形式评估框架在偏差检测中的价值，并公开Geo20Q+数据集和相关代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Motivation: 由于法律领域中长文本生成易产生不可信或虚假内容，因此需要一种能确保生成内容忠于上下文的解码策略。

Method: 设计了Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding (CoCoLex)，通过动态调整模型生成的词汇分布与从上下文中复制的分布，鼓励基于信心水平的直接复制。

Result: 在五个法律基准数据集上的实验表明，CoCoLex方法在长文本生成任务上优于现有的上下文感知解码方法。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强对上下文的直接复制能力，提高了法律文本生成的可信度和忠诚性，证明了解码策略在特定场景的重要性。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs在高风险领域应用时存在幻觉和过度自信等问题，导致其可靠性受限。研究旨在通过不依赖模型内部权重的方法，改进其不确定性量化及可信度。

Method: 提出了一种基于采样频率的预测熵(PE)方法，结合一致性预测（CP）技术，通过多次独立采样模型输出分布，计算并评估预测正确性的置信水平。

Result: 在六种LLMs和四个数据集（MedMCQA、MedQA、MMLU、MMLU-Pro）上进行测试，结果表明相较于基于logit的PE，基于频率的PE在预测结果正确性区分方面表现更佳（以AUROC衡量），并能有效控制用户设定下的失覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种模型无关的分布自由框架，使MCQA中的不确定性量化更可靠，增强了LLMs在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解多语言大模型中政治观点在不同语言间的表现，探讨多语言模型是否存在跨文化、社会语言和政治的明显分歧。

Method: 通过让模型对政治声明表示（不）同意来评估其政治观点，使用直接偏好优化方法对模型进行左右派政治观点校正，并分析校正前后五种西方语言中的表现。

Result: 未经调整的模型在政治观点上表现出很少的显著跨语言差异。政治对齐后，观点变化在五种语言中几乎均匀发生。

Conclusion: 西方语言环境下，政治观点在语言间具有转移性，多语言模型实现明确的社会、文化和政治对齐仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

### [138] [Cooper: Co-Optimizing Policy and Reward Models in Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05613)
*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Cooper，一个联合优化策略模型和奖励模型的强化学习框架，增强了大语言模型的推理能力并解决现有奖励范式的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的两种主要奖励范式（基于规则和模型）分别存在健壮性缺乏和易遭受奖励滥用的问题，需要找到新的优化策略。

Method: 提出了Cooper框架，利用规则奖励的精确性，通过动态构建正负样本对来优化奖励模型。此外，设计了混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模方法，开发了VerifyRM模型。

Result: 通过实验展示，Cooper缓解了奖励滥用问题，并在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct等任务上提升了多项指标性能，如平均准确率提高0.54%。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是减少奖励滥用的有效方法，为强化学习与奖励模型的集成优化提供了新的参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出OmniEAR框架，用于评估语言模型在物理交互、工具使用以及多智能体协作中的推理能力，并揭示了现有模型在化身推理方面的诸多局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在抽象推理方面表现出色，其在化身智能体推理上的能力仍未充分探索。

Method: 通过文本环境表征，构建跨越家庭和工业领域的1,500个场景，OmniEAR框架测试了化身任务中需要动态获取能力以及自定义协作策略的能力。

Result: 现有模型在单纯指令任务中表现良好(85-96%)，但在工具推理和隐式协作任务中性能大幅下降(分别为56-85%和63-85%)，而复杂任务失败率超过50%。

Conclusion: 化身推理面临不同于以往模型能力的挑战，OmniEAR框架为评估和改进化身AI系统提供了严谨的基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的奖励函数与在线强化学习结合，用于改善长文本生成中大型语言模型的事实准确性，同时提升回答的细节水平和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（特别是具备推理能力的模型）在生成长文本回答时事实性不佳的问题，这是由于缺少可靠验证方法造成的。

Method: 设计一种同时考虑事实精确度、回答细节水平和答案相关性的奖励函数，并将其引入在线强化学习框架中，以逐步优化生成效果。

Result: 在六个长文本事实基准测试中，模型将幻觉率平均减少23.1个百分点，并将回答的细节水平提高了23%，同时保证了整体回答帮助性的稳定。

Conclusion: 新的奖励函数和在线强化学习方法显著改善了长文本回答任务中的事实性、细节性和相关性，为大型语言模型的发展提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

TL;DR: 本文探讨大语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中展示的说服能力，并通过线性探针工具分析模型对说服动态的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究了解大语言模型如何在多轮对话中具备并表现出说服力的机制，同时探索更高效的分析方法。

Method: 运用认知科学的见解，训练线性探针分别分析说服成功、被说服者个性以及说服策略等方面，并测试其在数据级别和样本级别的表现。

Result: 线性探针成功捕捉了多方面的说服动态，比如检测对话中被说服的具体点，并在某些领域如说服策略分析中超过提示方法的性能。

Conclusion: 线性探针是一种高效且有效的工具，适用于分析复杂行为如欺骗或 manipulation 的多轮对话动态，特别是在处理大规模数据集时。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为H-NET++的层次化动态分块模型，专注于提高形态丰富语言(MRLs)的字节级语言建模效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的字节级语言模型在处理形态丰富语言上面临计算挑战，尤其是由于这类语言中单词可能跨越多个字节，导致计算扩展性差。

Method: 采用一个轻量化的Transformer上下文搅拌器、两级潜在超先验用于文档级一致性、处理正字拼写工件的专门机制、以及基于课程设计的分阶段序列长度训练策略。

Result: 在波斯语1.4B标记语料库上，H-NET++表现优异，取得了包括BPB降低0.159、ParsGLUE提升5.4pp、ZWNJ鲁棒性提升53%及金标形态边界F1达到73.8%的成果。

Conclusion: H-NET++实现了无监督条件下的形态学分块，与波斯语形态学高度一致，为形态丰富语言提供了一种高效且无需分词器的解决方案，同时具备较高计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该系统在工业维护中推进了LLM的应用，为不同机械组件和行业提供了可扩展的预测性维护框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Conclusion: 通过对LLMs进行棋盘游戏评估，揭示其技术能力和心理素质的优劣，同时也暴露了其技能表现的不稳定性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Method: 提出了一个称为Docking Game的博弈论框架，其中配体对接模块和蛋白质口袋模块分别扮演游戏中的两个玩家，并通过一个新的Loop Self-Play算法交替训练这些模块，进行多次迭代以实现相互适应。

Result: 通过公共基准数据集的广泛实验，LoopPlay在预测准确结合模式上比以往最先进的方法提高了约10%。

Conclusion: LoopPlay算法在优化分子对接的准确性上具有潜力，能显著增强药物发现中的分子对接效果。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Method: 受人类认知的快/慢双过程理论启发，设计了CogniWeb框架，在任务复杂度基础上动态切换直觉反应和深思熟虑的推理能力。

Result: CogniWeb在WebArena平台上表现出43.96%的成功率，同时在资源使用上减少了75%。

Conclusion: 这种融合双过程的架构为通过网络导航测试人工智能提供了一个高效且统一的方法论。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

*Dexuan Xu,Jieyi Wang,Zhongyan Chai,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Huamin Zhang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedMKEB，一个用于评价多模态医疗知识编辑能力的基准数据集，填补了这方面的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗知识不断演变，因此需要能够高效更新过时或错误信息的模型。目前没有针对图文模态的医疗知识编辑的系统性基准。

Method: 建立一个综合基准MedMKEB，基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集，加入一系列编辑任务（如反事实纠正、语义泛化、知识迁移等），并通过人工验证保证数据准确性。

Result: 通过实验展示了现有知识编辑方法在医学领域的局限性，重点强调了开发专门的编辑策略的必要性。

Conclusion: MedMKEB为医疗知识编辑算法的研究与发展提供了一个标准化的基准工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize是一种轻量级门尺寸优化框架，通过结合调优的Qwen3-8B模型和多种优化措施，在多个技术节点和设计规格中表现优异，并显著减少了计算资源的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种轻量级、跨工艺节点、跨电路拓扑通用且高效的门尺寸优化方法，降低对人类专业知识的依赖并加速模拟电路设计。

Method: 提出EasySize框架，基于调优的Qwen3-8B模型，利用性能指标的可达性动态构建任务特定的损失函数，并结合全局差分进化和局部粒子群优化进行高效的启发式搜索。

Result: EasySize在5个运算放大器电路中，跨越180nm、45nm和22nm技术节点均表现出色，相较于AutoCkt节省了96.67%的仿真资源，并在86.67%的任务中表现优于AutoCkt。

Conclusion: EasySize框架显著简化并加速了模拟电路设计过程，为模拟电路设计提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Motivation: 提升事件日志数据质量，解决因数据采集困难导致的事件属性缺失问题。

Method: 开发一种异构图神经网络模型，通过对日志中不完整的事件属性进行推测和重建。

Result: 在两组合成日志和四组真实日志数据上进行了对比评估，展现出该方法在多种属性重建中的优越性能。

Conclusion: 异构图神经网络在修复复杂多模态序列的事件属性中具有突出表现，优于传统无模型方法。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG方法通常单独检索文本或图像，无法有效处理需要多跳推理或最新事实知识的复杂查询，这限制了其在知识密集型VQA任务中的应用范围。

Method: 提出QA-Dragon系统，包括一个领域路由器以识别查询的主题领域，用于领域特定推理；以及一个搜索路由器动态选择最佳检索策略，通过结合文本和图像检索代理实现混合检索，支持多模态、多轮及复杂推理任务。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM挑战赛（KDD Cup 2025）中，QA-Dragon显著提升了模型的推理表现：在单源任务上准确性提高5.06%、多源任务上提高6.35%、多轮任务上提高5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon优于现有基准方法，在复杂场景下表现出色，证明了其在知识密集型VQA任务中的强大能力，为解决复杂推理问题提供了一种有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries

while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

<details>

Motivation: 当前符号与神经模块的耦合研究相对松散，该研究希望设计一种能够将决策树和随机森林嵌入到统一系统中的新型架构，以提升推理能力和可解释性。

Method: 该架构结合决策树和随机森林技术以进行规则推断及因果逻辑推理，利用LLM进行溯因推理、泛化和交互规划；通过一个集中协调器维护信念状态一致性并促进智能体间通信，协调符号和非结构化输入处理。

Result: 系统在多项推理基准测试中表现卓越，例如在ProofWriter上，逻辑校验使包含关系一致性提升了+7.2%；在GSM8k多步骤数学问题上精度增加+5.3%；在ARC抽象推理测试中通过符号引擎精度提升了+6.0%。

Conclusion: 通过结合规则符号化与LLM进行语境推理和假设生成，该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了一种强大、可解释且可扩展的解决方案，同时在临床决策支持和科学发现中展现了良好应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于“代理”一词在人工智能中含义模糊，尤其受大语言模型发展影响，导致研究交流、系统评估与政策制定等方面面临困难，因此需要重新审视与定义“代理”的概念。

Method: 通过历史分析与当代使用模式，研究者提出一个框架，该框架为系统明确了“代理”最低要求，同时依据环境互动、学习与适应、自主性、目标复杂性及时间一致性等维度描述系统特性。

Result: 研究提出了一个多维框架，可以精确描述“代理”系统，并提供标准化术语和框架使用建议，以改善研究可复现性和支持政策制定。

Conclusion: 框架成功平衡了“代理”词义的多元性与精确性，可为改进研究清晰性与政策发展提供实用工具，建议采纳标准术语以促进领域发展。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Motivation: 研究LLM在复杂、多智能体情境中的行为模式，特别是法律和伦理方面的推理与互动。

Method: 提出NomicLaw模拟框架，让LLM进行法律协作，包括规则制定、投票及辩护，并通过实验量化信任和互惠性，分析LLM使用战略性语言的能力。

Result: 展示了LLM在多智能体环境中的自发联盟、信任背叛以及语言适应性，突显了其潜在的社会推理与说服力。

Conclusion: LLM具备潜在的自主协商、协调及法律决策能力，为未来AI系统设计提供有益见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Motivation: 研究最小化模型在描述逻辑中的作用，以理解其复杂性并探索可判定性条件。

Method: 分析并证明了各种DL在最小化模型下的可判定性情况，包括对特定逻辑片段与依赖约束片段的数学复杂性分析，以及提出了引入非循环条件以恢复决定性的策略。

Result: 表明$EL$的最小模型概念满足性是不可判定的，并扩展到一些依赖关系片段；引入非循环TBox条件下恢复了判定性，并探讨了DL-Lite家族中不同扩展的复杂性表现。

Conclusion: 描述逻辑中最小模型推理的复杂性在不同DL片段中差异明显，提出了限制条件以恢复判定性，且DL-Lite扩展中复杂性进一步揭示了推理困难的潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理复杂的多问题推理任务时表现不佳，传统的奖励机制过于粗糙，无法有效指导模型完成含多个子任务的问题。

Method: 提出StructVRM方法，以模型驱动的验证器为核心，该验证器支持基于语义和数学等价性提供细粒度的子问题反馈。

Result: 在六个公共多模态基准测试和一个高难度STEM基准测试中，Seed-StructVRM模型在12项评测任务中取得了6项的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过使用结构化和可验证的奖励，StructVRM成功推动了多模态模型在复杂现实推理领域的能力发展。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Conclusion: 方法有效验证了其实用性和方法学的正确性，支持实际铁路操作中的主动维护决策，为决策者提供快速响应能力和故障根本原因理解。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLMs在复杂和动态环境中，因缺乏细致的注意力和精准动作规划，表现不佳；需要一个工具来测试它们对物理规律的理解。

Method: 设计了DeepPHY，一个包含多种难度物理推理环境和细化评估指标的基准框架，用于测评VLMs的物理理解能力。

Result: 即使是最先进的VLMs仍在将物理知识转化为准确、可预测控制方面存在困难。

Conclusion: VLMs在物理推理上的能力不足，需要进一步优化与提升。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI系统的地理变异性对齐问题，揭示其对社会规范和目标的影响，以及未来需要的地理敏感性对齐策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI系统按照社会规范和目标运行，但需考虑文化、政治和法律上的区域差异，这种地理敏感性问题尚未被深入研究。

Method: 回顾地理相关研究问题，提出未来研究主题，并概述评估对齐敏感性的方法。

Result: 揭示了不同地理区域的文化、法规对AI对齐输出结果的影响，并强调需要基于时间和空间的敏感性对齐。

Conclusion: 面对Agent型AI的到来，传统“一刀切”的对齐方法已不适用，亟需开发具备时空敏感性的对齐策略以满足全球多元化需求。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

TL;DR: 研究指出现有AI评估工具未能有效识别新兴法规和系统性风险，并提出了新的框架Bench-2-CoP来填补这一空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI评估基准无法满足欧盟AI法案及其行为准则（CoP）对系统性风险的关注，需要新的工具解决这一差距。

Method: 通过Bench-2-CoP框架，用经过验证的LLM-as-judge分析，将194,955个基准问答与欧盟AI法案定义的模型能力和倾向分类进行对应分析。

Result: 发现现有评估生态系统过度关注于某些行为倾向（如幻觉倾向和歧视性偏见），而忽视了与系统性风险高度相关的关键能力，如逃避人类监督、自我复制和自主AI开发。

Conclusion: 研究揭示当前评估框架与AI法规要求之间的重大差距，并为政策制定者和开发者提供了改进工具和行为准则的方向，以提升AI的安全性和合规性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且现有数据集存在偏差与主观性问题，同时LLM在ERC任务的数据生成应用有限，因此需要解决数据匮乏和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 通过一种小型、高效、通用的LLM生成包含不同属性的ERC数据集，设计六个新数据集，以补充现有三大ERC数据集，并用于情绪分类和标签失衡分析。

Result: 实验表明，使用生成数据集训练的ERC分类器模型表现出较强的鲁棒性，并在现有基准数据集上取得了统计显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成数据集的方式为解决ERC数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径，并对现有ERC分类器的性能提升具有重要价值。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出InfiAlign，一种提高大语言模型推理能力的可扩展和数据高效的后训练框架，通过有效数据选择和训练策略大幅减少训练需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法提升大语言模型推理能力成本高昂，数据选择多依赖启发式或特定任务策略，阻碍其扩展性。

Method: 结合监督微调(SFT)与直接偏好优化(DPO)，并引入一个基于多维质量指标的自动数据选择流程，从开源推理数据集中提取高质量对齐数据。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，使用约12%的训练数据达到与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B相当的性能，同时在多项推理任务中展现出好的泛化性，在数学推理能力方面显著提升，AIME基准改善3.89%。

Conclusion: InfiAlign通过数据选择与全阶段后训练的结合，为对齐大语言模型提供了一种可行且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出GRAIL框架，将大语言模型(LLMs)与图检索相结合，用于增强推理能力，对比现有方法，其在知识图谱问答中显著提高了准确率和F1值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理结构化知识（如知识图谱）时存在局限性，检索方法难以捕获整体图结构，同时在精度控制上存在挑战，这导致推理能力受限。

Method: GRAIL通过结合LLM引导的随机探索与路径过滤，构建了自动生成细粒度推理轨迹的数据合成流程，并通过两阶段训练实现动态决策，以达到检索结果的精确性与简洁性平衡，同时采用交互式图检索范式优化模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，GRAIL在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，准确率提升21.01%，F1值提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架通过改进图检索与推理的方式，显著优化了知识图谱相关任务的性能，为处理结构化知识提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用化、模块化的代理任务评估框架，与现有方法相比对任务完成及人类评估一致性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的评估方法局限于输出结果或特定领域，缺乏对代理决策过程和广泛应用场景的衡量能力。

Method: 提出了通过分解任务为子任务，结合可用信息逐步验证的评估框架，包括多个模块以捕获评估过程的不同方面，并汇总各模块输出。

Result: 通过Benchmarks GAIA和BigCodeBench，对Magnetic-One Actor Agent进行测试，框架的评估与人类结果的一致性分别比GPT-4o提升了4.76%和10.52%。

Conclusion: 证明了该通用评估框架在多场景下有效性，改进了任务成功率预测与人类评估一致性的表现。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: LORI工具可有效简化招生过程，并提供对申请者领导能力的全面评价，在STEM领域尤为重要。

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MV-Debate，一个用于多模态有害内容检测的多视角代理辩论框架，并在多个基准数据集上显示出了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体内容复杂，文本、图像等多模态信号交互容易隐藏有害意图，现有方法难以捕捉这些隐性特征。

Method: 开发了包含表面分析、深度推理、模态对比、社会上下文分析四个代理的动态反思门控多视角辩论框架MV-Debate，通过迭代反思提高检出效率和准确性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MV-Debate在准确性和效率上显著优于单一模型和现有多代理辩论基线方法。

Conclusion: 多代理辩论方法在社交媒体安全语境下的意图检测方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

TL;DR: 本文提出主动推理（AIF）可以作为开发自我学习无需持续人类奖励设计的自主AI代理的重要基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的AI系统因依赖高质量训练数据和庞大的人力奖励设计，面临严重的扩展性问题，阻碍自主智能的发展。

Method: 引入AIF，通过最小化自由能取代外部奖励信号，同时将大型语言模型作为生成式世界模型，与AIF决策框架相结合。

Result: 提出了一种可以通过基于经验进行高效学习，同时与人类价值观保持一致的AI代理模型。

Conclusion: 将AIF应用于AI代理为开发自主且受限于计算和物理约束的系统提供了可能性。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Motivation: 当前的方法难以捕捉学习动态、追踪进度和提供解释性，因此研究者希望通过新的框架解决这些问题。

Method: 构建了一种基于大语言模型的多智能体框架LearnerAgent，通过设计心理学驱动的学习者特征（深度型、表层型、懒惰型）以及通用学习者模型，进行长期学习动态的模拟与分析。

Result: 发现深度学习者才能保持认知增长；表层学习者容易陷入浅层知识；通用学习者尽管有认知局限却表现出高自我效能感，大语言模型表现为"表层型学习者"。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent框架能够有效模拟真实学习场景，揭示心理学特征对学习过程的影响，并为探索大语言模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

Method: 利用Echo State Networks（ESNs）建模短期市场波动，同时通过Lyapunov指数在混沌时期进行混沌分析，并与其他机器学习方法进行对比。

Result: ESNs在混沌期间表现优越，使用Lyapunov指数分析验证了其在高混沌情况下的鲁棒性，相比Boosting和Naïve方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: ESNs能够有效捕捉动态数据中的非线性模式，在极端波动中展现出显著优势，证明其适合用于加密货币预测。

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

Result: MLES在两个控制任务中展示了与PPO相当的策略发现能力和效率，同时提供了透明的控制逻辑和可追溯的设计过程。

Conclusion: MLES克服了预定义领域特定语言的限制，促进了知识的转移和重用，并展现出在可解释策略发现中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

Motivation: 现有网络对齐模型的可解释性有限，导致对于高风险领域中的决策理解困难，信任度不足。

Method: 提出了一个独立于模型的框架NAEx，采用可学习的边与特征蒙版，结合优化目标，保留跨网络依赖关系，同时生成忠实于原始预测的解释。

Result: NAEx能对未见过的数据高效生成解释，评估显示其在基准数据集上的表现有效且高效。

Conclusion: NAEx作为一种插拔式模型无关方法，提升了网络对齐任务的可解释性。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

Result: TrajEvo 在多个现实数据集上的表现优于现有方法，并在未分布数据集场景下也展现了卓越的能力。

Conclusion: TrajEvo 提供了一种快速、可解释、泛化性的轨迹预测启发式方法，推动了相关领域的自动化发展。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

*Xiaoqi Dong,Xiangyu Zhou,Nicholas Evans,Yujia Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了LumiGen框架，通过引入视觉语言模型（LVLM）的闭环反馈机制，解决现存文本生成图像（T2I）模型在复杂指令处理和语义一致性上的问题，并在挑战性的基准测试中取得了优异成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在复杂的文本指令处理以及精细化内容控制方面存在不少挑战，如准确的文本呈现、姿势生成及复杂的构图一致性等问题。同时，视觉语言模型（LVLM）展现出了强大的跨模态理解与指令执行能力。研究的动机是将LVLM整合到T2I生成模型中以提升其表现。

Method: 提出了LumiGen框架，包含两个关键组件：智能提示解析与增强模块（IPPA）用于增强输入提示；迭代视觉反馈与优化模块（IVFR）作为‘视觉评论者’，以迭代方式纠正并优化生成图像，形成闭环反馈机制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的LongBench-T2I基准测试中，LumiGen框架取得了3.08的平均得分，高于最新方法。同时在文本呈现和姿态表达等重要维度显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: LumiGen成功整合了LVLM的能力，显著增强了T2I图像生成的精细控制能力和图像质量，展示了LVLM在这一领域的潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

Conclusion: 该框架为多用户个性化内容生成提供了一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案，适合边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

Motivation: FSL在生物医学、材料科学等样本有限、数据获取成本高的领域尤为重要，需要开发适用于多样数据类型的通用方法。

Method: 论文提出了一个名为M3F的大型多模态模型框架，与M3FD数据集配套使用，支持多样化数据和任务，通过模块化流水线进行微调和优化。

Result: 提出的M3F在M3FD数据集上显著优于传统的元学习方法，成功提升了FSL模型在真实场景中的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个统一且可扩展的解决方案，为在数据匮乏的科学领域中应用大型多模态模型开辟了新途径，同时降低了技术门槛并促进了研究的再现性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol是一种属性引导的强化学习框架，优化LLMs在分子性质预测中的表现，通过奖励机制改进推理质量及相关性，比现有监督学习和先进模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs在分子性质预测中依赖人工设计的提示和推理模板，先进模型虽然引入强化学习但推理往往冗长且不相关。研究旨在通过引导模型更有效地提取和使用分子属性来改进预测性能和解释性。

Method: 提出AttriLens-Mol框架，包含三种奖励机制：1）格式奖励以鼓励基于属性的结构化输出；2）计数奖励避免多余属性；3）基于先进LLMs和RDKit的合理性奖励以验证生成属性的相关性。通过强化学习引导模型提取相关属性，提升分子性质预测效率。

Result: 在分布内及分布外数据集的实验中，AttriLens-Mol训练的模型以4000个样本显著提升性能，优于Mol-Instructions、ChemDFM等监督模型及GPT-3.5、DeepSeek-R1等先进模型。使用提取属性构建的可解释决策树模型也表现出色。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol有效提升分子属性生成的相关性与预测性能，同时增强了模型的解释性，证明了其在分子性质预测领域的适用性。代码已开放。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

TL;DR: PA-RNet提出了应对多模态时间序列数据中文本干扰问题的框架，并显著提升了模型的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态时间序列数据往往存在文本干扰问题，这种干扰会因无关、嘈杂或模糊内容导致性能下降，现有方法对此研究不足。

Method: 提出了PA-RNet框架，包含扰动感知投射模块和跨模态注意机制，通过减少文本嵌入中噪声影响来优化语义表示，此外，还证明了其理论稳定性，并提供评估模型抗噪能力的管道。

Result: 在多个领域及时间设定的广泛实验中，PA-RNet优于当前最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet在解决多模态时间序列预测中抗扰动问题上具有显著优势，并可应用于实际场景中评估和改进模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

*Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了InfoQ，一个无需训练的新框架，用于优化深度神经网络的逐层量化精度分配，大大减少了搜索时间，同时提高了模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在寻找神经网络层的最佳量化位宽时，需要高计算代价的搜索算法或依赖局部敏感性，但这些方法无法捕捉量化误差的全局效应。

Method: InfoQ框架通过单次前向传播，测量各层在不同位宽下的量化对后续层信息流的影响，并将该问题建模为一个整数线性规划问题以求解最佳分配。

Result: 与LIMPQ等先进方法相比，InfoQ在搜索时间上提高了效率并减少了两个数量级的数据使用，同时在高压缩率下对MobileNetV2和ResNet18模型分别提升了高达1%的准确率。

Conclusion: InfoQ框架通过引入全局信息流影响的衡量概念，在量化精度搜索和分配问题上提供了一种快速且实用的解决方案，在保持模型高压缩率的前提下实现更高预测准确率。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

TL;DR: 研究以强化学习和大语言模型为基础的动态治疗方案（DTRs）用于自动化复杂的医疗决策。通过实验评估，发现大语言模型可以在某些情况下取得与专门训练的强化学习代理相当或更好的表现，但也暴露了模型局限性和潜在失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用大语言模型自动执行复杂的临床决策过程，克服传统强化学习方法在注入临床知识和确保患者安全方面的高工程成本。

Method: 在1型糖尿病模拟器中，评估开源的大语言模型作为动态胰岛素剂量调整代理的表现，并与专门训练的强化学习模型相比，设计了零样本推理的提示词进行对比实验。

Result: 经过设计的零样本提示使得小型大语言模型（如Qwen2.5-7B）在稳定患者群体中达到了与强化学习模型相当甚至更优的临床表现；但模型在链式推理下表现出攻击性过强的胰岛素剂量调整、算术幻觉、时间误解等局限性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大语言模型在临床工作流程中的整合具有潜力，但需警惕其局限性，特别是通过精心设计的提示工程以及将语言推理与生理建模结合的混合方法以提高其安全性与效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

TL;DR: 随着极端天气事件的频率增加，现有的电力恢复策略存在显著的公平性问题。本文提出一种平等感知的电力恢复策略EPOPR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电力恢复决策主要基于地区中提交恢复请求的数量。然而，经济弱势群体提交的请求较少，导致这些社区面临长时间停电的风险。

Method: 设计了EPOPR框架，包括两大核心组件：1）平等一致化分位回归用于不确定性感知的修复时长预测；2）时空注意力强化学习用于在不确定性变化的条件下制定公平决策。

Result: 实验显示，EPOPR将平均停电时间降低3.60%，并将不同社区间的不公平性减少14.19%。

Conclusion: EPOPR有效地在恢复效率与不同社区的公平性之间实现了平衡，可作为极端天气下电力恢复的创新解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦推荐系统虽然能保护隐私，但在处理非平稳数据流时表现较差，而现有的持续学习推荐方法则不符合联邦学习的限制，因此需要一种结合两者优点的新方法。

Method: 提出联邦持续推荐问题（FCRec），并以F3CRec框架作为解决方案。框架包含两部分：客户端的自适应回放内存（Adaptive Replay Memory），根据用户偏好变化选择性保留数据；服务器端的逐项时间均值（Item-wise Temporal Mean），整合新旧信息。

Result: F3CRec能够在联邦学习环境下显著优于现有方法，保持推荐质量随时间推移的一致性。

Conclusion: F3CRec为联邦持续推荐问题提供了创新性的解决方案，在保护隐私的同时，支持用户偏好随时间动态变化的学习。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

Motivation: 当前订单分派系统偏向提高运营商收入，忽视了司机和乘客的体验。作者希望设计一个以人为中心的出行系统，兼顾效率、公平性和偏好。

Method: 提出了HCRide系统和一种新算法Habic，包括多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络，优化系统效率与解决公平性和偏好的潜在冲突。

Result: 在深圳和纽约的两个真实数据集上的实验显示，HCRide相比基线提升了系统效率2.02%、公平性5.39%、司机偏好10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide系统可以有效在不牺牲效率的前提下，平衡乘客的公平性与司机的偏好，为以人为中心的出行服务提供了新方案。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Method: 提出了一种统一的流匹配框架，能够通过连续和离散流匹配非自回归地联合建模事件时间间隔和事件类型，并生成连贯的长时间事件轨迹。

Result: 在六个真实世界基准数据集上的评估表明，与传统自回归模型和基于扩散的模型相比，该方法在准确性和生成效率方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了标记时间点过程的长期预测难题，为相关领域提供了一种高效且准确的新方法。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

Motivation: CAN协议缺乏内置安全性，易受到网络攻击，因此需要一个高效的入侵检测框架来增强汽车通信的安全性。

Method: 该方法将CAN总线活动编码为图序列，以捕捉时间和关系依赖关系，并结合变分图自动编码器（VGAE）进行结构异常检测和知识蒸馏图注意力网络（KD-GAT）进行攻击分类。此外，采用VGAE选择性欠采样以解决类不平衡问题，并通过得分级别融合优化整体性能。

Result: 紧凑的学生GAT模型在参数量上减少了96%的同时，实验在六个公开数据集上实现了高效且准确的结果，F1评分平均提升16.2%，对于高度不平衡数据集提升可达55%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效防范网络攻击，具有高效性和准确性，为改善汽车CAN协议的安全性提供了一种先进的解决方案。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

*Haoyu Zhang,Shihao Zhang,Ian Colbert,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了OPTQ（包括其确定性和随机性变体）及Qronos的定量误差界分析，探讨了其迭代量化误差的来源，同时给出不对称2-范数和无穷范数误差界，及其对校准数据和正则化参数的依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对OPTQ（即GPTQ）在PTQ算法中的广泛应用背景，尽管其效率高且实验表现优异，但缺乏严格的理论定量保证。研究的动机在于填补理论上的空白，并为Qronos等相关算法提供更深入的理论解释。

Method: 推导与分析OPTQ（包括确定性和随机性变体）及Qronos的误差界，提出基于校准数据和正则化参数的非渐近性误差分析，并验证特征排序和正则化参数选择的实用性。

Result: 给出OPTQ和Qronos的定量误差界，具体包括OPTQ的2-范数误差界，以及随机版本的更严格无穷范数误差界。这些理论结论解释了诸如按特征范数排序等设计选择，并指导正则化参数的选取。

Conclusion: 研究为OPTQ及Qronos算法提供了首个定量理论保证，突出其在降维结果量化中的优势和误差控制能力，同时为实际应用设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

*Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki,Yangtian Zi,Zixuan Wu,Tejas Oberoi,Carolyn Jane Anderson,Joydeep Biswas,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语言无关的后训练方法Agnostics，用于提升低资源语言编程性能，通过观察代码的行为而非语言特定的设计进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在高资源语言的代码生成中表现优异，但低资源语言支持不足，因训练数据短缺及每种新语言都需额外的工程处理。

Method: 提出Agnostics方法，通过将单元测试数据转化为输入/输出格式，并使用通用的编译与运行配置，结合一种名为RLVR的强化学习方法提升代码执行的可靠性。

Result: Agnostics在五种低资源语言上提升了模型性能，与大模型可媲美，并创造了小模型的多语言代码生成新记录。

Conclusion: Agnostics简化了低资源语言的后训练流程，具备可扩展性，并开放了训练数据与代码，降低了RL后训练的难度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO)，一种新型神经算子，通过使用Hilbert变换获取瞬时幅度和相位信息，以提升学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的神经算子如FNO虽然在许多问题上表现出色，但受限于傅里叶变换的周期性假设，同时信号分析还有其他有用信息可被利用。

Method: 提出引入Hilbert变换，将输入信号转为其解析表示形式，并将这一特征用作学习过程的输入。同时基于该表征进行光谱卷积来进行核心学习。

Result: 理论上展示了HNO架构在因果、相位敏感及非平稳系统处理上的潜在优势。

Conclusion: HNO通过信号处理中的解析信号理论，引入强归纳偏置，提升了模型解决复杂问题的能力。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的神经网络层——高斯混合层（GM layer），通过结合高斯混合模型与Wasserstein梯度流理论，推进基于概率措施的神经网络训练研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络理论主要聚焦于无限宽网络，强调验证其对有限宽网络的适用性。然而，是否可以直接在概率措施上实现动态尚未被充分探讨。

Method: 作者利用高斯混合模型作为参数化分布，并结合Wasserstein梯度流理论，推导出训练动态，并将其集成到一种新型的高斯混合层中。

Result: 在简单分类任务实验中，高斯混合层的测试性能与两层全连接网络相当。此外，该层的动态表现方式与传统全连接层显著不同，即使在后者已扩展到近乎无限宽的情形下也是如此。

Conclusion: 高斯混合层为神经网络设计提供了一个新的方向，并展示出与传统网络不同的动态行为，具有拓展研究的潜力。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是一个全球危害，其中一个主要污染物地表臭氧（O3）的趋势建模一直存在困难，传统模型的不足促使研究者寻找新的方案，以更好服务于政策决策和公众健康对信息的需求。

Method: 引入一种基于U-Net的不确定性感知架构，用贝叶斯和分位数回归方法预测地表臭氧残差（MOMO-Chem模型的偏差），并评估土地利用信息对预测模型的影响。

Result: 研究验证了该方法在北美和欧洲某些区域的偏差估计能力，通过不确定性量化（UQ）找出适合偏差校正的最佳和次优地面站点。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的深度学习模型能够帮助更好地理解和预测地表臭氧残差，通过结合土地利用信息与不确定性分析，有助于精确校准现有化学模型，为公共政策制定提供支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Method: 通过引入2D卷积神经网络（CNN）架构，估算物理模型臭氧偏差，并结合高分辨率卫星影像中的土地利用信息进行改进。

Result: 新模型在北美和欧洲的实验中显示比传统机器学习方法更好地捕捉物理模型的残差和偏差。

Conclusion: 研究结果改善了对城市尺度臭氧偏差的科学理解，为优化环境政策提供了新的研究支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为检索增强预测（RAF）的新方法，改进了水位预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水位预测对于生态系统管理（如埃弗格雷兹湿地）的重要性促使研究者探索更高效的工具，而现有深度学习模型在跨数据集与领域推断中表现有限，因此优化预测方法具有紧迫性。

Method: 引入RAF框架，通过检索历史上的相似多变量水文事件，融合历史模式以提升输入数据的上下文信息，提出基于相似性和互信息的两种方法，且无需模型特定任务再训练。

Result: 在埃弗格雷兹湿地的真实数据实验中，RAF模型在水位预测精度上展现出显著提升。

Conclusion: RAF框架为环境水文领域预测与生态系统管理提供了高效解法，并具有广泛的适用潜力，推动了自适应AI方法的应用。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 目前新生儿癫痫检测的AI模型评估中存在不一致和偏差，阻碍了模型的临床应用及可信度。作者希望解决这些问题，为临床应用提供可靠的评估框架。

Method: 使用真实与合成的癫痫标注数据，评估不同性能指标（如Matthews和Pearson相关系数）、共识策略以及人类专家水平等效测试，研究其在不同类不平衡和标注一致性条件下的表现。

Result: Matthews和Pearson相关系数在反映类不平衡时优于AUC；共识策略依赖于标注者数量及其一致性；Fleiss k在多评分Turing测试中表现最佳，最能捕捉专家水准AI性能。

Conclusion: 建议报告平衡指标、灵敏度、特异度、PPV、NPV及多评分Turing测试结果，并推荐将这些指标应用于保留验证集，以促进AI方法在新生儿癫痫检测中的临床验证。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Motivation: 解决迁移学习中动态选择训练样本策略导致的模型可重复性问题。

Method: 提出选择敏感性($\Delta_Q$)指标，通过理论建模和实验证实迁移学习中的适应性与稳定性之间的权衡关系。

Result: 实验显示，高适应性策略（如基于梯度或课程学习）的任务表现优秀但重复性较低，而低适应性策略的重复性失败率低于7%。源域预训练可显著降低失败率并保持性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在迁移学习中平衡性能与可重复性的重要性，并为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体沟通的广泛性，仇恨言论现象也变得更为普遍并引发现实的犯罪问题，因此需要有效的自动化方法来检测这些言论。

Method: 使用MetaHate数据集（包含36个子数据集，共120万条样本）探索深度学习中的transformer模型，包括BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2和ELECTRA，重点评估其在检测仇恨言论任务中的表现。

Result: 经过微调的ELECTRA模型表现最佳，取得了0.8980的F1分数；错误分析发现讽刺、隐秘语言和标签噪声是主要挑战。

Conclusion: transformer模型特别是ELECTRA在仇恨言论检测中的表现优异，但未来需要进一步关注如讽刺和隐秘语言的处理问题，以提高自动检测的准确性。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着真实世界应用的复杂性增加，包括分布转移和数据不平衡在内的挑战逐渐受到关注。这需要一个统一的平台来公平地评估不同DAL算法的表现。

Method: 开发了一个名为ALScope的平台，支持灵活配置实验因素，如算法选择、数据集选择，以及任务相关因素如OOD样本比例和类别不平衡比例，同时进行了广泛实验对其进行评价。

Result: 研究发现DAL算法的性能在不同领域和任务设置下差异显著；在非标准场景（如不平衡和开放集设置）中，算法表现还有提升空间且需进一步研究；部分算法表现优良但需要较长选择时间。

Conclusion: ALScope实现了深度主动学习算法的公平和系统评价，结果强调了一些领域的改进需求，同时为未来研究提供了一个实用的平台。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Motivation: 解决Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) 系统在翻译质量和实时性之间权衡的难题。

Method: 提出REINA，一种新颖的训练损失函数，通过信息理论导出，用来在现有非流式翻译模型基础上训练自适应策略。

Result: 利用REINA在法语、西班牙语、德语到英语及其逆方向翻译任务上，可在使用类似规模模型的基础上超越现有最优流式翻译系统表现。

Conclusion: REINA显著优化了SimulST系统的延迟和质量权衡，并通过21%的改进提升流媒体效率，在同等条件下实现SOTA性能。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Conclusion: SEA通过创新的误差分解方法，实现了集成学习中精度与多样性的精确调节，在理论和实验层面都有优于现有方法的优势，提供了新颖且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种针对非凸随机优化的压缩去中心化算法，分别适用于不同的场景，具备快速收敛和降低通信成本的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计能够在压缩通信和动量加速的基础上，同时控制一致性误差、压缩误差和动量偏差的新型去中心化算法。

Method: 针对梯度有界场景，提出压缩去中心化自适应方法；针对数据异质性和无界梯度场景，提出压缩去中心化重球策略，结合梯度追踪技术解决数据异质性问题。

Result: 两种方法均达到最优收敛率，可实现线性加速，并在一定误差容限范围内适用拓扑无关的算法参数，实验表现优于最新方法。

Conclusion: 两种算法在理论和实验上均证明了其高效性，在深度神经网络及Transformer训练中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: MENDR提出了一种基于Riemannian Manifold Transformer的EEG基础模型，改进了信息的可解释性和降维精度，以实现更高效的临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，且主要集中于时间域，忽略了如小波变换这些具有确定性和可追踪性的特征提取技术。

Method: 提出了MENDR模型，通过离散小波包变换将EEG信号分解成多分辨率系数，基于新的流形变换架构学习对称正定矩阵嵌入，并预训练于超过4000小时的EEG数据。通过几何椭球方式可视化嵌入以增强可解释性。

Result: MENDR在多个临床EEG任务中表现出近乎最先进的性能，同时显著减少参数数量。

Conclusion: MENDR展示了高效、可解释且适用于临床EEG分析的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的多模态情感分析模型，名为MMCI，通过因果干预方法解决现存模型中的偏差问题，提高了泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态情感分析方法过于依赖统计捷径而非真实的因果关系，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入基于因果理论的后门调整方法，将多模态输入建模为多关系图，通过注意力机制分离因果特征和捷径特征，并动态结合短板特征和因果特征以提高模型稳定性。

Result: 在几个标准数据集和分布外测试集上验证，该方法有效抑制偏差并提升表现。

Conclusion: MMCI模型通过因果干预改善了多模态情感分析中的泛化能力，展现出较强的性能提升效果。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLMs依赖人工任务和标签训练的瓶颈，推动AI系统超越人类智能能力的发展。

Method: 通过创建两种角色模型，挑战者提出难题，解答者尝试解决，双方通过互动逐步优化并生成针对性的自我改进学习课程，无需预先定义的任务和标签。

Result: R-Zero显著提高了不同LLMs的推理能力，例如提升了Qwen3-4B-Base在数学推理和通用领域推理基准上的性能。

Conclusion: R-Zero提供了一种自主、无人工依赖的LLM训练方法，为构建超智能AI系统提供了可能的路径。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的强化学习方法需要大量数据和计算资源，难以应用于小型语言模型，而现有的课程学习或数据选择方法通常依赖于启发式或大规模计算，缺乏扩展性和普适性。

Method: SPaRFT框架包含两个核心步骤：首先进行基于聚类的数据精简，将训练数据按照语义和难度划分，提取紧凑多样的数据子集；然后使用多臂赌博模型优化数据分配，根据模型的表现动态调整训练样本。

Result: 在多个推理基准上的实验表明，SPaRFT在使用最多少100倍样本的情况下，达到或超过现有最优方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的基于表现驱动的训练课程能够以最小的资源实现语言模型的强大推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Motivation: 提高AR在任务指导中的有效性，同时避免用户由于过度关注虚拟内容而降低其情况意识，确保安全性。

Method: 开发了一款Magic Leap 2上的AR心肺复苏反馈应用，通过用户研究和眼动追踪实验，结合冻结探测和问卷调查等方法，分析用户的情况意识特征。提出了基于FixGraphPool的图神经网络模型，用于预测情况意识。

Result: 所提模型FixGraphPool在情况意识预测中达到了83.0%准确率（F1=81.0%），优于传统的机器学习和其他时间序列方法。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪具有用于情况意识建模的潜力，相关研究有助于设计更加安全、高效的AR系统。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Conclusion: 提出了一种从遗忘动态中重新解读的创新方法，突破了深度学习中知识迁移的界限，为模型预训练提供了新视角。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Method: 提出了一种可学习的Lyapunov函数，该函数的梯度定义了保证收敛和稳定的能量减少路径，并引入了通过信息传递学习的切向分量以实现节点特征的能量不变进化；将能量梯度下降与切向进化分解为正交流，增强图动态学习的灵活性。

Result: TANGO在节点、图分类和回归基准测试中表现出色，显著缓解了过度扁平化问题，并与不同的图神经网络架构兼容。

Conclusion: 通过联合学习的能量函数与切向流，TANGO在图神经网络中有效推动了信号传播，显示出其灵活性与稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Conclusion: “Integrated Influence”方法改进了数据归因的可靠性，并通过引入基线提高了解释灵活性。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了冷启动问题，增强了偏好学习在数据受限环境下的表现和适用性，同时代码已开源。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

Conclusion: 多视角弱监督框架通过合理利用多种弱监督信号和风险校正策略，可以在标注有限的情况下显著提升模型性能，并具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练方法难以开发稳健的推理策略，尤其是在函数调用任务中面临探索不充分、推理链缺失及参数提取验证不足等挑战。

Method: 提出了强化学习框架，通过战略性熵探索和两阶段数据准备管道（包括LLM评估和语法树验证），优化函数调用策略和生成质量。

Result: 在Berkeley函数调用排行榜中获得86.02%的准确率，相较标准GRPO在复杂多功能场景中提升了6个百分点，特别是在代码预训练模型上表现突出。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

*Thinh Nguyen,Trung Phan,Binh T. Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法HFedATM，用于解决分层联邦学习中的领域偏移问题，从而提升模型在多领域场景中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分层联邦学习（HFL）尽管提高了系统的可扩展性，但在面对客户端和节点间的领域偏移时会导致模型性能下降。尚缺乏将联邦领域泛化（FedDG）方法与HFL框架相结合的研究。

Method: 提出了一种称为HFedATM的分层聚合方法，通过卷积滤波器的最优传输对齐和收缩感知正则化均值聚合，解决了领域偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明，HFedATM能显著提升现有FedDG基线在多数据集上的性能，同时保持计算和通信效率。理论分析显示，其泛化误差界更小，训练收敛更快且稳定性更强。

Conclusion: 通过HFedATM方法，进一步拓展了分层联邦学习在处理跨领域数据问题上的能力，实现了更优的模型性能与系统稳定性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

*Yahong Yang,Juncai He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间中的近似能力，证明其在PDE弱解的近似中超越了传统数值方法，展现了超收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在科学计算中的理论性能，特别是分析其在逼近PDE弱解方面的优势与潜力。

Method: 利用Sobolev空间定义逼近误差，分析深度神经网络在$W^{n,\infty}$中对$W^{m,p}$范数测度误差的通用逼近结果，并与经典数值方法对比。

Result: 深度神经网络的逼近误差优于有限元和谱方法等传统技术，在PDE弱解的近似中展现出超收敛现象。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络在科学计算中具有显著优势，尤其是针对PDE弱解，为基于神经网络的数值方法建立了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

### [223] [PSEO: Optimizing Post-hoc Stacking Ensemble Through Hyperparameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05144)
*Beicheng Xu,Wei Liu,Keyao Ding,Yupeng Lu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出PSEO框架，通过后验优化提升自动机器学习(AM-L)中的集成学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CASH方法在集成阶段采用固定策略，未能根据具体任务特性调整优化。

Method: 采用二次规划选择基本模型，在多层堆叠中引入优化机制，并探索后验集成策略的超参数空间。

Result: 在80个公共数据集上的实验结果显示，PSEO的平均测试排名为2.96，优于16种现有方法。

Conclusion: PSEO通过创新的后验优化策略提升了集成学习性能，为AutoML领域提供了新路径。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种名为“领域驱动RL指标”的方法，用于优化基于强化学习的ABM和RABM模型，尤其在疾病建模中，用于模拟口罩佩戴、疫苗接种及封锁行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习用于优化ABM和RABM模型，但其评估面临挑战，需要标准化指标。

Method: 提出并展示领域驱动强化学习指标，结合传统和最先进指标进行评估，应用于模拟疫情中的社会行为。

Result: 证明领域驱动奖励在多种模拟场景下有效，包括如口罩可得性差异等情况。

Conclusion: 领域驱动指标能为基于强化学习的建模和优化提供更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

### [225] [pFedDSH: Enabling Knowledge Transfer in Personalized Federated Learning through Data-free Sub-Hypernetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05157)
*Thinh Nguyen,Le Huy Khiem,Van-Tuan Tran,Khoa D Doan,Nitesh V Chawla,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的框架pFedDSH，用于动态加入新客户时个性化的联邦学习，兼顾性能和隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法主要假设客户参与是静态的，这与现实场景不符。因此需要设计能够动态适应新客户加入的联邦学习方法。

Method: 通过一个中央超网络生成个性化模型，并采用批次特定的掩码来稳定知识，同时利用数据无关的重放策略进行知识回传，确保性能和隐私。

Result: 实验表明，在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet数据集上，pFedDSH优于当前最先进的个性化联邦学习和联邦持续学习方法。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在性能稳定性、新客户适应性和神经资源利用效率方面表现出色，尤其适合动态客户加入的场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为S$^2$M-Former的新型框架，用于提高基于EEG的听觉注意检测效率，同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG驱动的听觉注意检测中缺乏能充分利用互补EEG特性的高效框架，限制了其在能量有限环境下的应用。

Method: 提出了S$^2$M-Former框架，基于a) 针对并行的空间和频率分支设计对称的模块化架构，利用生物学上可信的令牌-通道混合器以增强分支间的互补学习；b) 用轻量化1D令牌序列代替传统3D操作，从而显著减少模型参数和能耗。

Result: 相比最新的人工神经网络(ANN)方法，该框架减少了5.8倍的能耗，并超越现有SNN的基准性能；在三个AAD基准测试中显示了与现有技术水平可比的解码精度。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former框架为AAD任务提供了一种低能耗、高性能的解决方案，前景广阔。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

*Mason Nakamura,Saaduddin Mahmud,Kyle H. Wray,Hamed Zamani,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIA是一种用于推理时对齐的调优方法，能够在用户偏好对齐和计算成本之间找到平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的用户偏好对齐需要昂贵的微调或高计算成本的推理，这促使研究寻找更高效的方法。

Method: 提出一种名为HIA（Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment）的方法，通过轻量级的提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤机制，在无需调优的情况下减少推理调用，并确保对齐质量。

Result: 在HelpSteer和ComPRed等真实数据集上，HIA在多目标、目标驱动任务中表现优于现存方法，并支持低推理预算下的高效性能。

Conclusion: HIA为LLM在可伸缩和个性化部署中提供了一种实用的解决方案，在平衡性能和预算方面取得了较大的突破。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Motivation: 需要有效识别在未来数据集上最可能表现最优的机器学习算法，尽管其在基准数据集上的表现可能差异不大。

Method: 将问题定义为多项式分布的子集选择问题，提出一种新框架，结合渐近和有限样本方案，通过理论分析提供匹配下界来验证其有效性。

Result: 新方案在渐近和有限样本情况下的表现优于现有方法，并通过理论下界证明了其优势。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为子集选择提供了更优解决方案，具有实际意义，可用于选择最优的机器学习算法或其他类似问题。

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在长时间预测中准确性差的问题，包括FR方法的因果依赖性差及AR方法的误差累积问题。

Method: 提出一个双输出架构PITI-DeepONet，通过学习时间导数算子结合物理约束和数据驱动的目标函数，并通过传统的时间步进方法来实现时间推进。

Result: 在多项基准问题上，与传统的FR和AR方法相比，该方法显著提高了推断精度。例如在一维热方程上，相对于FR和AR方法，误差分别减少了84%和79%。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet克服了传统FR和AR方案的局限性，为准确、可靠地长时间积分复杂时间依赖的PDE提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉评估方案难以捕获金融应用中依赖上下文、数值及专有表格数据的特点，需要专门的方法挖掘内在幻觉，以提高生成式AI的可信性。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种叫做Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR)的系统，通过整合广告出价信息改善检索评分函数，解决在线广告系统中多阶段不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告系统中由于无法实时访问大规模广告库的精确出价信息，导致了不同阶段之间的不一致性，影响了平台和广告主的收益。

Method: 通过BAR框架引入包含出价信号的单调约束学习、多任务蒸馏以及异步准实时推理，来构建经济一致的表示和实时响应市场变化。

Result: 阿里巴巴广告平台上的大规模部署证明，BAR框架使平台收益提升4.32%，而积极操作广告的展示量增加了22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR框架通过对检索评分函数引入出价信号，成功解决了检索与排名阶段不一致的问题，大幅提升了平台收益和广告效果。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测钻井速率对钻井操作优化至关重要，但复杂的钻井数据特性使传统方法效果欠佳，因此需要更先进的预测模型。

Method: 设计了一种混合深度学习架构，融入LSTM网络、Transformer编码器、TS-Mixer块及注意力机制，联合建模时间依赖性、静态与动态特征的全局交互。

Result: 模型在真实钻井数据上的R²达0.9988，MAPE为1.447%，优于LSTM、TS-Mixer等基线模型，使用SHAP和LIME保证模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过这一先进混合模型，实现了实时预测可行性，为智能化钻井优化系统的发展提供了强有力支撑。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and

*Ahmad Saeed Khan,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于倾向评分的加权方法，名为DFW，通过构建稳定有效的样本权重来改善因果效应估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于倾向评分的加权方法在处理选择偏差时效果受限于倾向评分估计器的准确性以及数据特性，现有方法如IPW可能会导致不稳定的权重分布，降低处理选择偏差及估计治疗效果的能力。

Method: 提出Deconfounding Factor Weighting（DFW），利用非混淆因子生成稳定且有效的样本权重，优先考虑低混淆样本，同时减弱高混淆样本的影响，生成更近似RCT的伪样本分布。

Result: 通过在真实数据集和合成数据集上的实验，证明DFW在协变量平衡和治疗效果估计方面优于现有方法，例如IPW和CBPS。

Conclusion: DFW方法能够确保权重有界且方差较低，提高了协变量平衡和因果效应估计的效果，并将该方法从二元处理拓展到多处理场景。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去中心化的P2P联合学习框架LIGHTYEAR，通过评价更新的语义一致性和加入正则化，解决了中心化FL中的两个主要问题：单点故障和数据异质性问题，在对抗与异质环境下性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对中心化FL存在的单点故障、更新选择不可靠及个性化有限的问题，引入了一种更灵活、更鲁棒的P2P联合学习框架解决数据异质性和鲁棒性挑战。

Method: 设计了一个名为LIGHTYEAR的P2P框架，核心为使用本地验证集计算的语义一致性分数，用于信任度更新与个性化聚合，并引入正则化项稳定训练。

Result: 进行的两组数据实验显示，新方法在客户层面的表现优于中心化FL和现有P2P方法，在对抗性与异质条件下效果尤为明显。

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR通过P2P架构和创新一致性分数指标有效解决了中心化FL的主要局限，其个性化与鲁棒性为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练（QAT）研究方法都是在尽量减少全精度模型的量化误差，但准确性受限于全精度上限，无法突破该限制。

Method: 提出Fairy±i框架，通过将权重映射到复域的单位根上，实现信息论最优的2-bit对称量化表示，并且通过只保留实部或虚部实现无需乘法的高效推理。

Result: Fairy±i在困惑度（PPL）和下游任务上的表现超越现有2-bit量化方法的上限，同时保证存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: Fairy±i证明了在极低比特条件下构建高精度、实用LLMs的新方向，成功实现了打破全精度模型上限并高效量化的目标。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

TL;DR: 该研究提出Cross-LoRA，一种跨模型的LoRA传输方法，可在无需额外训练数据的情况下适用于不同的大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法受限于基础模型架构，难以跨越异构的预训练大语言模型（LLMs）。作者寻求一种可以在不同模型间通用的PEFT方法。

Method: 提出Cross-LoRA框架，包括两个主要组件：1）LoRA-Align：通过SVD和Frobenius最优线性变换实现源模型和目标模型间的子空间对齐；2）LoRA-Shift：将源LoRA权重更新投影到目标模型参数空间中，整个过程无需数据和训练。

Result: 在ARCs、OBOA和HellaSwag基准测试中，实现了相对基础模型性能提升的高达5.26%的效果，并在其他常识推理测试中表现接近直接训练LoRA的性能。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA方法实现了在无需数据和额外训练的条件下，在不同预训练模型间有效传输LoRA模块并获得显著性能提升的目标。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗领域中具有生成可解释CPs的潜力，可以提升医疗决策支持的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新方法MoBE，用于对专家混合模型进行压缩，同时将精度下降控制在较低范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE基础的大规模语言模型因在部署时需要大量内存，带来了严峻的挑战。当前方法在模型压缩中常造成显著的准确性下降，因此需要一种更优化的解决方案。

Method: 提出Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) 方法，通过将专家中的上/门矩阵采用秩分解形式表达，并利用共享的基矩阵进一步参数化大矩阵B，从而进行模型压缩。

Result: 实验表明，MoBE在减少参数量的同时，准确率仅下降1%-2%，效果远优于之前的研究方法。

Conclusion: MoBE在减小内存需求的同时实现了较低的精度损失，为大规模语言模型的部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在测试集上的R²为0.5386，MSE为0.005806，MAE为0.057147，均优于单一模型LSTM (R²=0.0208) 和RF (R²=0.4934)。

Conclusion: 提出的LSTM-RF混合模型能有效提高海洋生态变量的高频预测精度，具有创新性和实用价值。

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

Motivation: 现有的时间序列基础模型在泛化能力、适应不同采样率以及计算效率等方面存在局限性，且无法满足变长预测需求。

Method: 设计了一种基于状态空间模型的编码器与函数基解码器，将连续时间建模与动态时间尺度调整融入模型结构，同时提出高效的预训练策略以提高鲁棒性与训练速度。

Conclusion: FlowState能够高效适应输入采样率的变化，拥有更低的数据需求、模型规模和更高的运行效率，是当前时间序列建模领域的新SOTA。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Motivation: 传统的监督微调难以捕捉如停留时间、情感极性等隐式用户反馈信号，本文旨在通过强化学习方法更好地对齐用户偏好。

Method: 利用基于弱标记交互信息的奖励模型$R_{\phi}$，通过近端策略优化（PPO）方法优化基础LLM模型$M_{\theta}$，并模拟对话状态转换机制。

Result: 实验表明，该RLHF微调模型在推荐准确性、一致性和用户满意度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 隐式信号对齐在实现可扩展且用户自适应推荐系统设计方面具有效用。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$

Result: 提出并验证了减少SFO复杂性所需的理论最优增长策略，为大批量高效训练提供了理论与实践支持。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习的大批量训练提供了理论和实践指导，提高了可扩展性与训练效率。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Result: 实验表明，这种自适应联合调度方法相比现有调度器能够显著提高收敛速度。

Conclusion: 自适应批量大小与学习率调节的联合策略，可以有效改善SGD的性能并加速深度神经网络训练的收敛。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互模仿学习需要大量人类教师的反馈，限制了其广泛应用。本研究旨在减少所需的查询数量。

Method: 引入ASkDAgger框架，通过三种方式利用新手行动计划和反馈：(1) S-Aware Gating，动态调整敏感度门控；(2) Foresight Interactive Experience Replay，将新手计划重塑为示范；(3) Prioritized Interactive Experience Replay，基于多种指标优先回放。

Result: ASkDAgger框架在语言条件操控任务中减少了示范标注数量，提升了泛化能力，加速了对环境变化的适应。

Conclusion: ASkDAgger框架通过新颖的数据利用方法有效提高了交互模仿学习的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了USP框架，通过特征空间保留、分治伪标签和类均值锚定蒸馏来解决半监督持续学习中的记忆稳定性、学习灵活性及无标签数据学习的平衡问题，最后精度提升最高可达5.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督持续学习（SSCL）旨在通过利用有标签和无标签数据减少标注成本并管理连续的数据流到来，但需要平衡无标签学习、记忆稳定性和学习灵活性，存在较大挑战。

Method: 提出USP框架，包括三个关键方法：（1）特征空间保留策略（FSR），通过构造等角紧框架为旧类保留特征位置；（2）分治伪标签（DCP），为高低置信度的无标签数据分配可靠伪标签；（3）类均值锚定无标签蒸馏（CUD），利用DCP输出将无标签数据锚定于稳定的类均值以防遗忘。

Result: 在综合评估中，USP框架的最终准确率较之前的半监督持续学习方法提高最多达5.94%。

Conclusion: USP框架有效平衡了半监督持续学习中的记忆稳定性、学习灵活性及无标签学习，优于现有方法，效果显著。

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its

### [248] [Optimal Corpus Aware Training for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05364)
*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了优化语料库感知训练（OCAT）方法，通过冻结大部分模型参数，仅微调与语料相关的小部分参数，以提高模型翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语料库感知训练（CAT）方法依赖于预先定义高质量数据，这在实际操作中容易出错且效率低下。为解决这一问题，需要优化方法，以提升性能并降低对超参数的敏感性。

Method: OCAT方法在CAT预训练模型的基础上，通过冻结大部分模型参数，仅调整小部分与语料相关的参数，从而实现轻量化和高效的优化。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别较普通训练提升了+3.6和+1.8的chrF分数，其性能与其他先进微调技术相当，甚至略胜一筹，同时对超参数设置的敏感性较低。

Conclusion: OCAT方法克服了传统语料库感知训练的局限性，显著提升翻译任务的性能，且方法轻量、高效、稳健，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

*Newton Mwai,Emil Carlsson,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了放宽潜变量多臂赌博机假设的框架，仅要求潜变量状态下的动作偏好顺序模型，而无需完全了解奖励分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前潜变量多臂赌博机方法假设奖励分布已知且准确，但实际中此条件难以满足，在个性化任务中从零开始探索成本较高。

Method: 提出了一种基于动作偏好顺序的后验采样算法，允许同潜状态的实例在奖励分布上不同，但偏好顺序一致。

Result: 该方法在奖励分布明确时表现可与传统潜变量方法媲美，在奖励尺度不同的情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 放宽假设后的方法更加灵活，对潜变量问题的解决更具实际意义，提升了个性化任务的效率。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

*Jie Xiao,Shaoduo Gan,Changyuan Fan,Qingnan Ren,Alfred Long,Yuchen Zhang,Rymon Yu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Echo的新系统，用于分布式强化学习，针对当前RL训练中的问题进行了优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL训练中推理采样与策略优化共存造成的性能问题，并引入更高效的分布式训练设计。

Method: 通过异构“推理”和“训练”集群的分离设计，Echo系统采用了两种同步协议：顺序拉取模式以最小化偏置，异步推拉模式通过缓冲区优化硬件利用率。

Result: 以Qwen3-4B、Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen3-32B三种RL任务在分布式集群上的实验为例，Echo达到了与完全紧邻式Verl基线相当的收敛速度和最终奖励。

Conclusion: Echo展示了利用分布式异构资源可实现数据中心级性能，为LLM的RL提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于深度神经网络容易受到后门攻击，文中提出新机制以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用非目标标签训练（NT）和互学习（ML），通过教师模型和学生模型合作优化，最终实现模型净化。

Result: NT-ML在6种后门攻击中表现出色，在仅有少量干净样本的情况下优于5种先进后门防御方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种有效的后门攻击防御机制，在理论和实践中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了一种基于累积路径的自适应学习率机制，该机制能动态调整步长以适应损失景观，并提出了针对Adam优化器的改进版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率是深度学习中的关键超参数，其理想值因问题而异且可能会随训练阶段改变。本文旨在探讨一种能够动态调整学习率以提高训练表现的方法。

Method: 重新审视并改进了2017年提出的基于累积路径的学习率调整方案，该方案通过观测路径长度（归一化梯度步长的时间折扣和）与随机游走预期长度之间的差异调整学习率。同时修正了该方法中与Adam优化器内部预处理不一致的问题。

Result: 通过对比实验，评估了带有和不带累积路径自适应的SGD和Adam优化器的表现，并与近期的其他方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 研究结果阐明了这种自适应策略在何种情况下以及为什么能够提供实际优势。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种因果感知框架，用于根据文本描述生成高质量、多样性的分子，同时实现快速推断，并在多个标准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的方法难以同时实现高质量生成、多样性和快速推断，因此需要一种能够有效解决这些挑战的新方法。

Method: 研究引入了因果感知Transformer (CAT)，以及一个改进的变分流模型框架（VMF），以高效地处理分子图和文本指令的联合编码，并加强潜在空间表达能力。

Result: 在四个标准分子基准测试中，模型在新颖性、多样性和有效性等指标上超过了现有最优基线方法。此外，VMF比基于扩散的方法具有更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了因果感知Transformer和增强的流模型如何实现文本条件下的分子高效生成，并具有显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文引入了NegBio-VAE，这是一种利用负二项分布建模神经元尖峰计数的新方法，相较于现有模型显著提高了重构精准度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Poisson-VAE通过泊松分布建模神经元尖峰计数，但限制了均值和方差的相等性，无法准确反映神经活动的随机性。

Method: 提出NegBio-VAE框架，利用负二项分布替代泊松分布建模尖峰计数。同时开发了两种ELBO优化方案和两种负二项分布的可微重参数化策略，增加一个离散参数来实现更灵活的分布控制。

Result: 实验结果表明，NegBio-VAE在精细建模和重构神经活动方面具备显著优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入负二项分布和额外的分散参数，NegBio-VAE扩展了Poisson-VAE的潜在模型，显著提升了对神经元活动的建模能力。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

*Jiansheng Rao,Jiayi Li,Zhizhi Gong,Soummya Kar,Haoxuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为CR-FMOL的框架，该框架通过引入新颖的偏好锥约束，在联邦学习中实现了客户端公平性的帕累托最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的联邦学习方法（例如FedAvg）倾向于优化大多数客户，而少数客户的需求被忽视。需要一种可以在客户之间实现公平性的优化方法。

Method: 提出了Conically-Regularised Federated Multi-Objective Learning (CR-FMOL)。每个客户端传递聚合的任务损失向量作为偏好，服务器通过解决一个锥约束的帕累托多任务学习子问题来生成下降方向，从而实现每个客户端的帕累托最优性。

Result: CR-FMOL在实验中表现出增强的客户端公平性，不同客户端的优化水平更均衡，尽管初期表现稍逊于FedAvg，但经过足够的训练轮次预计可以达到相似的准确度。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL在实现联邦学习中的客户端公平性方面有显著改进，具有潜力在充分训练下达到优异的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一种名为Group Causal Policy Optimization (GCPO)的新方法，通过结合因果结构优化来提升大语言模型在推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型虽然在多任务中表现优异，但在专用领域仍需要后续训练。而当前的方法如Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)虽然高效，但忽略了候选响应间的语义相互作用。

Method: 研究者首先提出了一个结构因果模型（SCM），揭示候选响应因最终集成输出形成的冲突结构中的隐藏依赖性，然后基于这一因果分析，提出将响应投影到因果子空间并结合奖励调整和新的KL正则化项优化策略。

Result: 实验证明，GCPO在多个推理基准上持续优于包括GRPO在内的现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合因果结构进行优化是提升推理任务效果的一种高效方法，并且GCPO在多个推理任务中的表现证明了其优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析用于预测事件发生时间，但在实际中，许多竞争风险未被正确处理，这种忽视可能导致风险估计的系统性偏差和群体间不公平性。

Method: 作者形式化描述了将竞争风险误分类为删失的问题，并开发了一种框架测量由此引起的误差，评估了其对预测性能和算法公平性的影响。

Result: 研究表明，在实证分析中（如心血管疾病管理），忽略竞争风险会对高风险个体造成较大影响，加剧既有的不平等。同时证明了群体间的风险差异导致特定群体的误差加大。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁在生存模型开发中，务必采取方法处理竞争风险，以提高模型准确性，减少风险评估中的不公平性，并更好地支持决策。

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全感知MCTS方法无法提供对高风险结果（尾部风险）的严格控制，这在高风险场景中可能导致严重后果。作者希望通过改进MCTS算法，提供更为严格的尾部风险保障。

Method: 提出了基于条件风险价值（CVaR）的CVaR-MCTS和基于Wasserstein模糊集的W-MCTS两种方法，分别用于显式控制尾部风险和解决有限样本导致的风险估计偏差问题，并提供了PAC尾部安全性保证和算法的遗憾界限。

Result: 实验结果表明，这两种方法在不同的模拟环境中表现优越，能够有效实现鲁棒的尾部风险保障，同时改善奖励和稳定性。

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS能够以更高的稳定性和更低的尾部风险适应复杂的高风险决策场景，为MCTS的尾部安全性提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Motivation: 解决现有时间序列预测方法在多尺度时间动态和数据不规则性下的局限性，为发电规划和分配提供更优方案。

Method: 引入多尺度特征提取机制、基于蒙特卡罗消融的概率预测框架、未来已知变量整合路径及预训练和微调优化方式。

Result: 实验结果表明，EnergyPatchTST在常见的数据集上预测误差降低了7-12%，并能够提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST增强了能源领域时间序列预测的表现，为能源预测提供了更高效可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经网络的内部表示如何受输入数据复杂性及解决问题难度影响尚不清楚。

Method: 采用五种数据无关的探针方法（剪枝、二值化、噪声注入、符号翻转和双分图随机化）从网络科学视角研究多层感知机的表示拓扑与鲁棒性之间的关系；对比MNIST和Fashion-MNIST上简单和复杂分类任务的表现。

Result: 复杂任务模型中二值化权重会导致准确率降到随机水平，而简单任务模型保持鲁棒性。此外，剪除低幅值边在复杂任务模型中表现出明显性能相变；适度注入噪声可提高准确率，并揭示一种类似最佳符号翻转效果的随机共振现象；维护符号结构能维持高准确率。

Conclusion: 复杂任务的表示拓扑在签名二分图中起关键作用，这为模型压缩和可解释性的设计方法提供了新的思路，且可作为任务复杂度的模型无关度量方式。

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI系统的挑战在于缺少真实标签，并且需要防止评估指标被操作或“游戏化”。本研究的目标是设计能够抵抗游戏化的评估机制，以提高任务性能。

Method: 通过信息论中的f-互信息量化技术，构建抗游戏化的评估机制，证明其唯一性。此外，通过实验探索多个领域中的实际表现。

Result: 在十个领域的实验结果显示，信息论机制能够完全区分真实与策略性回答，并展现更高的鲁棒性，评估准确率提升10-100倍。同时，评估性能随压缩比呈倒U型变化。

Conclusion: 研究表明，信息论方法能有效地评估AI任务表现，为AI评估提供了更加稳健的工具，并拓展了抗对抗性和评估有效性的新维度。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的观察过程（临床存在）影响建模结果，而忽略这些因素会限制预测模型的表现和可移植性。

Method: 通过多任务递归神经网络联合建模观察时间间隔、缺失过程和生存结果，并定义临床存在偏移的概念，理论上证明这种方法如何改善模型的可移植性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集的实际死亡率预测任务上，与未考虑观察过程的现有模型相比，这种方法提高了性能和可移植性。

Conclusion: 充分利用临床存在信息可以显著提升预测模型的性能和可移植性，对新环境中的部署尤为重要。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

TL;DR: MoMA架构通过多模态电子健康记录（EHR）数据进行临床预测任务，展示了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在临床预测中更有效地整合多模态数据，提高预测模型的性能。

Method: 使用多层LLM代理，包括专家代理将非文本模态转换为结构化文本描述，聚合代理整合多模态数据，预测代理进行临床预测。

Result: 在不同的任务和数据集上，MoMA的表现优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoMA架构通过整合多模态数据显著提高了临床预测任务的灵活性和准确性，展示了其在医疗数据分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

*Kristina P. Sinaga,Sara Colantonio,Miin-Shen Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种用于多视图聚类的新算法：AMVFCM-U和AAMVFCM-U，提供了一个无参数框架，通过熵正则化实现自适应跨视图一致性，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图聚类方法在处理异质数据、管理高维特征以及过滤无关信息方面存在挑战，且需要手动调参并缺乏有效的跨视图集成机制。

Method: 引入无参数框架，通过熵正则化取代模糊化参数，基于信噪比的正则化实现可解释的特征加权，并通过双层熵机制实现视图和特征的自适应平衡；AAMVFCM-U进一步通过分层降维优化特征和视图。

Result: 在五个基准测试上超越15种最先进方法，AAMVFCM-U在计算效率上提高了97%，数据维度降至原来的0.45%，并自动识别关键视图组合。

Conclusion: 新算法不仅解决了多视图聚类的关键问题，还在效率与效果上实现了显著提升，为异质数据聚类提供了新工具。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

*Hrithik Suresh,Sahil Sidheekh,Vishnu Shreeram M. P,Sriraam Natarajan,Narayanan C. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的正则化方法，解决概率电路（PCs）训练中的过拟合问题，改善了泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度概率电路的表达能力增强，在数据有限情况下易出现过拟合情况，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出一种基于Hessian正则化的方法，通过计算对数似然Hessian的迹值（sharpness指标），引入基于梯度范数的正则化，结合EM算法与梯度方法进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效引导PCs达到较平缓的最优点，提高泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过优化sharpness指标的新方法，解决了PCs中过拟合问题，改进了模型在合成和现实数据集上的表现。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

TL;DR: 本文综述了视觉-语言模型（VLMs）无监督适配的研究，提出了按无标签视觉数据特点的四种适配范式分类，并对其核心方法进行了分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs尽管在多任务上展现了出色的泛化能力，但在具体任务中的表现仍需改进，因此研究无监督任务自适应方法成为必要。

Method: 提出了一种基于无标签视觉数据性质的分类方法，将适配方法分为四类：无数据迁移、大量数据域迁移、批量测试时间适配与在线测试时间适配，并系统化分析了每种方法。

Result: 综述并分类了现有方法和基准，提供了对该领域的全面理解，同时指出该领域的开放挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 建立了一个系统化的无监督适配框架，为视觉-语言模型的应用和研究提供了宝贵的指导和新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

### [267] [X-VFL: A New Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05568)
*Qinghua Yao,Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VFL解决了纵向联邦学习中的两个主要挑战，即非对齐数据的部分特征缺失问题和支持各客户端独立推断的问题，采用了XCom和DS-Align模块并在实际数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的纵向联邦学习需要完全对齐的数据样本和协作推断，这限制了其在部分特征缺失及独立推断场景中的应用。

Method: 提出X-VFL框架，通过XCom模块完成样本特征补全，并利用DS-Align模块对决策子空间中的特征对齐，支持局部独立推断；理论分析了算法收敛性质。

Result: 在真实数据集（如CIFAR-10和MIMIC-III）上表现突出，分别提升准确率15%和43%。

Conclusion: X-VFL提供了处理部分缺失特征和支持客户端独立推断的有效方法，优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展PyKEEN框架的工具，用于提供高级的负采样策略，从而提升知识图谱嵌入模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多知识图谱嵌入方法依赖正负样本进行训练，但先进的负采样策略支持较少。

Method: 为流行的PyKEEN框架开发了拓展模块，集成多种先进和模块化的负采样策略，包括静态和动态破坏方式。

Result: 通过实验研究，证明了所开发的扩展模块对不同嵌入方法在链接预测任务中的性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该扩展模块不仅增强了PyKEEN的功能，还简化了嵌入方法的开发和定制流程，同时提供了设计更有效负采样策略的指导。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Conclusion: 单一毒样本在满足特定条件下可以实现反向门攻击，这为低成本攻击的可能性提供了理论和实验依据。

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Conclusion: 结果强调了在多模态语言模型中，通过数据驱动的适配优化可以实现更高效的强化学习训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Motivation: 现有的监督微调（SFT）方法在泛化能力上不如强化学习（RL）。

Method: 通过数学分析表明，标准的SFT梯度中存在问题的奖励结构会限制模型的泛化能力，并提出通过动态调整目标函数以优化梯度更新的DFT方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试和基础模型中，DFT显著优于标准的SFT，并在离线RL设置中也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 本研究在理论和实践上均显著提升了SFT的性能，为离线RL提供了一个更简单有效的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示为何人类可以通过技术进步实现资源无限扩展，并探讨开放式技术演化的基础条件。

Method: 提出了一个宏观模型，将技术系统与搜索空间的文化进化动力学耦合进行分析，并操纵随机性和选择性力量对其动态的影响。

Result: 研究发现开放式增长是极其罕见的，它需要技术系统和搜索空间的共进化以及随机与选择力量的平衡。

Conclusion: 只有在技术系统与搜索空间动态保持共进化并有效扩大时，才能实现开放式技术进化和资源持续增长。

Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and
cumulatively improve technologies in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness
provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and
to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a
collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from
the interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of
interdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the
aggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting
from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological
systems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By
manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic
or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely
rare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and
search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to
continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas
selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained
production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains
effective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search
space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended
technological evolution.
