*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Lumina-mGPT 2.0，一个从零开始训练的纯解码器自回归高质量图像生成模型，在多任务生成和文本到图像基准测试中表现与扩散模型持平甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量图像生成方法大多依赖于预训练组件或混合架构，限制了设计灵活性和使用自由，因此需要一种从零开始训练的模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了一个完全从头训练的纯解码器自回归模型，融合统一的标记化方案，可进行多种任务，包括图像生成、编辑和密集预测，同时引入高效的解码策略如推理时间缩放和Jacobi采样以提升质量和速度。

Result: 在文本-图像基准测试（如GenEval和DPG）中，Lumina-mGPT 2.0 的效果媲美并在某些情况下超越了扩散模型。此外，其多任务能力在Graph200K基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 是一个强大且灵活的基础生成模型，为统一的多模态生成提供了有力支持，并通过开源代码和模型为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了名为SV3.3B的轻量级视频理解模型，专注于运动视频分析，能够高效实现设备端部署，性能超过更大的模型如GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动视频分析方法难以捕捉细致的生物力学转换及重要动作阶段，同时对计算资源需求较高。

Method: SV3.3B采用了DWT-VGG16-LDA的关键帧提取方法，结合V-DWT-JEPA2的自监督预训练及LLM解码生成运动描述。

Result: 对NSVA篮球数据集子集的评估显示，SV3.3B在生成技术细节丰富的运动描述方面性能优越，比GPT-4o在验证指标上提升了29.2%。

Conclusion: SV3.3B提供了资源高效、性能优越的运动视频分析解决方案，可生成高质量的动作描述，并推动运动视频分析技术的发展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Detail++框架，通过分阶段生成策略和精准绑定技术改善复杂文本提示生成的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成技术在处理复杂提示（特别是包含多个主体和不同属性的情况）时存在挑战。

Method: 提出Progressive Detail Injection（PDI）策略，将复杂提示分解为简化的子提示并分阶段生成，同时引入重心对齐损失来减少测试时的绑定偏差。

Result: 通过实验表明，Detail++在多主体和复杂样式条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成和精确绑定解决了复杂文本提示生成中的挑战，效果显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FishDet-M，这是一个统一的鱼类检测基准，涵盖13个多样水生环境的数据集，通过一致的标注和评估提高了跨领域检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有水下鱼类检测数据集分散、图像条件多样、评估不一致的问题，推动水下计算机视觉的发展。

Method: 整合13个公开数据集，采用COCO风格标注，进行了28种主流检测模型的基准测试，并引入CLIP模型选择框架实现自适应模型选择。

Result: 测试展示了不同模型在FishDet-M上的检测性能，分析了精度与效率的权衡。CLIP框架实现了无集成计算的高效模型选择。

Conclusion: FishDet-M为复杂水域场景中的目标检测提供了标准化平台，并公开了所有数据集、预训练模型和评估工具，助力未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了利用生成型人工智能模型对黑色素瘤分类器公平性进行评估，验证了高真实性合成数据在此方向上的前景及相关挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习应用的边缘化，黑色素瘤等皮肤癌的筛查将受益。然而，潜在的偏差危险使得增强公平性成为关键任务。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用最先进的生成型AI模型LightningDiT，通过高真实性的合成数据，对现有公开的黑色素瘤分类模型的公平性进行评估。

Result: 研究发现，基于合成数据的公平性评估方向非常有前景，但分类模型数据集与合成图像数据集不一致时验证变得困难。

Conclusion: 提出一种新方法，通过合成数据评估和改善医疗图像生成AI系统的公平性，为相关领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) 的Transformer架构（DiNAT-IR），旨在提高图像修复任务的质量与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer的自注意力机制在图像修复中表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了在高分辨率图像上的应用。因此需要权衡效率与质量之间的研究。

Method: 作者采用DiNA的思想，结合通道自注意力和局部注意力机制，通过加入通道感知模块提升全局上下文理解，从而优化恢复效果。

Result: DiNAT-IR在多个基准评测中表现出竞争力，能够兼顾品质与多样需求的低层视觉问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DiNAT-IR架构通过平衡全局与局部注意力，为图像修复提供了高效高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR)的模块，用以改善无监督领域自适应语义分割(UDA-SS)的性能，特别是在复杂区域的分割精度上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的UDA-SS方法难以平衡精细局部细节与全局上下文信息，导致复杂区域出现分割误差。

Method: 引入适应性特征优化(AFR)模块，通过低分辨率特征的语义先验优化高分辨率特征。AFR模块还通过加入捕捉边界细节的高频成分并采用不确定性驱动的注意力机制，增强了局部和全局信息的平衡。该模块设计轻量，便于集成至HRDA框架。

Result: 在GTA V到Cityscapes任务中提升了1.05%的mIoU，在Synthia到Cityscapes任务中提升了1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: 通过AFR模块的引入，显著改进了UDA-SS方法的分割性能，并且易于部署，可达成最新的分割性能表现。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的数据集——OPEN，专注于老年人在虚拟学习会话中的参与度，并提供了AI驱动的参与度识别研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于参与度的研究主要聚焦于年轻人的学术环境，对老年人群体特别是在线心脏康复学习中的参与研究较少。此外，现有方法通常忽视了参与度的上下文相关性以及多会话的纵向特性。

Method: 研究团队收集了11位老年人参与为期6周、每周一次的虚拟小组学习课程的数据，共超过35小时。数据包含面部、手部、身体关节等特征，并标注了参与状态、情感和行为标签、上下文信息等。此外，训练了多个机器学习和深度学习模型以识别参与度，其中识别准确率最高达81%。

Result: 构建了一个名为OPEN的数据集，支持多种长度的样本分割，同时验证了AI模型在参与度识别中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该数据集为构建老年人个性化参与建模提供了可扩展的基础，并对更广泛的参与度识别研究作出了贡献。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于YOLO物体检测模型的自动化实时视频分析系统，用于观察爬宠物行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测胡须龙行为需要大量时间且容易出错，因此需要开发高效准确的自动化监测方法。

Method: 使用了五种YOLO模型（v5, v7, v8, v11, v12），通过分析自定义公共数据集（1200张图像）进行训练，并选择性能最佳的YOLOv8模型进行行为分类。

Result: 系统能够有效识别晒太阳行为，狩猎行为识别则因蟋蟀检测效果（mAP@0.5=0.392）不佳而受限。

Conclusion: 本系统极大地提高了数据收集效率，是监测受控环境下爬行动物行为的可扩展解决方案；未来将通过改进数据集或使用专门的小物体检测器来优化性能。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的跨模态人重识别数据集和模型框架，用于解决航拍与地面视角、RGB和红外模态下的识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的跨模态人重识别数据集集中于地面视角，但地面摄像头在夜间监控时常因遮挡和有限覆盖范围受限，而航拍角度可以解决这些问题。

Method: 提出AG-VPReID.VIR数据集（涵盖1,837名身份和124,855帧图像）以及一种名为TCC-VPReID的三流架构，用于风格鲁棒特征学习、跨视角自适应和时间动态建模。

Result: 在不同评估协议下，新数据集展现了独特的挑战性，而所提出的模型在性能上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了航拍与地面视角以及RGB-红外模态间的人员重识别研究空白，提供了有价值的资源和方法。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了医学影像数据集中标签偏差（label bias）对深度学习模型性能和学习特征的影响，重点研究了该效应与子组的相对大小及可分离性之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI系统的公平性正面临系统性标签错误问题的冲击，而当前针对标签偏差对特定子组的影响研究不足。本研究旨在填补这一空白，研究标签偏差对模型学习和性能的影响机制。

Method: 研究基于EMory BrEast imaging Dataset (EMBED) 数据集进行实验，利用深度学习模型进行二分类任务，模拟标签偏差对不同大小和可分离性子组的影响，并比较验证集是否有无干净标签对模型性能的影响。

Result: 研究结果显示标签偏差对模型学习特征空间的显著影响，其效应因子组的相对大小和可分离性而异。在验证集标签偏差的情形下，分类模型的子组性能出现明显下降（如TPR从0.898下降到0.518）。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了标签偏差对医学影像AI系统子组公平性的深远影响，标志性地为探索标签偏差的后果提供了基准依据。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [12] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的可优化代价函数，用于在刚体变换下优化Grassmannian特征间的距离度量，同时显著提升了相关计算机视觉任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能测量Grassmannian特征的接近度，但缺乏可优化的刚体变换距离函数，限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过数学证明提出了一种基于高维线性子空间基的显式表示，由此构建可优化的代价函数，并用于任意仿射子空间的配准问题。

Result: 提出的方法能直接最小化与表示无关的测地距离，相较于传统基于向量参数的方法，能找到全局最优解，并显著提升现有方法的收敛性与性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过优化Grassmannian特征间刚体变换距离解决了长期未解决的问题，并在多个计算机视觉任务中获得优势表现。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流的图文生成模型架构与大型语言模型(LMMs)相比仍然较为落后，需要更先进的架构设计。

Method: 提出了 GRR-CoCa 模型，结合了高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化以及旋转位置嵌入到文本解码器与视觉编码器中，同时进行了预训练和微调基准测试。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DeepFake视频种类多样，使用单一模型检测未知类型的DeepFake成为一大挑战，而现有数据集因伪造类型有限难以满足这一需求。

Method: 在现有Celeb-DF数据集的基础上，构建了Celeb-DF++，该数据集涵盖Face-swap、Face-reenactment和Talking-face三大伪造场景，包含22种不同的DeepFake生成方法，同时提出了评估协议用于检测方法的泛化能力分析。

Result: 通过Celeb-DF++评估了24种现有DeepFake检测方法的表现，证明现有方法在应对多样性DeepFake类型上存在的局限性及新数据集的挑战性。

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++数据集为DeepFake检测技术的泛化能力研究提供了一个强大且具有挑战性的基准，并表明当前检测方法在面对更多伪造类型时需进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的3D高斯填补框架，通过稀疏的填补视图实现完整3D场景重建，大幅提高了视觉质量和多视图一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对3D场景填补任务中由于3D结构不规则性和多视图一致性难以保持的问题。

Method: 框架引入自动化掩膜精炼和区域不确定性优化，利用高斯场景过滤、反向投影和不确定性评价方法，提升填补的准确性和细节保真度。

Result: 通过实验验证，该方法在视觉质量和视图一致性方面均超过了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出方法为多视图3D填补提供了更高效且一致的解决方案，推进了3D内容生成的性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGText 是一种新方法，利用视觉大语言模型(VLLM)与图神经网络(GNN)，增强了深度伪造检测的泛化性和鲁棒性，F1 分数提高至98.32%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁了媒体真实性，传统方法在应对复杂深度伪造时的泛化性和鲁棒性不足，因此需要一种更可靠的检测方法。

Method: 提出 ViGText 方法，将图像和文字解释以图形方式集成，通过 GNN 分析结合空域和频域多层级特征提取，检测深度伪造。

Result: 实验表明，ViGText 泛化性增强，平均 F1 分数从72.45%提升至98.32%；对定制化深度伪造检测表现优越，在鲁棒性测试中，相较于其他方法召回率提高11.1%，攻击下性能下降小于4%。

Conclusion: ViGText 利用视觉与文本详细分析，提升深度伪造检测水平，成为确保媒体真实性和信息完整性的先进工具。

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TAV数据集，提升多场景视频生成中的场景转换认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频在文本到视频上有较强表现，但较长视频的场景转换处理能力有限。

Method: 提出并使用包含多场景转换的TAV数据集训练模型。

Result: 改进了模型对提示场景转换的理解能力，缩小了生成和目标场景间的差距，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: TAV数据集提高了模型多场景生成质量，有助于更长且更复杂视频的生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Motivation: 解决现有方法因深度估计不准确在深度不连续处产生伪影的问题。

Result: 实现了高质量与高保真的结果。

Conclusion: 提出可扩展的真实感前景合成方法，兼顾真实性与场景多样性，优化了镜头模糊渲染技术。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Result: 在多个场景中，其性能在量化指标和感知质量上优于现代最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 新方法成功提升了结构保真度、语义一致性以及细节恢复能力，特别是在极端低光条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于文本驱动的轻量级分割模型TextSAM-EUS，用于提高胰腺超声图像分割精度，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌预后较差，现有EUS分割方法依赖大规模人工标注的数据集且易出错，因此需要改进分割方法以提高效率和精确性。

Method: 结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器的文本提示学习及基于LoRA的SAM架构适配，开发了TextSAM-EUS模型，只调整了0.86%的参数，支持自动及手动几何提示。

Result: 在EUS公开数据集中，自动提示下Dice达82.69%，NSD达85.28%，在手动提示下Dice达83.10%，NSD达85.70%，均优于现有SOTA模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS利用提示学习技术实现了高效、鲁棒的自动化EUS分割，是SAM在医学图像分割中的首次尝试，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在面对多源数据及个体表情差异导致的样本异质性时，性能会下降，需要新的方法解决。

Method: 提出异质性感知分布框架（HDF），包含时间频率分布注意模块（DAM）和分布感知缩放模块（DSM）。前者通过双分支注意力机制提升时间一致性和频率鲁棒性；后者基于梯度敏感性和信息瓶颈动态平衡分类与对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，HDF在DFEW和FERV39k数据集上显著提高了识别准确率和鲁棒性，尤其是WAR和UAR指标表现出色。

Conclusion: HDF验证了其综合改善动态表情识别能力，具有较强的泛化性及对不平衡场景的适应能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

planning applications. A case study of Hyderabad, India, illustrates
significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat

of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架—自由能后验网络，用于更加精确地检测分布外（OoD）样本和分类错误区域，同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如MC Dropout 无法同时捕捉模型和数据不确定性，进而无法精准服务于OoD检测的语义目标。

Method: 提出一种基于自由能的密度估计器，通过Beta分布参数化实现不确定性测量，并将该估计器加入后验网络，直接从参数中估计不确定性，无需随机采样。

Result: 整合到RPL框架中后，能超越传统的后处理能源阈值法，通过学习Beta分布的方差直接识别分布外区域，语义意义更强且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly和Segment-Me-If-You-Can等基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，为不确定性感知分割提供了高效而语义上有意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

Method: 提出了T2VWorldBench评估框架，覆盖6个主要类别、60个子类别和1200条提示，结合了人类偏好和基于视觉语言模型的自动化评估方法，对目前10个先进的文本到视频模型进行了评估。

Result: 研究发现，大部分现有模型无法充分理解世界知识，在生成语义一致和事实准确的视频方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前文本到视频模型尚无法有效利用世界知识，本研究揭示了其能力缺口，并为构建具备常识推理和事实生成能力的模型提供了研究方向和切入点。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双向扩散优化机制的新方法，用于解决低光图像增强中的实际退化问题并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单向扩散方法在处理复杂退化模式时存在局限，容易导致结构不一致和像素错位。

Method: 提出了双向扩散机制，结合从低光到正常光和从正常光到低光的路径训练，并引入了自适应特征交互模块(AFI)以改善特征表达，同时设计了反射感知修正模块(RACM)以引导去噪后颜色修复并抑制过曝光。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中优于现有方法，并能有效适应多样化退化场景。

Conclusion: 通过双向扩散机制和特征优化模块，模型能够更精确地匹配退化参数和提升图像生成质量，对低光图像增强有显著效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用RGB和红外图像的互补特性来提升目标检测能力，同时克服传统方法中的信息丢失问题。

Method: 通过离散小波变换将RGB和红外图像的频率成分分解，再融入WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB)，低频部分采用Mamba框架的频道交换和门控注意机制深度融合，高频部分采用“绝对最大值”融合策略，最后通过逆离散小波变换减少信息丢失。

Result: 提出的WaveMamba方法在4个基准数据集上较最先进方法平均提升mAP指标4.5%。

Conclusion: WaveMamba方法有效地融合了跨模态的频率特征，不仅在检测性能上优于现有方法，而且在多数据集测评中展现了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Object detection and classification are crucial tasks across various
application domains, particularly in the development of safe and reliable
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种无监督域适配(UDA)的两阶段框架，结合对比学习预训练和多模型伪标注策略，以在3D LiDAR语义分割中解决域转移问题，实验结果显示该方法显著提高了适配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D LiDAR语义分割在自动驾驶系统中至关重要，但因传感器类型和地理位置变化导致的域转移问题会降低性能，同时目标域手动标注成本高。

Method: 通过两阶段方法解决：第一阶段使用段级无监督对比学习进行骨干网络预训练，学习域不变特征；第二阶段通过多种架构模型结合硬投票伪标注目标域数据，生成高质量伪标签，然后用伪标签微调预训练网络。

Result: 从SemanticKITTI到无标注目标数据集(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic)的实验中，与直接传输和单模型UDA相比，该方法显著提高了分割准确率。

Conclusion: 结合对比学习预训练与精炼的伪标注，能有效消除复杂域间差异而无需目标域标注，证明其在域转移问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Diff-UMamba的新架构，结合了UNet框架和mamba机制，专注于在数据稀缺情况下提高医学图像分割的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在数据稀缺场景中容易过拟合，生成对噪声和不相关模式的依赖，限制其在未见样本上的泛化能力。此问题在医学图像分割中特别明显。

Method: Diff-UMamba结合了UNet框架和关注长距离依赖的mamba机制，并引入了一种噪声抑制模块（NRM），通过信号差分策略减少噪声或不相关激活，增强诊断相关特征。

Result: 在公共数据集（如MSD和AIIB23）上验证，与基线方法相比，分割任务性能提高了1-3%。在BraTS-21数据集中，通过调整可用训练样本比例验证，在稀少数据场景下效果大幅优化。在内部小数据集(NSCLC)中，其在分割任务上改进了4-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在应对低数据医学图像分割任务中提供了有效改进，具有很好的准确性与鲁棒性，特别是在具有噪声和数据限制的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

TL;DR: MatSSL 提出了一个简化的自监督学习框架，通过 Gated Feature Fusion 集成多层表示，并在小规模无监督数据上进行预训练后，在多个基准数据集上微调，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料显微图像分析主要依赖监督学习方法，需为每组新数据重新训练且在少量标注数据下表现不稳定；MatSSL 旨在克服这些限制并充分利用未标注数据，同时避免对大规模数据的依赖。

Method: MatSSL 在骨干网络中每一阶段利用 Gated Feature Fusion 集成多层特征；先基于小规模无监督数据进行自监督预训练，再在多个基准数据集上微调模型。

Result: MatSSL 在 MetalDAM 数据集上的分割性能达到 69.13% mIoU，超过 ImageNet 预训练编码器的 66.73%；在 EBC 数据集上比 MicroNet 预训练模型提升平均 mIoU 近 40%，表现出色。

Conclusion: MatSSL 无需大规模有标签数据即可通过小规模无标注数据完成自监督预训练，保留从自然图像大规模预训练中学到的丰富可转移特征，并出色适配金属显微图像领域。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

Motivation: 文本转图像生成方法的高质量生成依赖复杂采样策略和无分类器指导（CFG），但它带来了极高的推理成本。作者希望设计一种降低成本但又能维持效果的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种新型蒸馏方法TeEFusion，它通过线性操作融合条件和无条件文本嵌入来重新构建指导，并让学生模型通过学习教师模型输出以提升效率。

Result: 实验在SD3等最新模型上验证，学生模型在推理速度提升最高达6倍的情况下，生成图像质量与教师模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了推理复杂性，同时保留了高质量输出，并为高效文本转图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 针对医学影像分割任务中传统扩散模型特性提取不足和直接转移原始训练过程的问题，提出专门的改进方法。

Method: 设计了一种基于潜在扩散模型的LEAF医学影像分割模型，通过替换原始噪声预测为直接分割图预测，减少结果方差，并结合特征蒸馏方法对齐卷积层隐状态与基于transformer的视觉特征。

Result: 实验证明LEAF模型在不同疾病类型的多个分割数据集上提高了扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF方法在精度和效率上优异，不改变模型架构，也不增加推理阶段的参数和计算量，具有应用前景。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

Motivation: 解决3D点云不规则和无序结构对测试时自适应方法的阻碍，提高适配效率并减少计算成本。

Method: 采用图傅里叶变换将点云转化为图谱域，优化低频分量并通过逆变换重构点云，结合特征自学习策略动态调整模型参数。

Conclusion: GSDTTA是一种高效的3D点云测试时自适应方法，在捕捉全局结构特性和模型性能提升方面效果显著。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Conclusion: DATA网络在特征域对齐和时间对齐方面改进了协同感知的性能，为高效鲁棒的特征级融合提供了一种先进方法。

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Conclusion: DepthDark模型专为低光单目深度估计设计，通过创新的数据集生成方法和调优策略，在低光环境下展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Conclusion: LONG3R突破现有多视图三维重建方法在流处理上的限制，可在长序列中实现高效重建，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 利用两样本孟德尔随机化研究，发现龋齿与肺癌有显著因果关系，而牙周炎无明显影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨龋齿和牙周炎与肺癌的潜在因果关系是否成立，并评估肺功能在其中的中介作用。

Method: 使用两样本孟德尔随机化方法，通过观察多个大规模基因组关联研究的数据，并结合逆方差加权和Delta方法分析因果关系及中介机制。

Result: 龋齿显著增加肺癌及其亚型的风险，且部分通过肺功能降低中介；牙周炎未显示显著因果关系。

Conclusion: 龋齿与肺癌风险存在因果关系，需将口腔护理和肺功能监测整合进癌症预防策略中。

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Conclusion: LMM-Det方法有效填补了LMMs对象检测能力的空白，并提供了开源数据集、模型及代码供研究者使用。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架FieldLVLM，用于改进大规模视觉-语言模型对科学领域数据的理解，尤其是解释复杂的现场数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模视觉-语言模型在视觉和文本综合任务中表现出色，但其在科学领域尤其是对自然科学中复杂现场数据的应用还未被充分探索。

Method: FieldLVLM框架包括两部分：领域感知语言生成策略和数据压缩的多模态模型调优。前者通过专用机器学习管道提取现场数据的关键物理特征并生成结构化文本描述，后者则通过数据压缩策略简化字段输入以提高模型的解码兼容性和学习效果。

Result: 实验证明，FieldLVLM在科学领域数据任务上显著优于现有方法，新提出的基准数据集进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模视觉-语言模型在科学研究中的应用开辟了新途径，有助于缩小大模型与领域特定发现间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Result: 实验结果表明，transformer在半监督心电图分割中表现优于卷积网络，跨领域和领域内设定均得到验证。

Conclusion: 该基准有望推动半监督心电图分割方法的发展，为该领域进一步研究提供支持。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理数据的局部信息和全局低秩性时往往需要进行权衡，而作者希望设计一种无需权衡的统一方法。

Method: 提出修改核范数（MNN）框架，通过适当变换矩阵并在转换后的矩阵上应用传统核范数，捕捉局部和全局属性。

Result: MNN可以在符合一定假设的转换下，在鲁棒PCA和矩阵补全任务中实现精确恢复，并通过实验证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: MNN框架具有通用性和灵活性，为结构化低秩恢复问题提供了一种统一且高效的方法。

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Motivation: 现有的物理模型虽然能够估计尾迹云对气候的影响，但受限于大气输入数据的质量及尾迹云形成、持续时间等复杂过程的假设。此外，现有观测数据缺少时间跟踪，也无法将尾迹云与其来源航班进行关联。

Method: 本研究开发了GVCCS数据集，包括122段视频（共24,228帧），为每段尾迹云提供详细标注和时间追踪，并关联了飞行标识符。此外，提出了深度学习框架，采用全景分割模型，在单一架构中实现语义分割、实例分割和时间跟踪功能。

Conclusion: 研究为更准确理解和评估航空对气候的影响奠定了基础，将推动尾迹云的进一步研究及其影响的量化分析。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SGCDet的新型多视图室内3D目标检测框架，基于自适应3D体素构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中体素的感受野被限制在图像的固定位置，无法动态整合几何与上下文信息。因此需要一种能够自适应提升特征表示能力的方案。

Method: SGCDet采用几何与上下文感知的自适应聚合模块，同时提出了一种自适应稀疏体素构建策略，通过选择高占用概率的体素进行特征优化。

Result: 通过实验表明，SGCDet在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上达到了当前最优表现。

Conclusion: SGCDet框架改进了体素构建的有效性与效率，同时减少了对场景几何的依赖，仅需要3D边界框就可进行监督。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鸟类鸣声的分类任务因环境噪声、多重重叠声音和缺失标签而具有挑战性，现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中表现有限。

Method: 作者通过将频率信息嵌入声谱图，并使用主要颜色添加法进行颜色化，提升物种区分度，从而改进深度学习模型对声谱图的分类效果。

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法显著优于未颜色化的模型，F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP指标分别提升7.3%、6.2%和6.6%。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化的方式嵌入频率信息可以有效提高鸟类鸣声分类的准确性，这一方法优于当前最优模型。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够在第一视角和第三视角之间传递和整合知识，这种能力对跨视角推理至关重要。然而，目前的多模态大语言模型在此方面能力尚未探索，因此需要一个基准来测试这一能力。

Method: 构建了EgoExoBench测试集，包括7300多个问题和答案，围绕三个核心挑战：语义对齐、视角关联和时序推理，对13种最先进的多模态大语言模型进行了评估。

Result: 评估结果表明，尽管这些模型在单一视角任务上表现较好，但在跨视角语义对齐、视角关联以及时序推理方面仍存在困难。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench可为研究具备类人跨视角推理能力的智能体和智能助手提供重要工具与资源。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Conclusion: 新模块增强了模型的表示和泛化能力，具有通用性，适用于其他具有复杂全球自相似特征的视觉任务。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

Conclusion: MVG4D为从极少信息输入生成高质量4D内容提供了一种高效且可控的方法，具有进一步应用AR/VR领域的潜力。

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SynC的新框架，用于通过重新分配标题到语义对齐的图像来改进合成图像标题数据集，从而提升零次图像标题生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像(T2I)模型生成合成数据集时图像和标题语义不匹配的问题，从而改进零次图像标题生成的表现。

Method: 提出一个名为SynC的框架，采用一对多的映射策略，先为每个标题检索多个候选图像，然后通过灵感来源于循环一致性的对齐评分方法选择语义上最匹配的图像，而不是直接过滤或重新生成标题。

Result: 在广泛评估中，通过多个标准数据集（MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps）验证，SynC显著提升了各种零次图像标题生成模型的性能，在多个场景下达到了当前最优结果。

Conclusion: SynC显著改进了合成数据的质量，为零次图像标题生成提供了一个有效的优化策略，表明在图像标题生成中的重要应用前景。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于物理渲染的全身逆向渲染方法，能够实现高质量材料估计，特别在皮肤渲染方面具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆向渲染方法使用的简化材料数据和渲染方程导致了渲染结果（尤其是皮肤渲染）真实性不足，因此需要一个高质量的数据集和改进的模型方法。

Method: 通过构建高质量数据集OpenHumanBRDF和提出名为HumanMaterial的进阶模型解决逆向渲染中材料估计问题，包括引入新增的材质信息如位移和次表面散射，以及运用逐步训练策略并设计CPR损失增强方法。

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和真实数据上进行广泛实验，证明该方法建立了材料估计的最新性能基准。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法改进了全身人像的逆向渲染，特别在皮肤渲染效果和整体真实感上达到了较好的水平。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Swin Transformer中需要两层才能近似全局注意力的局限性，提出一种能在单模块内实现全局信息交换的新方法。

Method: 结合创新的交错窗口注意力和深度可分卷积，移除位置嵌入，直接在低到高分辨率间进行微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K图像分类中达到87.4%的Top-1准确率，也在语义分割和视频动作识别等任务中表现出色。核心组件在条件图像生成中也显示出优越性。

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer通过高效的模块设计实现全局和局部信息整合，在多个视觉任务上展现了强大的竞争力，具有推动相关领域研究的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于医学图像分割的创新网络DCFFSNet，通过分离并动态平衡多尺度连接特征的方法，显著提升了分割性能和边缘光滑度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度网络在引入拓扑连接特性时存在特征空间耦合，并且缺乏量化不同特征强度的机制。该研究旨在解决这些问题并提升医学图像分割精度。

Method: 提出了DCFFSNet网络，采用了特征空间解耦策略，量化连接特征与其他特征的相对强度，并动态平衡多尺度特征表达，同时设计了连接特征融合与分离架构。

Result: 在ISIC2018、DSB2018和MoNuSeg数据集上的实验证明，DCFFSNet在多个评估指标上均优于主流方法，例如在Dice和IoU指标上分别超越最佳对比模型1.3%和1.2%。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet有效解决了分割中的碎片化问题，同时实现了平滑的边缘过渡，其性能优于现有主流方法，对临床应用具有显著意义。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了V-JEPA框架对超声视频图像分割的潜力，通过加入3D辅助任务进一步提升了小数据集环境下的表现，显示出对医疗成像领域的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Conclusion: 方法在多种基准数据集上实现了领先性能，为移动机器人视觉定位提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: PDB-Eval基准和任务设计显著提升了MLLMs在驾驶领域的推理与理解能力，同时保留了其通用性，为驾驶安全和辅助系统提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架不仅推动了对抗性研究的规范化，还深化了对LiDAR系统对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御机制主要采取被动策略，难以适应动态3D环境中的攻击。

Method: 构建Rein-EAD框架，利用多步目标和不确定性奖励机制，提升防御策略的适应性和效率。

Result: 实验表明Rein-EAD显著降低了攻击成功率，并在多种任务中保持了模型的标准准确性，同时对未知攻击表现出良好的泛化性。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD为在现实场景中应用的3D视觉防御提供了新方向，兼顾了实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究受生物启发的注意力计算模型以改进视觉任务中的人类扫描路径预测。

Method: 将语义化的深度目标检测与概率语义融合机制相结合，通过人工中央凹化生成动态注意力图，并利用预训练检测器更新顶部知识以改进注视点预测。

Conclusion: 语义-中央凹化概率框架能有效模拟类人注意力，具有实时认知计算和机器人领域的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Conclusion: 该研究验证了跨多个模型和模态共享特征的重要性，尤其是多模态上下文训练对视觉和文本特征共享的促进作用。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly

application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D语义占用预测在自动驾驶中至关重要，然而现有方法受限于密集网格表示的内存和速度限制，且对传感器融合的依赖方式不足以利用多个模态的互补信息。

Method: 采用3D高斯表示以提高效率，并通过模态无关的变形注意机制从相机、LiDAR和雷达中提取关键特征，使它们进一步优化高斯属性，改进环境表示。

Result: 在实验中整合不同传感器组合，结果显示GaussianFusionOcc相比现有技术具有更高的准确性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过结合多模态融合的鲁棒性和高斯表示的效率，GaussianFusionOcc提升了3D语义占用预测的性能，是一种更精确和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: IntentVCNet显著强化了LVLM在时空序列中的意图控制能力，取得了优秀的实验和竞赛成果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型固定为高斯噪声，这种限制会恶化退化图像并增加修复复杂性。

Method: 提出EDA框架，允许任意噪声模式，理论证明在不增加计算开销的情况下保留EDM模块的灵活性。

Result: 在MRI偏场校正、CT金属伪影减少、自然图像影子去除三项任务中，EDA均表现出色，且在部分任务中超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: EDA以灵活的噪声设计推动了扩散模型在图像修复领域的卓越表现。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效整合预训练MVS先验和概率映射策略，解决大规模多图像无位姿重建中的关键挑战，并提供在时间和精度上的双重优势。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme

Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating

achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过改进年龄和性别分类的精度，为定向广告提供更有用的信息。

Method: 设计了一种优化的卷积神经网络（CNN）架构，让模型同时学习两项任务的共享特征，并对数据进行了光照、姿态和图像质量的处理，确保鲁棒性。

Result: 性别分类准确率达到了95%，年龄估算的平均绝对误差为5.77年，并揭示了年轻人群年龄估算的困难。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅证明了共享表示学习的有效性，还提出了数据增强和模型细化的具体需求，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Scenethesis的新方法，用于从用户需求生成三维软件，解决了现有方法难以实现细粒度修改和复杂约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前3D软件生成方法无法满足细粒度修改和复杂空间语义约束的需求，而2D软件生成的成功激发了在3D领域探索自动化生成的需求。

Method: 通过定义ScenethesisLang作为领域特定语言，建立用户需求与3D软件生成之间的中间表示，并将生成过程分解为多个阶段以支持约束验证和针对性修改。

Result: 该方法在用户需求捕捉率和约束满足率上分别超过80%和90%，并在视觉评估得分方面比现有方法提高42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis为生成可控和需求敏感的3D软件提供了一种有效的解决方案，同时显著提升了性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，通过分解人脸合成图像以还原原始面部图像，并克服了现有方法在未知合成技术和面部风格下的适应性不足问题。相较于现有方法，本文方法显著提升了去伪造的性能与图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过人脸合成技术，单一伪造图像可与多个身份产生生物识别关联，而现有检测方法虽能发现伪造却无法提供原图信息，这引发了对高效还原技术的研究需求。

Method: 方法采用潜在空间分解技术，与现有方法不同，其对用未知技术或不同风格生成的伪造图像具有更广泛的适应性。在训练中使用合成数据，而测试基于真实数据。

Result: 在实验中，提出的方法在识别伪造原始图像时，优于现有方法，且生成的图像具有高保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法解决了现有方法对生成技术与风格适应性差的问题，并提高了去伪造图像的真实性和准确性，在相关任务中显示了显著改进。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SIDA的零样本领域适应方法，利用合成图像代替文本描述，并通过域混合和补丁风格迁移模块提升适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的零样本领域适应方法在处理复杂的真实世界变动时表现较差，同时对齐过程耗时显著，需要探索使用更丰富和细粒度的图像风格线索的解决方案。

Method: SIDA通过生成合成图像，先创建类似来源域的图像，然后应用图像转换反映目标域风格。采用这些合成图像的风格特征作为目标域的代理，并引入域混合和补丁风格迁移模块来增强真实世界变动的建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，SIDA方法在多种零样本领域适应场景中特别是在复杂的目标域中实现了最先进的效果，同时显著减少了适应时间。

Conclusion: SIDA方法通过利用合成图像代替文本描述，同时结合域混合和补丁风格迁移模块，既实现了高性能又提升了效率，为零样本领域适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM)的新框架，用于解决传统DMD方法中依赖反KL散度最小化可能导致模式崩溃的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMD在将教师扩散模型压缩为高效的学生生成器时，可能因反KL散度最小化而诱发模式崩溃问题，因此需要一种新的方法解决这种固有缺陷。

Method: 提出一种基于对抗的分布匹配方法，即采用扩散-基鉴别器对真实与虚假得分估计器之间的潜在预测进行对齐。同时，结合混合鉴别器在潜在和像素空间上进行对抗蒸馏，并加入基于ODE对的分布损失以改进初始预训练。

Result: 实验表明，结合ADM微调和对抗蒸馏预训练的统一流程（DMDX）在SDXL上的单步性能优于DMD2，且在多步扩散如SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large和CogVideoX中实现了新的基准。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对抗蒸馏和ADM微调显著提升了图像和视频生成的效率，是传统DMD方法的有效改进。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合Transformer和Mamba的混合架构HybridTM，用于3D语义分割，并在多项基准测试中表现优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在3D语义分割中表现出色，但计算复杂度高，而Mamba在特征提取方面表现不足，研究致力于结合两者优势。

Method: 提出HybridTM混合架构，以及在内部层级结合注意力机制和Mamba的Hybrid策略，同时捕获远程依赖性和局部细节。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes数据集上取得了最佳性能，并展现了良好的综合性。

Conclusion: HybridTM展现了融合Transformer和Mamba优点的潜力，为3D语义分割任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Motivation: 目标是建立一个基准，用于从图像识别生成提示中所调用的艺术家名字，从而支持负责任的文本到图像模型的使用。

Method: 提供了一个包含195万张图片、涵盖110位艺术家的数据集，并设计了四种泛化设置。对比研究了多种模型方法，如特征相似性、对比风格描述、数据归因方法等，以及监督分类器和少样本原型网络。

Result: 发现监督及少样本模型对已知艺术家和复杂提示具有优异表现，而风格描述在艺术家风格鲜明时表现更佳。多艺术家提示泛化效果更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了当前生成模型在艺术家识别任务上的改进空间，并提供基础测试环境以支持后续研究进展。

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Motivation: 旨在解决多场景长叙事电影的生成问题，同时确保整体情节和视觉效果的连贯性，以支持高效高质量的短片创作。

Method: 提出了一个分两步的框架：1）从上而下规划关键帧，以保证长程情境的连贯性；2）结合多模态扩散Transformer，通过底层视频合成生成两帧间动态内容，还引入了一种用于处理长时间上下文的交替训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，Captain Cinema在生成视觉一致性和叙事连贯性的高质量短片方面表现优异，并具有较高的生成效率。

Conclusion: Captain Cinema通过规划关键帧和高效训练策略，展示了其在多场景电影制作中具备实用性和技术优势。

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望超越现有模型生成推理的能力限制，提升大语言模型在在线购物环境中模拟真实人类行为的表现。

Method: 引入Shop-R1框架，包括两个阶段：推理生成和行动预测。推理生成使用模型内部信号进行自监督控制；行动预测用分层奖励结构与难度感知缩放机制评估动作类型与子动作细节。

Result: 实验显示，相比基线方法，所提方法实现了超过65%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习和分阶段设计，提升大语言模型推理与行为预测能力，可更好地模拟在线购物中人类行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在跨领域泛化能力不足和静态评估标准适应性差的问题。

Method: 通过动态选择奖励信号和引入奖罚对的帕累托优越性估计，设计了支持细粒度多维奖励标准的奖励树方法。

Result: 实验表明DG-PRM能显著提升模型性能，尤其在分布外场景具有很好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM为复杂任务中利用稠密奖励信号指导LLM提供了一种高效且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting

key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.

than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025

architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted

  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing

Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的推理一致性，测试其在证据更新时是否更符合贝叶斯定理。

Method: 提出贝叶斯一致系数（BCC）作为衡量指标，生成数据集并对多种模型的表现进行比较分析。

Result: 实验结果支持假设：较大且更强的预训练语言模型在贝叶斯一致性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 实验结果增强了对语言模型行为和监管的理解，表明模型规模和能力与其一致性相关。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究提出了NeuralDB，一种高效编辑大型语言模型内知识的新方法，通过神经键值数据库实现高效编辑和保留模型整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Locate-and-Edit方法尽管可以同时修改大量事实，但扩展到上千次编辑时可能会损害模型的通用能力，并遗忘已经修改的内容。本研究的动机是解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将Locate-and-Edit方法建模为查询键值数据库，并提出NeuralDB框架，使用神经键值数据库和非线性门控检索模块来编辑知识，同时保留模型的通用性能。

Result: 在ZsRE和CounterFacts数据集上进行了涉及10,000个事实编辑的实验，展示了NeuralDB在编辑效率、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性上的优越性。此外，其效果在扩展到100,000个事实时仍然保持，显著超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDB是一种有效的知识编辑框架，显著提高了大模型的知识编辑能力，同时在多个文本处理任务中保持了卓越性能。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS是在推理时通过调整语言和视觉语言模型中前馈传播的网络激活值来实现模型行为控制的方法，无需更新模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前推理时改造模型行为的方法存在一些局限，如依赖固定干预向量、忽视特定输入的因果影响以及未能充分利用梯度信息等。GrAInS旨在突破这些限制。

Method: GrAInS使用基于Integrated Gradients的对比梯度归因来识别影响模型决策的关键输入tokens，构造相应的方向性调整向量，并在推理时动态调整隐藏层的激活值。

Result: 在多项任务中，GrAInS优于微调和其他现有改造方法。例如，在TruthfulQA上准确率提升13.22%，在MMHal-Bench上幻觉率降低到0.514，以及在SPA-VL对齐能力上提高了8.11%。

Conclusion: GrAInS实现了无监督、高效的细粒度模型行为控制，并保持了模型的流畅性和通用性能，展现了显著优越性。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注的方法，以减少人工标注的需求及成本，并验证其在语音领域的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有短语断句预测方法依赖于大量人工标注数据，且语音领域的固有变异性使得获得高质量数据具有挑战性，亟需解决此问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成合成短语断句标注数据，与传统标注进行对比，并在多种语言中测试其有效性。

Result: 通过实验发现，基于LLM的合成数据生成方法能够有效解决短语断句预测中的数据挑战问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLM生成的合成数据可以作为一种可行的解决方案，用于语音领域的短语断句预测问题。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Method: 提出了一套全面的指标对合成数据的多样性（如语言表达、情感和用户视角）及隐私性（如重识别风险和风格离群性）进行量化评估，并基于评估结果设计了一种基于提示的方法优化数据生成。

Result: 实验表明，现有大语言模型在生成多样性高且隐私性强的合成数据方面存在重大局限。提出的提示方法显著提高了合成评论的多样性，同时保护了评论者隐私。

Conclusion: 尽管大语言模型作为生成合成数据的工具具有潜力，但目前其在多样性和隐私性方面尚存不足，通过设计合理的提示可以一定程度上缓解这些问题。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLM评估基准侧重于模型处理复杂任务的能力，但缺乏对现实对话场景下交互能力的关注，因此需要一个动态基准来更好地评价模型的实用性。

Method: 设计TELEVAL基准，包括三大评估维度：显性语义、超语言及隐性语义和系统能力，采用一致于真实场景的对话形式，分别对文本和音频输出进行评估。

Result: 通过实验表明，尽管SLMs取得了一定进展，但在自然对话任务中仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL具备以用户为中心的评估框架，可以反映用户实际体验，有助于促进更强大对话式SLMs的发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Result: 新方法在GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench和HumanEval四个基准测试中表现优异，达到接近全模型微调的精度，同时训练时间减少2.1倍，内存使用降低50%。

Conclusion: 提出的混合策略为资源受限环境下的大语言模型微调提供了实际且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Motivation: 由于2014年版的GloVe模型缺乏详细文档且语言环境变化，需要新版模型以满足当前需求。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword以及Dolma子集训练两组词嵌入模型。

Result: 新模型在词汇测试和NER任务上表现出文化和语言的相关性，同时在结构任务（例如类比与相似性）表现稳定，对时间相关的NER数据集表现较好。

Conclusion: 新版GloVe模型综合表现较强，适应了现代语言和语境需求，同时填补了旧版模型文档不完整的缺憾。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型对语音的关注仅限于文字语义，忽略了诸如方言、年龄、情感和非语言声学等信息，因此有必要设计更全面的模型。

Method: 引入了双模态头部架构，将语言和语音的模型分离，同时通过逐步对齐语言学和声学特征的分阶段模块化训练策略，提升模型效率和适应性。

Result: 在多维评测基准TELEVAL上取得了良好的语义及非语义任务性能，并优于现有开源模型，特别在情感、方言和年龄敏感交互上表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM证明了超越单纯语义内容建模的必要性，加速了自然、自适应及社会感知语音交互系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在代码支持的多模态数学推理中的能力，通过两个关键评估任务——多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE），进行模型性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型主要关注文字推理能力，对其通过代码执行视觉操作的能力缺乏系统评估，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计一个评估框架，专注于多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE），并结合五种常见数学图形数据集，对模型的生成和微调操作能力进行全面分析。

Result: 实验涉及九种主流MLLMs，结果表明，这些模型在精细化的视觉操作能力上显著落后于人类表现。

Conclusion: 目前MLLMs在多模态数学推理中的代码支持操作能力仍有很大提升空间，需进一步改进以接近人类水平。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在支持临床医生日常决策中的潜力日益显现，却存在精确性、潜在危害性及临床接受度的担忧，研究试图探讨LLMs如何安全有效地应用于复杂的HIV管理。

Method: 研究引入了HIVMedQA基准数据集，并评估了七个通用及三个医学专用LLMs，通过提示工程提升其表现，设计了综合评估框架（包括词汇相似性和LLM判定方法）衡量模型在问题理解、推理、知识召回等多个维度的能力。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估LLMs，以确保其在临床护理中的安全和有效整合。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨Transformer文本嵌入模型中的“黏性”tokens对模型性能的影响，并提出了一种名为Sticky Token Detector（STD）的检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型中因“黏性”tokens导致的文本嵌入不可靠性问题。

Method: 通过设计Sticky Token Detector（STD）方法进行token筛选和句子过滤，将问题系统化地分析，并测试其对40个检查点和14种模型的影响。

Result: 发现868个“黏性”tokens，这些token会显著影响任务性能（如聚类和检索性能），并对内部表示产生不成比例的统治性影响。

Conclusion: 需要改进token化策略和模型设计，以减少“黏性”tokens对文本嵌入的负面影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过估计模型位置偏差并重新分配答案位置来缓解多选任务中的选择偏差，同时避免答案与相似选项邻近，从而提升评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估可能因LLM利用选项位置或标签偏差而导致虚高评分，需要设计能公平地评估模型理解能力的方法。

Method: 引入SCOPE框架，通过空白提示来估计模型的偏差分布，重分答案位，并避免答案与相似选项邻近。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE相比现有消偏方法表现更佳，并展现出较为清晰的正确答案置信分布。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提高LLM评测的公平性和可靠性提供了新的标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要一个框架确保工作效率以及与战略目标的对齐，同时需要结合新的ISO30401知识管理体系标准，来更好地管理和整合流程。

Method: 文章使用了ISO30401与ISO9001结合的过程建模原则，同时采用了SECI模型机制与PDCA循环的步骤来实施知识管理系统。

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

TL;DR: 使用外部知识增强语言模型（RAG）可能导致安全风险，作者提出了一种名为GMTP的防御方法，能够检测并过滤恶意文档，有效保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中的安全问题，即通过外部知识基注入恶意文档危害生成过程的准确性。

Method: 提出了一种称为GMTP的防御方法，使用梯度分析识别关键高影响力的标记，并通过掩码语言模型验证其概率，以检测恶意文档。

Result: GMTP能过滤掉超过90%的恶意内容，同时保持高相关文档的留存，确保检索和生成的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GMTP方法有效防御了针对RAG模型的恶意文档攻击，既提升安全性又维护了模型性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了指令调节如何影响大语言模型（LLMs）对用户错误信息的敏感性，发现指令调节增加了模型对用户错误信息的接受倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究指令调节如何提升LLM的可用性同时潜在增加其对错误信息的依赖风险，重点探索其对误导性信息接受度的影响。

Method: 通过实验对比指令调节模型与基础模型，研究对错误信息的接受度，分析提示结构、信息长度和系统预警对敏感性的影响。

Result: 指令调节模型显著更易接受用户提供的错误信息，与基础模型相比更依赖用户输入；敏感性受提示结构、信息长度和预警模块明显影响。

Conclusion: 指令调节需要系统性改进以降低其负面影响，在真实应用中强化LLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Prune&Comp是一个层修剪的新方法，通过补偿机制在无需训练的情况下减小隐藏层输出的幅度差距，从而提升修剪后模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层修剪方法在提升大型语言模型加速的同时，会因为隐藏层幅度差距带来性能下降，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp方法：在线性估算幅度差距后，通过离线重新调整剩余权重，且无运行时开销；结合迭代剪枝策略增强修剪指标。

Result: 以LLaMA-3-8B模型为例，修剪五层后，该方法在主流修剪指标基础上可将困惑度减少近一半，并使模型的问答性能保留93.19%，比基准提升4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp在无需训练的情况下提高了层修剪精度，为大型语言模型压缩和加速提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Motivation: 尽管OCR在高资源语言（如英语）上的应用已较为成熟，但对于使用独特文字的低资源语言仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 对6种OCR引擎（包括商业和开源系统）的性能进行比较研究，使用五种测量方法在字符和词级评估其准确性，同时还引入新的合成泰米尔语OCR基准数据集。

Result: Surya在僧伽罗语测试中表现最佳（WER为2.61%），而Document AI在泰米尔语中的表现最好（CER为0.78%）。

Conclusion: 不同OCR系统在处理低资源语言中的表现具有显著差异，且合成数据集的引入有助于进一步研究。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏指令-响应格式，难以在不影响指令遵从性的情况下为企业通信提供定制的风格特性。

Method: StyleAdaptedLM框架采用LoRA适配器，先通过未结构化风格语料库对基础模型进行训练，并将训练出的适配器与独立的指令遵循模型合并。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集和模型上能够提高风格一致性，同时保持对指令的忠实遵从，并通过人工评估验证了品牌特定约定的吸收效果。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs的风格个性化提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Method: 通过一种数据中毒方法，使用可调触发器控制推理步骤的冗长程度。同时，利用教师 LLM 定制生成包含受控冗余推理步骤的训练数据，以不影响答案正确性的方式实现攻击。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法可在多个 LRM 上稳定触发推理过程显著冗长化，且不降低答案正确性，有效进行资源消耗型攻击。

Conclusion: 提出的可调控过度思考后门攻击方法对依赖复杂推理能力的模型构成了潜在威胁，未来需要更完善的防御机制来降低此类风险。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

Motivation: 分析当前机器翻译模型在性别信息不明时是否能体现适当的不确定性，同时检验去偏策略对不同情境下翻译效果的独立影响。

Method: 借助最新的语义不确定性指标评估模型表现，针对明确性别与不明确性别两种情况进行实验分析，并测试去偏策略的效果。

Result: 发现当前模型即使在明确性别翻译准确性高的情况下，在性别不明确的情境下却未能表现出预期的不确定性；而去偏策略对不同性别翻译实例的效果各自独立。

Conclusion: 机器翻译模型在处理性别不明确翻译时需更好地处理不确定性，同时去偏技术需要针对不同情况进行更细致设计。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

Conclusion: TDR是一种易于结合不同LLM的插拔式方法，可有效提高ICL示例检索能力，对多任务问题表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

*Giorgos Iacovides,Wuyang Zhou,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个专为金融领域设计的大语言模型框架FinDPO，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)进行人类偏好对齐，显著提升了金融情感分析效果，同时还能在真实交易策略中提供显著收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前生成式AI技术下基于监督微调的模型面临训练数据记忆化和泛化能力不足问题，尤其在需要应对未见事件和特定领域复杂语言的金融应用中成为关键限制。

Method: 文章提出了FinDPO框架，采用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法对金融领域的LLM进行后训练调优，并通过“logit-to-score”转换将离散的情感预测转化为连续的可排序情感分数，从而能在实际投资策略中应用。

Result: FinDPO在标准情感分类基准上平均表现超越现有监督微调模型11%，并在模拟中实现了每年67%的显著正收益，同时保持强大的2.0夏普比率，即使在5个基点的交易成本条件下表现仍稳健。

Conclusion: FinDPO不仅在情感分析中取得了卓越表现，还通过创新的方法实现了情感分析结果与投资应用的连接，是金融领域情感分析的重要突破。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

### [127] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出AraTable，一种用于评估大语言模型在阿拉伯语表格数据上的推理和理解能力的新基准测试，涉及问题回答、事实验证和复杂推理等多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语表格数据资源稀缺和现有大语言模型在其上的表现局限性问题。

Method: 通过混合管道生成测试数据，初始内容由大语言模型生成，并由人工专家过滤和验证，以确保数据质量，同时提出了基于自我审议机制的自动化评估框架。

Result: 发现大语言模型在简单问题上表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证方面仍有显著挑战，表明未来在复杂表格推理任务上有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个有效的公开资源和评估框架，有助于促进处理和分析阿拉伯语结构化数据的基础模型的发展。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Conclusion: 本文为孟加拉语标点恢复奠定了稳固的基线，并公开了数据集和代码以支持未来的低资源NLP研究。

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床NLP中的稀疏性和隐私问题，系统性分析合成医疗文本文献的主要动机。

Method: 对多种数据库进行筛选，最终选定94篇文献，通过定量分析研究三个问题：生成目的、技术以及评估方法。

Result: 自2018年起合成医疗文本研究增长显著，主要用于文本增强、辅助写作、语料建设、隐私保护等。采用GPT为主的Transformer架构技术，评估集中在相似性、隐私性、结构性和效用性四个方面。

Conclusion: 合成医疗文本可作为真实医疗文档的有用补充，有助于提升精度及解决数据稀疏问题。尽管如此，隐私问题仍是主要挑战，需要更多人工评估和优化。未来其发展将加速工作流整合及流程开发。

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过图引导学习特征依赖的新方法GraDe，用于增强LLM在稀疏特征依赖表格数据上的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在处理稀疏特征依赖的表格数据中因注意力机制导致关键关系关注度稀释的问题。

Method: 提出GraDe方法，通过外部提取的功能依赖信息指导轻量级动态图学习模块，将这些图信息集成到LLM的注意力机制中，以增强对关键特征交互的建模能力。

Result: 实验证明，GraDe在复杂数据集上相比现有方法性能提高了最多12%，同时在合成数据质量上表现接近于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: GraDe方法在结构感知表格数据建模上是一种实用且高效的解决方案，能够在提升表现的同时保持低干预性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

  Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false
negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt
engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning
remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.

a novel approach designed to handle nested named entities while integrating

mitigates annotation gaps by dynamically adjusting loss computation to avoid

of the model's predictions, SRU-NER achieves competitive performance in
biomedical and general-domain NER tasks, while improving cross-domain
generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型混合分词策略，通过结合6-mer分词和BPE-600来提升DNA语言模型（DLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统k-mer分词在处理DNA序列时面临的局限性，如不均匀的标记分布和对全局序列上下文理解的不足。

Method: 采用混合分词策略，将独特的6mer标记与通过600个BPE循环生成的BPE标记相结合，制造平衡且具备上下文感知能力的词汇表。利用该词汇表训练了一个基础DLM模型，并在next-k-mer预测任务上进行了评估。

Result: 模型实现了3-mer、4-mer、5-mer的预测准确率分别为10.78%、10.1%和4.12%，明显优于现有的最先进模型（如NT、DNABERT2和GROVER）。

Conclusion: 指出混合分词策略在保留DNA局部序列结构和全球上下文信息上的优势，强调高级分词方法对基因组语言建模的重要性，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）在质量和速度上的权衡问题，并提出了一种无需训练的解码算法WINO来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DLLMs在快速并行解码中存在质量下降问题，本文旨在解决解码不可逆和误差累积导致的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了WINO，一种基于并行草拟和验证机制的解码算法，通过生成多个候选词元并使用双向上下文验证和重新掩码可疑的词元，从而实现可撤销解码。

Result: 在开源DLLMs如LLaDA和MMaDA上的实验表明，WINO大幅提升了质量和速度的平衡性能，例如在GSM8K基准测试中推理加速6倍且精度提升2.58%；在Flickr30K标题生成中实现10倍加速并且性能更高。

Conclusion: WINO算法显示了其在提升DLLMs速度和性能上的优越性，为该领域的研究提供了有价值的思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理专门领域任务时往往成本高昂或表现有限，并缺乏任务间的普适性，对领域特定特征的捕获存在不足。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，利用Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, 和 Task type，对专门领域的未标注数据生成高质量指令微调数据。包括逻辑和自检，以提升推理和模型性能，同时支持定制任务指令。

Conclusion: AQuilt能有效解决专门领域大型语言模型的成本与性能问题，同时具备跨任务的更好推广性，为研究提供了开源资源。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法具有局限性，需要更有效的机制将文本反馈与数值奖励相结合，以提升提示生成质量。

Method: 提出了Textual Reward Prompt框架，将文本反馈直接融入提示模型的训练中，通过迭代改进生成的提示，强化模型对于“良好”提示的理解能力，并与LLM结合生成高质量提示。

Result: 该框架在GSMHard和MATH等具有挑战性的数学数据集上生成了领域最优的查询特定提示。

Conclusion: TRPrompt框架证明了将文本反馈融入提示优化的有效性，为提示生成提供了一种训练与推理结合的新方法。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for

### [140] [Checklists Are Better Than Reward Models For Aligning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18624)
*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），用以提升语言模型在遵循指令的能力上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常使用固定标准进行强化学习，但这种方法缺乏灵活性，无法完全满足用户指令的多样性需求。

Method: 从指令中提取清单条目，并利用AI评估器和专业验证程序评估模型响应的满足程度，将这些评分结合形成奖励信号，用于强化学习。

Result: 提出的RLCF方法在五个广泛研究的基准测试上均有显著提升，包括FollowBench硬满足率提升4分，InFoBench提升6分，以及Arena-Hard的胜率提升3分。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是一种能够显著改善语言模型对多样化需求的支持的新工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究采用符号回归（SR）方法对三维不可压缩流体流动进行建模，生成解析型数学表达式，并提出融合回答集程序设计（ASP）的方法，以确保结果的物理可信度和领域一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于流体力学中不仅需要精准预测，还需理解底层物理机制，而符号回归能够挖掘可解释的数学关系，这有助于简化复杂流动行为。

Method: 通过PySR库从数值模拟数据直接推导出符号方程，结合ASP框架优化SR生成的表达式，确保方程既统计准确又符合物理约束原则。

Result: 获得的符号方程准确反映了研究流动中的速度分布和压降特性，结果与已有解析解完全一致。

Conclusion: 符号回归可以将复杂流动行为简化为简单可解释的数学方程，结合知识表示技术可提升可靠性，为实时数据分析和可解释预测框架提供重要参考。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为I2I-STRADA的架构，用于改进数据分析中多代理系统的推理过程，通过模块化子任务实现结构化分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统在实现任务自动化管理方面取得进展，但对于数据分析中需要的认知工作流缺乏关注，造成推理过程缺乏一致性。

Method: 设计了I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务形式化推理过程，反映分析推理的认知步骤，进行合理的任务规划与执行调整。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试上的性能表明I2I-STRADA在计划连贯性和洞见对齐方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在数据分析的代理设计中引入结构化认知工作流的重要性，并验证了I2I-STRADA架构的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS

Motivation: 现有的定性时间线规划方法需要将问题还原为非确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，但这要求高成本的确定化步骤，难以直接合成策略。

Method: 作者识别出定性时间线规划的一个片段，其计划存在性问题可以直接映射为确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，并能直接用来合成策略。此外，文章还提出了符合该确定性片段的最大子集。

Result: 对定性时间线规划的计划存在性问题进行了简化和提升，并解决了确定化过程中的高成本问题。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法优化了计划存在性问题的处理过程，使得规划策略的合成更加高效。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

TL;DR: 论文提出E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过五个阶段将模型生成的错误转化为创造性资产，显著提升生成内容的创造性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何让人工智能摆脱模仿，迈向真正的创造性。

Method: 提出了E.A.R.T.H.框架，包括错误生成、放大、优化选择、转换及反馈利用五个阶段，并通过LLM、语义评分和人类反馈等工具实现。

Result: 在框架优化下创造性分数提高了70.4%，生成标语更简洁、原创性更高且与输入更相关，多模态测试结果和人类评价均表现优异。

Conclusion: 错误驱动与反馈优化的生成方法可提升创造力，为人工智能达到自我进化和人类对齐创造性提供了可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

Motivation: 探讨可视化工具（如散点图）是否不仅对人类有用，也可提升AI系统的数据分析能力。

Method: 设计实验使用两种视觉语言模型，测试在三种分析任务中数据集搭配不同图表的表现，比较无图表和图表与数据不匹配的基线条件。

Result: 结果显示，当散点图与原始数据搭配时，模型描述更精确；相比之下，空白图表和数据不匹配图表的表现较差。

Conclusion: 初步证据表明，AI系统与人类一样，可以从数据可视化中获益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

TL;DR: MAGPO是一种改进多智能体强化学习的框架，通过结合集中式指导与分散执行，提供了一种高效的解决方案，解决了现有CTDE方法存在的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法在集中训练利用上不足，且通常缺乏理论保证，难以应对实际中的部分可观测性和通信限制问题。

Method: MAGPO结合了一种自回归联合策略用于协调探索，同时使策略符合分散执行需求，确保在部分可观测场景下能够部署。

Result: 在43项任务和6个不同环境的实验中，MAGPO表现出明显优势，优于强CTDE基线并匹敌或超越完全集中的方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO框架为分散多智能体学习提供了一个理论支持充分且实践可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ASI-Arch，一个用于神经架构发现的人工超智能系统（ASI4AI），实现了AI自身进行架构创新，突破了传统NAS限制，发现了106种最新线性注意力架构，开辟了计算可扩展的科学研究新路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI发展受到人类认知能力的限制，尤其是在AI架构的研究中，传统方法局限于探索人类定义的框架空间，需要一种全新的方法来实现创新和突破。

Method: 提出ASI-Arch系统，用于端到端的神经架构发现研究，能够独立假设、实现、训练并验证新的神经架构，通过大量的GPU计算进行实验，达到完全自主的创新。

Result: 系统通过20,000 GPU小时运行了1,773次自主实验，发现了106种创新的最新线性注意力架构，展示了超越人类设计的潜力并揭示了新的设计原则。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch证明科学发现过程可以实现计算可扩展，突破了人类限制，其设计原则和自主研究能力为自我加速AI系统的发展提供了新蓝图。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

Motivation: 目前医疗领域的机器学习解决方案构建与部署由于工作流程碎片化、模型兼容性问题及数据隐私限制，仍然昂贵且费力。作者希望通过自动化手段简化这些高摩擦环节。

Method: 通过构建一个模块化、任务特定的代理系统，这些代理系统可以处理多种结构化和非结构化数据，完成特征选择、模型选择及预处理推荐等任务。

Result: 在公开数据集（涉及老年医学、缓和医疗及结肠镜成像数据）测试中，框架高效自动化各阶段任务，减少专家干预需求。在具体案例中，实现了从数据类型检测、隐私合规处理到特征提取和模型运行的全过程自动化。

Conclusion: 通过自动化机器学习生命周期中的各个高摩擦阶段，该框架为临床环境中的AI部署提供了可扩展且成本高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Motivation: 在COVID-19疫苗快速开发后，由于临床试验期间的安全数据收集时间有限，以及疫苗早期广泛接种的实际情况，亟需更高效的疫苗上市后安全监测手段。

Method: 通过结合自然语言处理、数据增强、主动学习和评价技术，优化注释数据的质量和模型性能，开发急诊分诊记录中的分类器。

Result: 论文提出的方法提高了疫苗安全信号监测的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 使用主动学习和NLP技术，可增强从急诊分诊记录中提取疫苗安全信息的能力，为快速部署疫苗安全监测模型提供可行解法。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究采用均值聚合的GNN的能力，以理解其与其他聚合方式如最大值和总和聚合相比的表达区别，并找到其逻辑特性表现。

Method: 通过比较均值聚合GNN在非统一和统一场景下的表达能力，分析它与比值模态逻辑、交替自由模态逻辑等的关系；并研究与MSO逻辑的对应情况。

Result: 非统一情况下，均值GNN与比值模态逻辑表达能力相同，优于最大值聚合GNN但弱于总和聚合GNN。在统一情况下，均值GNN与交替自由模态逻辑表达能力一致，但较总和和最大值聚合GNN弱。

Conclusion: 均值聚合的GNN在逻辑表达上有一定局限性，其能力介于其他两种聚合之间，且在统一/非统一设定下表现不同。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了认知归因框架，以区分和测量大语言模型（LLMs）中知识与推理的贡献，从而帮助理解其推理和知识检索过程的关系及作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在模型分析、可解释性及发展中，区分知识与推理的能力至关重要，该研究旨在通过认知归因框架深入探讨LLMs的内部运作机制。

Method: 研究采用双认知模式（快速思考与慢速思考）框架，将LLMs的认知过程分为知识检索（第一阶段）与推理调整（第二阶段），并通过在3个数据集上对15种LLMs的表现进行分析，总结知识与推理的贡献特点。

Result: （1）推理调整对数学、物理、化学等需要较多推理的领域更有帮助，但可能对知识密集型领域造成影响；（2）参数扩展同时增强知识与推理，特别是知识，且使推理更审慎且更具智能；（3）知识主要集中在较低网络层，推理则发生在较高层次。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs理解提供了一种从“解耦”视角审视的方式，并为扩展定律、层次知识编辑以及小模型推理限制等相关研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Motivation: 研究非极小语义模型如何在答案集编程中处理析取，从而扩展稳定模型的应用范围。

Method: 分析四种不同的析取语义（Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models, Forks, Determining Inference），并进行形式化证明其关系与区别。

Result: 证明了三种语义（Forks、Justified Models 和 DI 的合理松弛版本）在定义上可统一为共同语义，且该语义强于第四种（Strongly Supported Models）。

Conclusion: 统一的解析语义为答案集编程提供了更强大的建模能力，同时保持稳定模型的扩展特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in

TL;DR: 本文提出了用于AI定性风险评估的概念框架，针对法律合规与基本权利保护的复杂性，整合了定义性平衡与可驳推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对《欧盟AI法案》，需要一个解决法律合规性及基本权利保护问题的框架，同时强调AI部署对权利的潜在影响。

Method: 结合定义性平衡法（通过比例分析解决权利冲突）和可驳推理法（适应法律决策的动态特性）。

Result: 提出了处理高风险AI和通用AI系统的层次化方法，为AI风险评估提供哲学基础与伦理考虑。

Conclusion: 框架提供了更具操作性的评估模型，将理论见解与实践应用相结合，促进负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动批改考试是一项挑战，尤其是在对学生答案的正确性与标准答案进行比对时。

Method: 使用大语言模型来分析学生的解答并将其标准化，应用自动推理技术评估答案的正确性，使用SMT求解器及针对物理问题设计的术语重写系统来进行证明。

Result: 系统基于2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克考试的1500多份真实学生答卷进行评估，检验了系统的效果。

Conclusion: 开发了可用于自动批改物理考试的有效系统，并详细探讨了其中的术语重写系统设计与定理证明。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Conclusion: ConDiFi为评估LLMs在金融领域中的推理能力提供了新视角，对LLMs在金融领域的安全和战略性应用具有重要参考价值。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则的理论框架IBRO，用于优化大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，并通过轻量化的IB正则化技术实现了推理性能的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLM的推理性能主要依赖于启发式的强化学习方法，但缺乏理论依据，因此需要一种理论指导的方法来提高推理效率以及模型的通用性。

Method: 提出了一种基于信息瓶颈原则的IBRO框架，并推导出实际可操作的令牌级替代目标，采用轻量化的IB正则化技术，将其无缝集成到现有的RL训练框架中。

Result: 通过在多个数学推理基准和强化学习算法上的验证，IB正则化技术显著提高了LLM的推理能力，并保持较低的计算开销。

Conclusion: IBRO框架提供了一种理论支持的新方法，通过轻量化的IB正则化优化LLM的推理能力，具有良好的通用性和推广性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Motivation: 旨在减少呼叫中心的客户等待时间和员工空闲时间，提高服务效率。

Method: 探讨了基于系统动态已知的值迭代(VI)和通过结合离散事件模拟(DES)与OpenAI Gym框架进行模型自由学习的近端策略优化(PPO)两种方法。问题被建模为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)。

Result: 经过1,000次测试，PPO方法优化效果最佳，达到了最高奖励，并显著降低了客户等待时间和员工空闲时间，尽管需要更长的训练时间。

Conclusion: PPO方法在呼叫中心优化中表现出色，是最优的策略优化方法，尽管成本是更长的训练时间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 随着移动和边缘计算的发展，低比特量化模型在边缘设备上的需求增加。为了应对性能下降和计算成本高的问题，本文提出了一个名为QuaRC的量化感知训练框架，成功提升了小数据集上的性能。

Motivation: 低比特量化模型在边缘设备上的部署需要高效的解决方案，但隐私问题限制了训练数据的使用，传统方法成本过高且性能下降。

Method: 提出了QuaRC框架，包括相对熵评分的核心集选择阶段和级联层矫正的训练阶段，有效减少中间层量化误差。

Result: 实验表明，在1%的数据子集条件下，QuaRC能将ResNet-18量化到2-bit时在ImageNet-1K上Top-1准确率提高5.72%，超越了现有技术。

Conclusion: QuaRC通过创新的核心集选择与层矫正策略，在小规模数据集上有效解决了量化误差问题，为边缘设备上的低比特量化模型部署开辟了新的路径。

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CICME方法，通过从多域异质数据中推断因果机制以深入理解复杂传感系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过因果关系的视角更好理解复杂传感系统，提出一种能有效从多域数据推测因果机制的新方法。

Method: 基于因果迁移学习（CTL）原理，三步骤估计：先检测域不变的共因果机制，再区分各域个体因果机制。

Result: 在制造过程场景中，利用线性高斯模型验证，显示CICME优于基线方法，尤其在某些场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: CICME通过结合全局和域内数据发现因果关系，为解析复杂系统提供新工具，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合扩散模型和大型语言模型(LLM)的新型模型LSDM，用于预测个人用户的服务级移动流量，取得了显著的预测性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人用户服务级移动流量的精确预测对网络效率和服务质量的提升至关重要，但由于复杂动荡的用户模式、环境上下文缺乏和服务依赖关系，现有方法存在准确性和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 作者提出了LLM增强的时空扩散模型(LSDM)，将扩散模型的生成能力与Transformer的学习能力相结合，并结合大型语言模型捕获的多模态环境信息，以建模服务级流量模式和动态变化。

Result: 通过对真实服务级数据集进行广泛评估，LSDM在流量使用预测中的表现优于现有模型，其中LLM增强后至少提高了2.83%的决定系数；与类似类型的模型（如CSDI）相比均方根误差至少降低8.29%。

Conclusion: LSDM模型在复杂的个人流量预测任务上表现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性，有助于网络优化和服务创新。

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

Result: 在水分配和下水道系统的真实数据实验中，验证了预测和异常检测的有效性。

Conclusion: CoCAI在提供统计有效预测和鲁棒异常检测方面表现优秀，并且基于理论设计具备实际可行性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Result: 在数学推理任务中，如QwQ和DeepSeek-R1-0528等模型展示了GenSelect方法的优越性，通过简单提示超过了现有评分方法。

Conclusion: GenSelect方法证明了结合LLM比较能力与并行采样的效率，同时为推理任务带来了更优的性能。

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在处理局地强降水预测时，使用基于过程的数值天气预报模型具有挑战性，需要改进高分辨率降水预测方法。

Method: 使用Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）进行降水下采样，与传统均方误差训练的神经网络相比，WGAN优化传输成本，生成更真实的降水结构。

Result: WGAN生成了具有细致结构的降水场，其视觉真实性更高，且WGAN评论者得分与人类感知真实性高度相关。

Conclusion: WGAN框架不仅提高了降水下采样中的感知真实性，还为降水数据集的评估和质量控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Method: 提出GraphEXT框架，将图划分为独立子图，结合外部性下的Shapley值计算，通过节点的边际贡献量化其重要性，突出结构改变对GNN预测的影响。

Result: 实验证明，GraphEXT在多种GNN架构上表现优于现有基线方法，在真实和合成数据集上提高了模型解释的保真度。

Conclusion: GraphEXT显著提升了GNN的解释性，尤其是对节点之间交互及结构变化影响的解释能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

Motivation: 当前在分子生成设计中，由于具有理想属性的分子稀缺，难以直接通过训练模型生成目标分子。

Method: 提出了“分子任务算术”的方法，通过使用负向样本训练模型，学习属性方向，并在分子设计中朝相反的属性方向移动以生成正向分子。

Result: 实验验证表明该方法在20个零样本设计任务中生成的分子更加多样化，且在双目标与少样本设计任务中也具有较高的性能并保持分子多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法以其简单性、数据效率与性能优势，有望成为新型分子设计的标准迁移学习策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Motivation: 解决传统傅里叶神经算子（FNO）无法处理非周期性输入的问题，同时提供对路径依赖的随机微分方程和分数布朗运动的近似能力。

Method: 通过引入镜像填充技术扩展标准FNO，并结合Wong--Zakai定理和多种近似技术进行理论分析，设计出MFNO模型。

Result: MFNO具有卓越的分辨率泛化能力，并在性能上与LSTM、TCN和DeepONet等基线模型可比或更优，同时在样本路径生成速度上显著快于传统数值方法。

Conclusion: MFNO模型在处理随机系统动态的任务中展现了突出的理论基础和实际性能，尤其是在非周期性输入和分辨率泛化方面表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了在存在显著分布偏移的情况下，公共和私人数据结合对差分隐私机器学习的价值，发现公共数据的益处受分布偏移大小的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私方法的有效性往往依赖于额外的公共数据，但当两种数据源的分布相同时，无互补价值引发了对分布偏移情况下的补充价值的探索。

Method: 通过研究高斯均值估计和高斯线性回归两种情境，分析分布偏移下公共与私人数据的交互及其对私密参数估计的影响。

Result: 当偏移较小时，需要足够丰度的公共或私人数据以保证准确估计，但当偏移较大时，公共数据对结果没有任何帮助。

Conclusion: 论文表明，公共数据在小偏移情况下可能有所补充价值，但偏移过大会导致它失去作用，为差分隐私算法的应用提供了新边界。

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Conclusion: SETOL为神经网络的层质量提供了新的解释和计算方法，新提出的ERG指标显示出了预测能力，与HTSR一致。

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

Conclusion: 人机协作方法能够充分利用人类的创造力和机器的计算能力，构建更全面、可扩展的提示数据集，有助于持续性评估T2I模型的安全性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

### [183] [Multimodal Fine-grained Reasoning for Post Quality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17934)
*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MFTRR的框架，通过多模态推理与排序任务方法提升帖子质量评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未能充分利用多模态线索、存在数据噪声干扰、缺乏复杂语义关系的捕捉能力。

Method: 设计了两个模块：局部-全局语义关联推理模块，通过抑制噪声提升语义交互；多级证据关系推理模块，通过宏观和微观线索加强推理。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的实验表现显著超越现有方法，在Art History数据集上NDCG@3指标提升9.52%。

Conclusion: MFTRR有效解决了技术问题，展示了在多模态质量评估任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Motivation: 提升对地理空间表格数据的建模精准性和解释能力，以及提升模型的计算效率。

Method: 通过优化数据加载和模型前向计算流程来提升效率，同时引入模型集成策略及GeoShapley框架，以增强模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 改进的GA模型不仅在性能上超过了先前版本，还能提供更具解释性分析，研究成果和完整流程已向社区公开。

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了SIFOTL方法，通过隐私安全的统计摘要数据处理表格数据的偏移分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据分析中的数据偏移问题，特别是在隐私限制和复杂噪声的情况下，帮助决策系统分析，尤其是医疗领域。

Method: (i) 从数据中提取隐私兼容的统计摘要;(ii) 使用双XGBoost模型和LLM协助去除噪声中的干扰信号;(iii) 用帕累托加权决策树合并XGBoost输出，定位偏移的具体片段来源。

Result: 在多个数据集测试中表现优异，例如在MEPS数据集上F1得分为0.85，显著超过基准模型。此外，在Synthea ABM生成的18个多样化的EHR数据集中，该方法在无噪声情况下F1得分达0.86-0.96，在引入噪声情况下F1得分仍达到>=0.75。

Conclusion: SIFOTL是一种可解释、隐私友好且对观测噪声具有强鲁棒性的分析框架。

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

Motivation: 因交通数据中的隐私、安全性及数据新鲜度问题日益显现，以及法规引入的“被遗忘权”要求，需要开发使模型可选择性遗忘敏感数据的方案，以化解公众对智能交通系统的信任危机。

Method: 引入了一种新型学习范式“机器遗忘”，旨在让受过训练的交通状态估计与预测模型能够选择性地忘记隐私敏感、被污染或过时的数据。

Result: 通过一个新的模型学习框架，使模型在保留功能的同时具备选择性移除指定数据的能力，解决了隐私敏感数据的删除问题。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘技术增强了交通状态估计和预测的可信性与可靠性，为解决数据隐私问题提供了一个关键方向。

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Method: 提出了一种预测性框架，分析训练动态并优化计算资源使用，同时通过实验得出了基于模型大小、初始性能及训练进展的经验扩展定律。

Result: 发现训练阶段可分为三个阶段，并确定在一定的epoch之后收益甚微，仅需早停即可显著减少计算成本而不降低性能。

Conclusion: 本文的框架普适性强，为基于GRPO的高效微调提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Motivation: 目前海洋学中的卫星数据（如Copernicus）在空间分辨率上不够精细，无法满足局部分析的需求，需要一种能够提升分辨率的建模方法。

Method: 基于神经算子引入了一种监督深度学习框架，可解决PDE问题并生成任意分辨率的解决方案，并提出了适用于Copernicus海洋流数据的下采样模型。

Result: 模型在实际Copernicus海洋流数据和合成Navier-Stokes模拟数据上进行了验证，效果优秀。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提供高分辨率的海洋流数据预测，提升海洋数据的空间粒度，为实际海洋应用提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Conclusion: GSPO算法有助于简化强化学习基础设施设计，同时已证明可改善语言模型性能，如最新的Qwen3模型。

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,
efficient, and performant reinforcement learning algorithm for training large

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

TL;DR: C-AAE是一种结合AAE与ADPCM的算法，用于提升传感器活动数据的隐私保护，同时降低数据存储需求，并保持活动识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器数据虽然能精准分析行为，但也存在用户隐私泄露的风险，因此需要有效的隐私保护方法。

Method: 提出了C-AAE算法，将Anonymizing AutoEncoder(AAE)与自适应差分脉冲编码调制(ADPCM)结合，通过消除用户身份特征并降低位率来实现数据保护与压缩。

Result: C-AAE在MotionSense和PAMAP2数据集上表现优异：相比AAE单独使用，用户重新识别准确率降低了10-15%，同时活动识别准确性仅下降不到5%，数据量减少了约75%。

Conclusion: C-AAE成功在传感器活动识别中实现了隐私保护与实用性之间的平衡，为医疗健康领域的传感器数据处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM是一种混合精度的后量化训练技术，用于将大语言模型的存储需求压缩至平均1.6位每权重，并显著提升其推断精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型因参数数量庞大和计算成本高昂，部署面临挑战。而极低位量化可以大幅降低存储需求并加速推断，但现有方法在平均位宽小于等于2时导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了Squeeze10-LLM框架，通过后量化训练实现极低位混合精度量化。使用PBAR (后二值化激活鲁棒性) 和FIAS (全信息激活监督) 两项关键创新，分别提升权重显著性评估和减少量化时的累积误差。

Result: 在LLaMA和LLaMA2模型上的实验表明，Squeeze10-LLM在权重仅为1.6位下，六个零样本分类任务的平均准确率由43%提升至56%。

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM在次2位权重量化中达到了最先进的性能，为部署大语言模型提供了一种更加高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

Result: 通过生成误差分析和实验验证，表明设计附加监督可提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: 附加监督中的分布信息和混合系数在优化软标签和提高分类模型性能上起关键作用，即使简单利用也有帮助。

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在性能和资源分配效率上表现优越，为RAN切片和MVNOs的资源优化提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Conclusion: 本研究为无需更改环境的对抗攻击提出了新思路，通过有效的奖励优化显著降低了目标代理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在测试时间内进行自我改进的能力，重点是在数学推理任务中利用模型自己的信心选择方法。

Method: 提出一种基于前缀置信度（prefix-confidence）的缩放方法，用于选择数学推理任务中最有前景的尝试，并评估其在多个数据集上的表现。

Result: 在五个数学推理数据集上，前缀置信度缩放方法相较于多数投票方法表现出更好的准确性-计算权衡，并且对长度偏差的敏感度较低。

Conclusion: 前缀置信度缩放能显著改进数学推理任务的性能，且相比其他方法更有效稳定，但测试时间训练未能超越前缀置信度缩放。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

TL;DR: 提出ChronoSelect框架，通过时间动态分析改善带有噪声标签的数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统在噪声标签数据上训练深度神经网络时，模型倾向于记忆噪声标签导致泛化性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出ChronoSelect，通过四阶段记忆架构和滑动更新机制，压缩预测历史为紧凑的时间分布，并对样本进行三分类，提高模型在噪声数据下的表现。

Result: 实验表明ChronoSelect在合成和真实基准测试中表现最优，并通过理论证明了其在噪声情况下的收敛性和稳定性。

Conclusion: ChronoSelect通过引入时间动态分析和独特记忆机制，成功实现对噪声数据的鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 通过跨数据集评估(在Argoverse2上训练，在NuScenes上评估)，证明新方法在未见场景中提高了目标选择过程的效果。

Conclusion: 使用异构图和多阶段方法的GNN能有效提高跨数据集的泛化性能，有望促进自动驾驶技术的发展。

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦图学习方法通常依赖同步通信，导致效率低下；而异步联邦学习方法又无针对图数据的特性优化，可能导致全局模型语义漂移和表达不一致。

Method: 引入FedSA-GCL框架，采用ClusterCast机制，利用客户间标签分布差异和图的拓扑特性进行高效训练。

Result: 在多个真实图数据集和两种分割算法下，FedSA-GCL方法表现出较强的鲁棒性和效率，平均性能分别优于基线方法2.92%和3.4%。

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL通过结合图特性和异步联邦学习，实现了在图数据场景中的高效分布式训练，提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

<details>

Motivation: 傳統SINDy方法存在設計候選基函數集合（圖書館）的挑戰，因為對許多動態系統而言，適當的圖書館設計並不明確，因此需要一種機制簡化用戶負擔且提高模型可靠性。

Method: 文章提出SINDy-LOM方法，將基函數參數化並採用雙層優化架構：內層優化提取數據驅動模型；外層優化從遞歸長期預測準確性的角度調整基函數，即圖書館設計被轉化為優化基函數參數的過程。

Result: SINDy-LOM方法產生了具有良好可解釋性和實用性的簡約模型，並顯著降低了用戶負擔；與傳統SINDy方法相比，該方法提高了模型的可靠性和長期預測能力。

Conclusion: 文中提出的SINDy-LOM方法通過圖書館優化改進了數據驅動動態系統建模方式，並在柴油發動機氣路系統中驗證了其有效性。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Result: 研究表明，完全修正方法在浅决策树的场景下可以超越或媲美当前主流方法（如XGBoost和LightGBM），并能显著减少模型的稀疏性。此外，这些方法能有效简化预训练集成模型而无需牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 完全修正Boosting方法具有潜力，但其局限性也需要在具体应用中权衡。

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM通过统计增强技术为训练数据丰富性提供了新途径，是提升预测流程监控性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Conclusion: 回归感知的惩罚机制能够显著减少基于持续学习的恶意软件检测中的安全性回退问题，同时不牺牲模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

Motivation: 随着电池驱动的交通工具和储能系统的快速普及，更加高效和安全的电池健康监测变得至关重要。为了保证操作的可靠性与安全性，准确估计电池健康状态（SoH）是必要的。但传统的机器学习架构常受到数据不规则性限制，难以呈现高精度预测。

Conclusion: TIDSIT不仅提升了电池健康状态预测的准确性，还拥有广泛健康监控不规则时间序列数据应用的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

Motivation: 分析当前的多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法为何在使用低级模型时依然取得成功，这是否得益于有效的马尔可夫信号恢复。

Method: 通过案例研究对现有MARL模型和算法进行分析，评估其在设计要求下的适用性，并提出改进建议。

Result: 发现现有的MARL方法依赖于脆弱的协同约定，而非有效的观察与记忆能力，而在任务设计需要时，可促使模型学习有基础的政策。

Conclusion: 建议设计更好测试Dec-POMDP核心假设的合作环境，以促进基于观察和记忆的真正技能学习。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Motivation: 解决HyperDeepONets记忆和计算成本高的问题，同时提高预测精度和泛化能力。

Method: 使用低秩适配(LoRA)分解超网络输出层权重矩阵，通过引入两个较小的低秩矩阵减少参数，从而实现正则化效果。

Result: 在常微分方程和偏微分方程的实验中，参数减少70%，在预测精度和泛化性方面优于常规HyperDeepONets。

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets能显著减小模型复杂度，提升计算效率和效果，是HyperDeepONets的有效改进方案。

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

Conclusion: 首次证明通过证据蒸馏方法，可以在LLMs中实现即时且稳健的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

Motivation: 当前洪水预测和水资源管理受到河流流量观测数据不足的制约，现有方法在数据稀缺条件下难以实现高精度、可解释性和计算效率的平衡，因此需要一种新方法来解决此问题。

Method: 提出的新方法HYPER结合了基于Bayesian模型平均（BMA）的多模型集成和Reservoir Computing（RC）。首先对43种未校准的集水区概念水文模型应用BMA，然后通过线性回归训练RC模型来校正BMA的误差。对于无监测的数据集水区，通过基于有监测区域的集水区属性推断所需权重，构建可推广性框架。

Result: 在对日本87个流域数据的评估中，HYPER在数据丰富场景下的性能（KGE中位数0.56）与LSTM相当，但仅需后者5%的计算时间。在数据稀缺场景下，HYPER仍保持鲁棒性能（KGE 0.55），而LSTM的性能显著下降（KGE -0.04）。

Conclusion: HYPER表明，集水区概念水文模型在大型集成环境和基于机器学习的偏差校正下无需单独校准即可取得良好效果。该方法具有鲁棒性、高效性和广泛适用性，尤其适用于无监测数据区域的流量预测。

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种修订版的仿真度量算法，解决了传统方法存在的两个主要问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿真度量在强化学习中表现出色，但存在表征能力不足和依赖预设权重的问题。

Method: 引入状态-动作对的测量，定义更精确的奖励差距，并提出具有自适应系数的更新算子。

Result: 理论上证明了新方法的收敛性和改进后的表征差异度，并通过DeepMind Control和Meta-World基准测试验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 修订版仿真度量有效解决了传统模型的不足，为强化学习任务提供了更好的表现与理论支持。

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

*Zhongtian Sun,Anoushka Harit,Alexandra Cristea,Christl A. Donnelly,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GLANCE的新型框架，用于解决图神经网络在异构图上的学习局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN在处理特征或标签不同的异构图时存在表现不佳的问题，主要因为无法有效聚合邻居信息、并未充分利用高阶结构模式。

Method: GLANCE框架融合了逻辑引导推理、动态图精炼及自适应聚类，包含逻辑层、多头注意力边剪枝和聚类机制，用于提高图表示学习能力。

Result: 在Cornell、Texas、Wisconsin等基准数据集的实验结果表明，GLANCE表现优异，能够在异构图情境中提供稳健且可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: GLANCE是一个轻量级、适配性强的框架，特别适合解决异构图中的学习挑战。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在没有真实训练数据的情况下，通过少量真实样本获得有用的类条件生成器，从而指导知识蒸馏。

Method: 训练一个受冻结教师模型和PCA几何约束引导的类条件生成器，通过语义和结构损失激活教师输出，并将生成样本约束在从少量样本估计的类特定PCA子空间内。

Result: 实验证明，在MNIST数据集上，即使是最小的类结构也足够支持有效的合成训练流程。

Conclusion: 该框架在保证拓扑一致性和多样性的同时，无需访问真实数据便能实现知识蒸馏，展示了极少样本下的生成能力及其实用性。

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [216] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个通用的力-度量-偏差（FMB）理论框架，将多种学习算法、优化方法和自然选择统一于一种数学结构中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同学习算法、优化方法及自然选择之间的数学共性，旨在揭示背后的通用规律，并提供一个统一的理论框架。

Method: 使用Price方程的符号分割，导出了一个普适的力-度量-偏差（FMB）法则，结合参数改进过程中的协方差、逆曲率缩放、动量偏差和探索噪声，将学习算法抽象为同一底层过程。

Result: 通过该框架，统一了自然选择、贝叶斯更新、牛顿法、随机梯度下降等多种算法，并解释了Fisher信息、KL散度等在学习动态中的自然出现。

Conclusion: FMB法则揭示了学习算法背后的通用结构，能够帮助设计和比较多学科的学习算法，提供了一个系统化的分析基础。

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文确认GPTQ量化方法与Babai的最近平面算法在几何意义上的等价性，从而为GPTQ提供理论基础，并提出其若无截断条件下错误上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部署大规模语言模型时，因硬件限制需要将模型权重量化至低位宽，GPTQ成为常用的一种后训练量化方法，但其运作逻辑缺乏清晰的理论支持。

Method: 从数学上证明了GPTQ在从后向前执行的情况下等价于求解经典格点问题CVP的Babai算法，并分析其几何意义及误差上界。

Result: 揭示GPTQ的几何解释，使其误差传播步骤得到直观理解，并且在无截断条件下，其误差范围可被Babai算法的理论界限约束。

Conclusion: 通过将GPTQ与格点算法联系起来，为量化方法提供了坚实的理论支持，并为未来模型量化算法的设计奠定基础。

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Conclusion: 提供了一种可行方法，在实际数据获取受限时，通过独立、与模型无关的合成数据方法实现公平性评估。

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前处理空间数据需考虑对象的相对位置，但现有方法需显式计算对象间的相对位置，导致内存需求为二次方。

Method: 提出一种SE(2)不变点积注意力机制，并应用到基于Transformer的架构中，将内存需求优化至线性。

Result: 实验表明，与非不变架构相比，该方法在实际应用中更具可实施性且性能更优。

Conclusion: 引入线性内存需求的SE(2)不变注意力机制，为空间数据任务提供了有效解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的端到端蛋白设计方法，解决了条件扩散模型中蛋白生成的可靠性问题，提出的评估方式为生成质量提供了新的衡量标准。

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Conclusion: 本文证明了BASS方法可以有效提升物理约束环境下人机协作的表现，展示了其对多样行为和物理属性的适应能力。

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI

Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the

Conclusion: 神经形态计算在某些类别算法例如迭代优化、蒙特卡洛采样中表现优越。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

Motivation: 旨在提高固定点乘法器的能效，尤其是在AI负载中常见的零值附近输入场景下。

Result: 在实际输入值中，4位乘法器设计的切换活动降低了12.9%，输入范围减少时切换活动可降低至33%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持逻辑等价性的前提下显著提升了功率效率，并支持进一步基于切换活动的设计空间优化，提出了一种可靠且效率高的设计方法。

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.
