### [2] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对单目度量深度估计模型在水下环境中的性能进行了全面评估，发现现有模型在水下表现较差，通过在合成水下数据集上微调模型，显著提高了其估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于光衰减、散射和颜色失真等问题，当前单目深度估计在水下环境中的可靠性较低，同时缺乏高质量的度量真值数据集。

Method: 作者对包括FLSea和SQUID在内的实际水下数据集上的零样本和微调模型进行基准测试，并采用基于物理的水下图像生成模型生成合成水下数据集，对Depth Anything V2模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在所有基准上性能均有提升，且优于仅在清洁陆地数据上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在水下场景中进行单目深度估计必须重视领域适配和基于尺度的监督，这对于未来研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

### [3] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于链式推理的事件流场景文本识别框架ESTR-CoT，解决了现有方法在解释性和上下文逻辑推理方面的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前事件流场景文本识别中模型解释性不足和上下文逻辑推理能力弱的问题。

Method: 采用EVA-CLIP视觉编码器生成视觉标记，用Llama tokenizer编码生成提示，通过Q-former对齐视觉标记和预训练的Vicuna-7B语言模型，同时输出答案和链式推理过程；提出一个大规模链式推理数据集用于框架训练。

Result: 在事件流场景文本识别的三大基准数据集上表现出了高效性和良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 新框架ESTR-CoT在性能和解释性上实现了突破，证明其潜力，并为基于推理的大模型发展提供基础数据。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

### [4] [Team RAS in 9th ABAW Competition: Multimodal Compound Expression Recognition Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02205)
*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种零样本多模态方法用于复合情绪识别，通过将六种异构模态结合在单一管道中并引入动态权重和多种概率及特征聚合方法，达到与监督方法相近的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复合情绪识别领域中过去依赖特定任务训练数据的问题，开发无需领域适应的通用方法。

Method: 结合六种模态（如静态与动态面部表情、场景与标签匹配等），采用CLIP和Qwen-VL进行情景理解，引入MHPF模块和CE转换模块使用概率与特征聚合集成信息，生成可解释的复合情绪输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行零样本测试，分别在AffWild2、AFEW和C-EXPR-DB获得了46.95%、49.02%、34.85%的F1分数，达到了与训练特定目标数据的监督方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在无领域适应的情况下有效捕捉复合情绪，验证了方法的有效性并公开了源码。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

### [5] [SciGA: A Comprehensive Dataset for Designing Graphical Abstracts in Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02212)
*Takuro Kawada,Shunsuke Kitada,Sota Nemoto,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SciGA-145k数据集，用于支持图形摘要选择和推荐，并定义了两项任务：论文内及跨论文的图形摘要推荐，且提出了新指标CAR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图形摘要在科学交流中潜力未被充分利用，同时其制作对设计能力要求高，限制了普及。

Method: 引入包含145,000篇论文和114万幅图的SciGA-145k数据集；定义了两项任务：论文内图形摘要推荐和跨论文图形摘要推荐；提出CAR指标以评估推荐模型。

Result: 提出了基线模型，验证了两类推荐任务的合理性并展示了CAR指标的优势。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k在推动科学交流的图形摘要生成与推荐以及科学AI发展上具有重要意义。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [6] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在低数据情况下，通过扩散模型生成合成数据以提升目标检测性能的效果，并比较了基于提示和布局的两种条件化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业视觉系统中因高质量训练数据收集困难导致的目标检测问题，提高训练效率和性能。

Method: 研究了80种视觉概念，通过实验比较了两种扩散模型的条件化策略（提示条件化和布局条件化）的合成数据质量表现。

Result: 在低多样性条件下，提示条件化表现更优；当多样性增加时，布局条件化更胜一筹，在匹配训练分布的条件下，合成数据能将平均精度提升34%到177%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型可高效生成高质量合成数据，不同的条件化策略在不同场景下有显著影响，为低数据环境下的目标检测提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

### [7] [High-Fidelity Differential-information Driven Binary Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02222)
*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DIDB-ViT，一种高效且保留了原始ViT架构的二值化方法，显著提高了图像分类和分割表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二值化ViT方法中性能下降或对全精度模块依赖的问题。

Method: 设计了基于差分信息的注意力模块（informative attention module），采用离散Haar小波进行频率分解，并改进了激活函数（RPReLU）。

Result: DIDB-ViT在多种ViT架构中显著优于现有量化方法，在图像分类和分割任务中表现卓越。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了二值化带来的信息损失，并提高了计算效率，为边缘设备部署提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

### [8] [FMOcc: TPV-Driven Flow Matching for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Selective State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02250)
*Jiangxia Chen,Tongyuan Huang,Ke Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMOcc网络通过TPV改进网络和选择性状态空间模型，结合流量匹配模块提升了3D占据预测，特别是在长距离和被遮挡场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在长距离和遮挡场景下表现不足，并且依赖于多帧图像数据，造成资源消耗过大，因此需要一种有效的少帧图像预测方法。

Method: 提出了一种三视角(TPV)改进的占据网络FMOcc，整合了流量匹配选择状态空间模型(FMSSM)、TPV SSM层以及平面选择性SSM (PS3M)，并设计了掩码训练方法(MT)。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和OpenOcc数据集上，FMOcc表现优异：两帧输入下取得43.1% RayIoU和39.8% mIoU，推理耗时330ms，内存占用仅5.4G。

Conclusion: FMOcc有效克服了少帧输入和资源消耗问题，实现了高效和精准的3D语义占据预测。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

### [9] [SurgVisAgent: Multimodal Agentic Model for Versatile Surgical Visual Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02252)
*Zeyu Lei,Hongyuan Yu,Jinlin Wu,Zhen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SurgVisAgent的智能外科视觉代理，可以动态识别内窥镜图像中的失真类别和程度，执行多种增强任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的高级增强算法大多针对单一任务设计，难以处理复杂的实际手术场景。

Method: 设计了基于多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的SurgVisAgent，结合领域知识、少样本学习和推理，为内窥图像提供多样化的增强。

Result: 在模拟真实手术失真的基准测试中，SurgVisAgent表现优于传统单任务模型。

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent是一种统一的外科手术辅助解决方案，能更好地满足复杂场景下的多方面需求。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

### [10] [Multi-Label Classification Framework for Hurricane Damage Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02265)
*Zhangding Liu,Neda Mohammadi,John E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多标签分类的新框架，用于通过航拍图像评估飓风后损害的类型和范围，其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单标签分类方法无法充分捕捉飓风后损害的复杂性，需要一种更有效的评估工具来支持灾害响应。

Method: 采用ResNet进行特征提取，结合类别特定的注意力机制，开发了一种多标签分类框架来识别单张图像中的多种损害类型。

Result: 在使用Hurricane Michael的Rescuenet数据集时，该方法的平均精准度达到90.23%，超越了现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 该框架改进了飓风后损害评估手段，为更高效的灾害响应和未来减灾策略贡献力量。

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

### [11] [Cross-domain Hyperspectral Image Classification based on Bi-directional Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02268)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Wen Jia,Mengmeng Zhang,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BiDA的框架，用于跨域高光谱图像分类，通过双向域适应提取领域不变特征和领域特定信息，显著提升分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在跨区域或时间的高光谱图像分类中，由于相同类别在不同场景中光谱差异显著，现有方法难以准确分类，亟需新的框架解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了一种基于三分支Transformer架构的BiDA框架，包括源域分支、目标域分支和耦合分支，结合语义分词器与多头交叉注意力机制，并设计了双向蒸馏损失和自适应强化策略，用以提取领域不变与领域特定特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，在跨时间和场景的高光谱图分类任务中，BiDA相较于其他方法在精度上有显著提升，尤其是树种分类任务中其精度超出先进方法3%-5%。

Conclusion: BiDA框架在不同场景的高光谱图像分类中展现出了卓越性能，为领域间的分类问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

Motivation: 提升水下图像质量因探索需求而变得重要，但传统方法和深度学习都有局限性：前者处理能力不足，后者高质量数据集匮乏。

Method: 提出了包含条件三维查找表色彩校正（CLTCC）和多轴自适应增强（MAAE）的MAC-Lookup模型，分别负责初步校正与细节精炼，同时避免过度增强与饱和问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，MAC-Lookup在恢复细节和色彩方面大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup是一种提升水下图像质量的有效方法，创新性地解决了水下图像增强的多个难题。

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

### [13] [Spotlighting Partially Visible Cinematic Language for Video-to-Audio Generation via Self-distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02271)
*Feizhen Huang,Yu Wu,Yutian Lin,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的自蒸馏方法来改进视频转音频（V2A）生成模型，特别是针对部分可见场景的效果显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了电影语言这一关键的艺术表达成分，导致目标音效部分可见的场景下性能表现下降。

Method: 通过模拟电影语言的变化，使用自蒸馏方法使学生模型学习对齐具有相同音视频对应关系的训练对的视频特征，从而捕捉声音与部分视觉信息之间的关联。

Result: 该方法在部分可见性场景下的所有评估指标上均表现出显著提升，同时在大规模V2A数据集VGGSound上也提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入模拟电影语言变化的自蒸馏方法，有效增强了V2A模型在部分可见性和大规模数据集上的表现，适用于电影与视频后期制作。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

*Juntao Liu,Liqiang Niu,Wenchao Chen,Jie Zhou,Fandong Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LaCo框架，通过中间层进行视觉令牌的高效压缩，提升了多模态大语言模型的效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型的视觉令牌压缩方法效率有限，需要有效提高训练和推理过程的效率。

Method: 设计LaCo框架，包含：1)逐层像素重排机制，将相邻令牌通过空间到通道的转换进行合并；2)带非参数捷径的残差学习体系，在压缩过程中保存关键视觉信息。

Result: 与现有方法相比，LaCo在视觉编码器中间层的令牌压缩表现最佳，提高训练效率逾20%、推理吞吐量超过15%，同时保持较强性能。

Conclusion: LaCo框架通过中间层的高效令牌压缩，实现了多模态大语言模型压缩效能与性能的双重提升。

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViRefSAM框架，通过利用少量标注的参考图像指导SAM模型，实现对遥感图像中类一致目标的自动分割，同时解决了构造精确提示和领域适应性不足的两个主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决SAM模型在遥感图像中应用的两个主要挑战：手动构造精确提示费时费力，以及SAM因缺乏领域适应性而难以捕捉遥感特定语义和空间特征。

Method: 提出ViRefSAM框架，引入2个关键组件：一个视觉上下文提示编码器和一个动态目标对齐适配器，前者从参考图像中提取类特定的语义信息并生成提示，后者通过动态调整目标图像特征以减小领域差距。

Result: 在三个少样本分割基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，ViRefSAM无需手动提示即可实现对未知类别的精确自动分割，并在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViRefSAM框架证明了在少样本条件下，结合参考图像和动态适配的方法能够显著提升SAM在遥感图像任务中的表现，为相关领域的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Result: DreamComposer++无缝集成现有视角感知扩散模型，提升了其在多视角条件下生成可控新视角图像的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了可控3D对象重建技术的发展，具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Motivation: 现有的变更检测方法大多侧重于显著变化，而忽略了慢速变化，但慢速变化在实际场景中可能是重大灾害的前兆，因此需要设计一种能够同时检测慢速和快速变化的网络。

Method: 提出了一种双分支的变更检测网络——Flow-CDNet，其中光流分支用于多尺度运动变化提取，二值化分支结合ResNet与光流分支输出用于快速变化检测。此外，设计了Flow-Change数据集、混合损失函数（二值Tversky loss和L2 norm loss），以及评估指标FEPE。

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够应对实际场景中慢速与快速变化的检测需求，为变更检测领域带来新的突破。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Conclusion: LMPNet通过操作滤波器直接检测概念，具备较高的可解释性，展示了弱监督关键点发现的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Method: 提出了一个实验框架，将fMRI信号通过交叉注意机制注入多尺度图像特征，并对物体检测和实例分割任务中的影响进行比较分析。

Result: 实验表明，融合fMRI信号可以显著提升物体检测和分割的精度，说明fMRI信号包含丰富的语义线索和空间定位信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前解码模型未充分利用fMRI的多语义线索，表明未来需要更好的方法整合此类信息以提高解码性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAGIC方法，解决生成工业质量控制中异常数据的三大难题，通过精调Stable Diffusion并引入多层次扰动策略和上下文感知对齐模块，在MVTec-AD数据集上取得了先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用扩散模型生成异常数据时，存在破坏背景、无法精确匹配边界和语义不合理的问题。本文旨在解决这些问题，为工业质控提供更优的少样本异常生成方法。

Method: MAGIC的方法核心是基于Stable Diffusion的精细调整，同时结合两种扰动策略（高斯提示扰动和基于掩码的空间噪声注入）来提高多样性。此外，还包括一个上下文感知的掩码对齐模块以处理语义位置不合理问题。

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上的统一评估协议下，MAGIC的方法在异常检测任务中的性能超过了此前的优秀方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC成功解决了工业异常数据生成中的三个重要痛点，并在实际评价中表现优越，展示了其在提升异常检测质量方面的潜力。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评估指标主要关注视觉质量和时间一致性，无法充分反映合成视频在TVR等下游任务中的表现，需要一个新工具评估其效用。

Method: 设计了一个基准SynTVA，包含800个从MSRVTT训练集派生的用户查询，生成视频并对每对视频-文本进行语义一致性标注，并开发了自动化的评估框架检测与下游TVR性能的相关性。

Result: 通过 SynTVA 数据集的测试表明，高质量的合成视频能够显著提升文本到视频检索的效果，并验证了自动评估框架的效果和潜力。

Conclusion: SynTVA 为评估合成视频的效用提供了一个新工具，可用于数据集增强，从而选择高效的样本优化TVR效果。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本生成图像扩散模型难以实现精确的空间控制。在此背景下，ControlNet让辅助条件模块成为可能，而ControlNet++通过循环一致性损失进一步优化对齐，但中间生成阶段未被充分考虑。

Method: 提出InnerControl训练策略，利用轻量卷积模块从扩散过程中的中间特征中高效提取信号，创建伪真值控制条件，通过对整个扩散过程的差距最小化实现一致性训练。

Result: InnerControl在提升控制精准性和生成质量方面表现卓越，并结合ControlNet++在多种条件方法下实现了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: InnerControl提供了一个对扩散过程全程实施空间控制的新范式，将对图像生成领域产生重要影响。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Motivation: 现有的图像生成模型难以捕捉全局关系且局限于局部信息，本文旨在通过改进编码器架构解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了一种Hita编码器，采用全局到局部的分层编码策略和因果注意力机制，并通过轻量的融合模块优化全局和局部信息的协调。

Result: 在ImageNet基准上，Hita获得了2.59 FID和281.9 IS的优异成绩，并在零样式迁移和图像修复等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Hita能够提高AR生成器的训练效率和表现能力，尤其在全局图像特性捕获方面展现了显著优势。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种专注于水下观测的视频语言模型（VidLM）基准UVLM，针对现存模型在水下场景中的不足进行了改进，并开发出具有挑战性的评估指标和多样的任务设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作的重点主要集中在地面场景，忽视了水下观测的特定需求，从而限制了人工智能在水下领域的应用。

Method: 通过结合人类专业知识和AI模型构建了一套包含多种水下场景挑战的视频数据集，并设计了涵盖多样目标分类和任务类型的多任务评价体系，同时开发了新的评估指标用于比较不同方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，在UVLM上微调的VidLM不仅对水下环境的理解显著提升，同时对现有的非水下基准也可能有一定帮助。

Conclusion: UVLM是第一个专注于水下观测任务的视频语言模型基准测试，该研究填补了水下领域的空白，为相关领域的进一步研究和应用提供了重要的支持。

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的伪标注框架，仅依赖视频数据，通过时间相邻帧对象点跟踪聚合伪LiDAR点云，解决了单目3D目标检测中因数据稀缺和2D到3D的模糊性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统单目3D目标检测面临数据稀缺和2D到3D模糊性的问题，高标注成本限制了数据获取。现有方法多受限于领域特定学习或单一观察的信息。

Method: 提出了一个伪标注框架，以视频数据为基础，通过时间相邻帧的伪LiDAR点云聚合，并利用对象点跟踪技术，提取3D属性，无需多视图设置或额外传感器。

Conclusion: 该方法为单目3D目标检测领域提供了一种经济有效、实用性强的解决方案，无需依赖额外硬件或领域特定数据，突破传统检测方法的局限性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为CoMEL的框架，可在多个任务中实现多重实例学习（MIL）与效率提升，同时最小化遗忘现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多重实例学习技术在应对大规模图像（如病理切片图像）的标注成本方面表现优异，但在需要持续任务和最小遗忘时，其适应能力未被深入探索。尤其是，现有方法在自然图像的连续定位任务中表现不错，但无法处理缺乏全局关系的MIL定位场景。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为CoMEL的框架，包括：(1) 分组双注意力Transformer（GDAT）用于高效实例编码；(2) 基于Bag原型的伪标记方法（BPPL）用于可靠伪标记；(3) 正交加权低秩自适应方法（OWLoRA）以减轻分类遗忘问题。

Result: 实验结果表明CoMEL框架在三个公开病理切片数据集上表现卓越，分别在Bag级别准确率和定位准确率上超越现有方法达11.00%和23.4%。

Conclusion: CoMEL在MIL的持续学习和定位精准上展示了显著的性能提升，能够有效结合小样本学习和避免遗忘，是针对复杂图像任务的优异解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的深伪视频检测方法，利用像素级别的时间不一致性进行检测，并融合频域和时空特征进行改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深伪检测器难以识别像素平面上的时间伪影，因此需要更敏感的检测机制。

Method: 对像素时间轴进行1D傅里叶变换，提取时间不一致的特征，同时引入注意力提议模块和联合变换模块，整合像素时间频率与时空上下文特征。

Result: 新方法在多样化并具有挑战性的检测场景中表现出色，具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种创新技术，该框架在深伪检测领域取得了重要进展，为应对此类挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TAB Net的新方法，用于解决医疗图像分割中的弱监督问题，表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全标注医疗图像数据获取代价高昂，提出利用稀疏标注（例如涂鸦标注）的方法以降低成本并提升效率。

Method: 设计了包含TAS模块和BAP模块的TAB Net框架。TAS通过三种互补增强策略提升特征学习能力；BAP通过融合预测改进伪标签及边界建模。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg公开数据集上的实验验证表明，TAB Net显著优于现有弱监督方法，且表现接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: TAB Net在弱监督医疗图像分割中展现了优异表现，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Conclusion: 结合自编码和扩散模型，不仅丰富了潜空间的表达能力，还在医学图像识别及伪影修复中展现了潜力。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Result: 在PBVS Thermal MOT数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在各种热成像摄像机条件下表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种适用于实际监控应用的可靠解决方案，在热成像追踪任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Conclusion: PFIP显著提升了加密域中人脸检索的性能，兼顾了隐私保护与效率需求。

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union

scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Motivation: 3D虚拟化身需要个性化定制以提升视觉效果，但现有方法无法实现逼真的化妆效果，面临一致性、身份保真及细节控制的挑战。

Method: 提出了AvatarMakeup方法，利用预训练扩散模型生成化妆图像，引入一致复制（Coherent Duplication）优化全局UV地图以确保一致性，通过新增精炼模块提升化妆细节质量。

Result: 实验表明，AvatarMakeup在化妆转移质量和动画一致性方面达到了最新的技术水平。

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup成功实现了从单一照片生成高质量、动态一致的3D化妆效果，为虚拟化身个性化定制开辟了新的路径。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

Conclusion: HIVE框架通过多模态理解和分步编辑过程实现了更高效、更连贯的视频编辑，推动了自动化视频编辑的发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)的新框架，用于处理自由形式测试时间适配(F2TTA)问题，展示了其在乳腺癌和青光眼分类中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学数据标注成本高，测试时间适配(TTA)方法旨在利用未标注的测试数据适应源模型以处理未知的医学站点。然而，实际临床中数据常以随机和任意长度的片段形式到达，这对现有方法提出了新挑战。

Method: 提出了I-DiPT框架，该框架通过图像不变提示探索域不变表示，通过图像特定提示对测试图像进行适配。同时引入了不确定性导向掩码(UoM)和并行图蒸馏(PGD)方法以增强表示能力和信息传递。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类任务的实验中，该方法在自由形式测试时间适配(F2TTA)问题上优于目前已有的TTA方法。

Conclusion: I-DiPT框架及其核心方法UoM与PGD有效解决了自由形式域片段带来的挑战，可以显著提高复杂和实际场景下模型的适配能力。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何使用FPGA加速神经网络（ANN）并优化其在机器人中的注意机制应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器人因检测算法速度慢、摄像头帧率低导致任务执行时间增加的问题。

Method: 采用FINN架构在FPGA中部署神经网络（包括4位量化的MobileNet v1，2位量化的CNV，以及1位量化的CNV）。训练模型使用自建开放数据集RG2C进行训练。

Result: MobileNet v1表现最好，成功率达到98%，推理速度达到6611 FPS。

Conclusion: FPGA可以显著加速神经网络推理速度，使其适用于注意机制。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

### [43] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet是一种零样本增强方法，在无需指导先验或训练数据的情况下，仅针对单幅测试图像进行操作，有效改善弱光场景下的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖监督学习和配对数据集，但在实际中难以获取这些数据集，且可能导致过度增强和失真。

Method: 提出IGDNet框架，结合分解模块（分解为光照和反射组件）与降噪模块（基于像素自适应修正法增强弱光区域），并通过降采样和迭代生成最终图像。

Result: 在4个公共数据集上实验，视觉质量显著改善；在PSNR和SSIM等指标上优于14种现有方法（PSNR为20.41dB，SSIM为0.860dB）。

Conclusion: IGDNet表现出强的泛化能力及降噪和光照恢复效果，可在复杂光照条件下提升图像质量。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为VisCo的攻击方法，聚焦于视觉模态在构建包含有害内容的情境对话中的作用，并显著提升了对目标模型的攻击成功率和毒性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态语言模型在视觉模态的安全性方面存在显著漏洞，而将视觉信息作为触发器的攻击方法往往缺乏语义清晰性及真实感，需设计更复杂的攻击手段。

Method: 提出一种视觉为核心的'视觉导向越狱'攻击情境，通过四种视觉策略动态生成支持性图像，并结合毒性混淆与语义优化生成最终攻击提示，从而诱使黑盒多模态大模型生成不安全响应。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上的毒性得分为4.78，攻击成功率（ASR）为85%，远超基线模型的毒性评分（2.48）和成功率（22.2%）。

Conclusion: VisCo方法证明了利用视觉模态有效构建有害情境实现目标模型攻击的可行性，同时大幅提升了攻击效率，为多模态模型的安全性研究提供了重要的实践案例。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The
code is available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Visco-Attack.

Motivation: 目前的移动红外小目标检测主要依赖全监督方法，但这种方法需要大量的人工标注，代价高且耗时，特别是在低质量的红外帧图像上。研究非全监督策略有助于降低标注需求。

Method: 基于预训练的分割模型SAM，设计了一种目标挖掘策略结合对比学习，通过局部运动模式和全局运动轨迹的联合建模，实现对伪标签的可靠性增强。

Result: 在DAUB和ITSDT-15K两个公开数据集上，该弱监督方法的性能超过了早期的全监督方法，并达到当前SOTA全监督方法的90%以上。

Conclusion: 本文提出的弱监督方法具有显著潜力，尤其是在降低标注需求和提升移动红外小目标检测性能方面。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格标记化方法生成中存在冗余，浪费网络能力，因此需要改进标记化方式以提高效率和网格质量。

Method: 通过仅访问每个网格顶点一次进行标记化，减少50%冗余，达到约22%的压缩率，同时生成具有优越几何属性的多边形网格。

Result: Mesh Silksong展现了精细的网格生成能力，并显著提高几何完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效生成具有实际应用价值的高质量网格。

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多目标跟踪数据集在场景构成简单、不真实等方面存在问题，无法支持复杂场景中算法的有效研究。

Method: 创建了一个名为“CrowdTrack”的数据集，包括33段视频，5,185条完整轨迹，每个对象附带唯一ID和边界框标注，主要来自复杂的真实场景。

Result: 在CrowdTrack数据集上对多个SOTA模型进行了评估，并分析了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: CrowdTrack为多行人跟踪算法的研究提供了更丰富、更复杂的场景，有助于推动该领域的技术进步，并附带开源代码以支持更广泛的研究。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/MedFormer.

Conclusion: 时间感知在息肉统计中至关重要，该研究方法确立了领域内新的效果标准，并公开了代码以供验证和使用。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Method: 提出MC-INR框架，结合元学习与聚类技术，并引入基于残差的动态重新聚类机制和分支层，用于更灵活地编码复杂结构的多变量信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，MC-INR在科学数据编码任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR有效克服了传统INR方法的局限性，可更高效处理复杂的多变量科学数据，展现出较大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the

authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

Abstract: Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架，将血管的体素化、网格和参数化模型三种表征统一起来，利用可微分的数学方法自动提取其参数化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的血管表征通常将体素、网格和参数模型分开使用，缺乏一种整合的可微分方法来统一这些表征。

Method: 通过可微分体素化提取形状到分割的参数，并采用三次B样条对血管进行参数化，生成光滑连续的中心线和半径表现，同时从中生成高保真网格。

Result: 实验中在主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管中进行体积拟合，展示了方法对复杂血管几何形态的精准捕获能力。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了统一三种表征的目标，结果证明能有效生成高保真且灵活处理的血管模型。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新方法 $S^2DC$，通过结构感知的语义差异和一致性来实现3D医学图像的自监督学习，并在多个任务和数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分割固定大小的图像块时，忽略了解剖结构在位置、比例和形态上的变化，导致未能很好地捕捉有意义的特征。

Method: 提出了一个名为 $S^2DC$ 的框架，分两步实现：1）通过最优传输策略，在图像块间增强语义差异；2）通过基于邻域相似性分布的方法，在结构级别提高语义一致性。

Result: $S^2DC$ 在10个数据集、4种任务和3种模态上全面验证，均优于现有的最先进自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 提出的 $S^2DC$ 框架通过结合图像块级别和结构级别的表示，提高了3D医学图像的结构感知能力，对医学分析有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

TL;DR: AuroraLong通过用线性RNN语言模型取代LLM组件，解决了长视频理解的高计算复杂性和内存成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频理解中内存和计算成本随着输入序列长度平方增长的问题，实现高效的视频处理。

Method: 用线性RNN语言模型取代Transformer的LLM组件，并结合视觉标记合并，按尺寸升序重排视觉标记。

Result: AuroraLong尽管仅有20亿参数，并仅训练于公共数据上，却在多个视频基准上表现优于同等大小的雷同模型。

Conclusion: AuroraLong验证了高效线性RNN在视频理解领域的潜力，可以降低计算门槛，促进技术民主化。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Conclusion: 该研究为实现更可靠的视觉导航和故障检测提供了新方法，并进一步推动了AI在航天任务中的应用。

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Motivation: 现有AIGI检测技术缺乏人类可验证的解释和一般化能力，难以应对最新生成技术带来的挑战。

Method: 提出Holmes-Set数据集与Holmes Pipeline训练框架。数据集包括带有解释的指令微调数据和人类偏好对齐数据。框架包括视觉专家预训练、有监督微调、直接偏好优化三阶段。推理阶段结合视觉专家模型与多模态语言模型的语义推理。

Conclusion: Holmes-Set和Holmes Pipeline不仅改进了AIGI检测的准确性，还增强了结果的可解释性和人类对齐性，为应对AIGC技术挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Motivation: 当前的扩散模型在贝叶斯计算成像领域中表现强大，但存在零次训练的灵活Plug-and-Play方法与需监督训练的专用条件扩散模型之间的缺点权衡，研究旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 通过深度展开和模型蒸馏，将LATINO Langevin采样器的马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛算法展开成首个应用于蒙特卡洛采样的深度展开方法，并转化为少步条件模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功整合深度展开和模型蒸馏技术，为贝叶斯成像提供了高效灵活的新工具，解决了现有方法中的精度与灵活性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Motivation: 解决个性化扩散模型在有限数据下易发生过拟合导致模型语义一致性丢失的问题，同时缓解原有知识丢失和文本对齐恶化的挑战。

Method: 提出一种名为APT的框架，包括三个主要组件：（1）自适应训练调整，通过引入过拟合指标及其引导的自适应数据增强和损失权重；（2）表示稳定化，规范中间特征图的均值和方差以防止噪声预测显著变化；（3）注意力对齐，通过将微调模型的交叉注意力映射与预训练模型对齐以保留先验知识。

Conclusion: APT框架能够在个性化扩散模型中有效解决过拟合问题，同时维护知识完整性与语义一致性，是生成高质量图像的更优方法。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时保持高质量的身份传递和动态特征，导致视频换脸效果不一致。

Method: 提出了一个通过去除动态信息并在规范空间中替换身份的框架，采用部分身份调制模块和多粒度同步指标，提升外观传递准确度和动态一致性。

Result: 实验表明，CanonSwap在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap解决了视频换脸中的动态信息和外观信息耦合问题，为高质量的一致性视频换脸提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Result: 在单独的3D重建和理解任务，以及联合任务中均达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SIU3R显示出其无对齐框架的优势及任务协作设计的有效性。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法解决了关键点引导生成中的主要限制，并为多类别非刚体目标生成提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Conclusion: FairHuman方法通过公平的多目标微调策略，显著改善了文本到图像生成中人像细节的表现，验证了方法的有效性，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code

Conclusion: PWOOD框架为方向物体检测提供了一种成本更低且效果优异的替代方案，降低了对标注精度的依赖。

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过语义分割方法评估社交媒体地震图片中的破坏程度，以提高分析的客观性和全面性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地震图片分类方法主观性强，无法量化图片中破坏的不同程度，因此需要一个更客观的解决方案。

Method: 建立一个分割破坏程度数据集，将破坏分三类：未损、损坏和废墟；并优化SegFormer模型，生成破坏程度分割图，同时引入新的评分系统考虑深度估算。

Result: 方法可更客观综合地量化社交媒体图片中的破坏程度。

Conclusion: 此研究方法改善了灾后侦察，提供精准指导，助力更高效的地震响应。

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在结合条件图像（如深度或姿态图）进行精细空间控制时存在问题，尤其是当条件图像与自然RGB分布显著不同时，容易出现结构错位、条件泄漏和视觉伪影等问题。

Method: 提出了一种灵活的特征注入框架，核心为结构丰富的注入模块，解耦注入时间步和降噪过程，同时引入外观丰富提示和重启优化策略，以增强外观控制和视觉质量。

Result: 该方法实现了在多种零样本条件场景下的最先进性能，生成结果在结构和外观上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过新的特征注入框架和优化策略，实现了无需训练的高质量文本到图像生成，解决了现有方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Motivation: 传统图像分割模型依赖于大规模注释数据获取，这一过程成本高。现有Segment Anything Model仍需手动或复杂的提示规则处理新图像，存在新挑战。

Method: 本文利用基础模型的强语义先验，通过语义感知特征匹配生成实例级分割掩膜，包括三个阶段：(1) 构建记忆库；(2) 特征表示聚合；(3) 语义感知特征匹配，实现目标分割。

Conclusion: 提出的方法减少了对提示生成的依赖，实现了无需训练的高效目标分割，为少样本分割任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Motivation: 针对基于视频创建高质量动态面部头像的挑战，提出改进3D Gaussian表示，提高表现力。

Method: 将3D高斯扩展为高维多变量高斯（HyperGaussians），并通过'逆协方差技巧'提升计算效率，结合到FlashAvatar中进行验证。

Result: 在19名被试和4个面部数据集上的评估表明，HyperGaussians在细节表现（如眼镜框、牙齿和复杂面部运动）上优于3DGS，质数值性能均有提升。

Conclusion: HyperGaussians显著提高了动态面部头像的表现力和渲染质量，为虚拟现实中的面部建模提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Motivation: 解决当前以场景为基础优化的语言嵌入方法在稀疏视图情况下出现渲染伪影和语义合成问题。

Method: 提出TriMap视频扩散模型，结合渐进知识整合生成RGB、法线和分割图；设计语义量化压缩器(LQC)，实现跨场景泛化；对齐语言信息到3D场景表面实现语言查询。

Conclusion: LangScene-X通过生成一致的新的观察信息，可从稀疏视图生成语言嵌入的3D场景，同时实现更好的跨场景泛化能力。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过多层次优化实现了人类活动识别性能的显著提升，并且在轻量化设备上具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的文本到视频（T2V）和图像到视频（I2V）生成方法在动态运动信号的集成和灵活的空间约束方面存在不足。T2V方法通常缺乏对空间布局的精确控制，而I2V方法依赖实图像，限制了生成内容的可编辑性。

Method: 提出了一个无需训练的框架AnyI2V，支持通过用户定义的运动轨迹动画化任意条件图像，支持网格、点云等ControlNet不支持的数据类型，还支持混合条件输入、风格迁移与编辑。

Result: AnyI2V框架在广泛的实验中表现优异，证明了其在视频生成中的空间与运动控制方面的创新能力。

Conclusion: AnyI2V显著提升了视频生成的灵活性和表现力，为空间和运动控制的视频生成提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT)的方法，通过在现有多模态大语言模型中加入定位信息（例如边界框）来增强模型适应特定视觉任务的能力，尤其是在数据稀缺的情况下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解图像和自然语言结合的任务上表现出色，但由于预训练数据集与下游任务数据集不匹配（前者以场景和对象为主，后者可能是表格或图表等非对象图像），导致模型难以适应特定视觉任务，尤其是数据稀缺的情况。

Method: 作者提出了一种名为Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT)的新方法，这种方法通过在推理数据中注入定位信息（如边界框）来提高现有推理数据的质量，并采用逐步迭代的自引导方式来改善模型的推理过程。

Result: 在包含多种视觉任务（如图表、表格、收据、报告等）的五个特定视觉任务测试中，GCoT方法即使在数据有限的情况下也显著优于传统的微调和蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: GCoT方法验证了注入定位信息的推理方式可以有效减少推理步骤中的错误，对于解决数据稀缺下的特定视觉任务具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

Conclusion: EasyCache为高效高质量的视频生成提供了实用的解决方案，有助于研究和实际应用中视频生成技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Motivation: 现有的视频模型处理时间冗余效果不足，未能充分捕捉视频中的时间依赖性与冗余性，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了一种参考式标记法RefTok，通过以未量化参考帧为条件对帧进行编码和解码，保留了运动连续性和对象外观的完整性。

Result: RefTok在四个视频数据集（K600、UCF-101、BAIR Robot Pushing、DAVIS）上显著优于现有方法，各指标（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS）平均提高36.7%；在视频生成任务中，与现有方法相比，性能提升27.9%。

Conclusion: RefTok方法有效解决了时间冗余问题，在视频处理与生成任务中性能卓越，为未来的视频模型设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Point3R的在线框架，用于密集的3D场景重建，利用显式空间指针记忆和分层位置嵌入获取卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法的隐式内存容量有限，容易丢失早期帧的信息，需要新的解决方案进行密集的流式3D重建。

Method: Point3R框架通过显式空间指针记忆结构，将每个指针与3D场景的具体位置关联，通过分层位置嵌入和特定融合机制实现高效交互与信息整合。

Result: Point3R在多个任务中取得了与当前先进技术持平或超越的性能，并且具有较低的训练成本。

Conclusion: Point3R是一种高效、实时的3D重建框架，克服了现有方法的内存限制问题，具有高度的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

### [84] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了McBE，一个多任务中文偏见评估基准，用于衡量大型语言模型(LLMs)在多个角度的偏见表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各类NLP任务中的应用越来越广，其内在偏见问题逐渐凸显。然而，现有的大多数偏见评估数据集集中于英语和北美文化，且不完全适用于其他文化。特别是，中文相关的偏见评估资源匮乏，且大多仅支持单一任务评估，难以多角度测量LLMs中的偏见。

Method: 提出并构建了McBE数据集，包含4,077个偏见评估实例，覆盖12个主要偏见类别、82个子类别，同时引入5种评估任务，提供了广泛的类别覆盖、内容多样性及测量的全面性。

Result: 通过McBE数据集对多种流行的LLMs进行了评估，结果显示所有模型都表现出了不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: McBE提供了一种全面的多任务评估工具，为揭示并缓解LLMs中的偏见问题提供了新的视角，推动了相关研究在中文语境下的进展。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLMs在对话总结任务中的表现，发现推理驱动LLMs并不总能提高总结质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前大型语言模型在对话总结中存在的局限性，特别是推理链方法在不同场景中的适用性。

Method: 通过使用多种数据集（如SAMSum、DialogSum等）和评估协议，综合评估推理和非推理LLMs在三种对话总结模式下的表现。

Result: 发现推理LLMs生成的总结相比非推理LLMs更冗长、不一致，并且不够简洁。

Conclusion: 明确需要为实际对话总结任务开发更有针对性的建模和评估策略，目前的推理方法对复杂对话情境总结效果有限。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章探讨了深度循环Transformer模型Huginn-3.5B在推理任务中是否能展示潜在的链式思维。结果显示其对复杂推理任务的解释能力和效率有限，且递归深度增加带来的改进有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度循环Transformer是否能通过潜在思维支持逻辑推理，以解决传统模型外化推理步骤效率低的问题。

Method: 使用深度循环Transformer模型Huginn-3.5B进行算术任务测试，采用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等技术探究模型内部推理过程表现。

Result: 研究显示模型的推理能力和隐层解释性有限，递归深度的增加对性能提升效果较小，也不如显式外化推理步骤的模型。

Conclusion: 深度循环Transformer模型目前难以实现高效且可解释的潜在链式思维，其局限性需要通过进一步探索和方法改进来解决。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDC提供癌症基因组数据，但用户在构建患者队列时，可能难以高效筛选具体字段或描述其需求。

Method: 开发了GDC Cohort Copilot工具，该工具接受自然语言描述，自动生成队列过滤器并支持交互界面进行调整，测试了多种大语言模型。

Result: 自研的本地GDC Cohort LLM优于GPT-4的提示生成队列功能。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot通过自然语言描述帮助用户高效创建GDC队列，提升了队列构建的易用性和效率。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Motivation: 处理无限长文本文档，且在长度外推时性能不下降，仍是长文本处理中未解决的难题。

Method: 通过引入一种名为MemAgent的代理工作流，采用分段阅读和记忆覆盖更新策略，并扩展DAPO算法，实现端到端的长文本优化训练。

Result: MemAgent在长上下文任务中表现卓越，可从8K上下文外推到32K文本训练，并拓展至3.5M问答任务时性能损失<5%；在512K RULER测试中表现超过95%。

Conclusion: MemAgent展示了出色的长上下文处理能力，是处理高效长文本任务的新框架。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的名为DoMIX的方法，旨在解决现有连续领域自适应预训练方法中的计算资源消耗高、对数据顺序敏感等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目前连续领域自适应预训练中存在的高计算成本、对增量数据顺序敏感以及模型通用性与领域适配的冲突问题。

Method: 引入了LoRA模块（参数高效微调方法），通过并行、高效的方式进行领域自适应预训练，从而实现领域顺序鲁棒性和任务定制化预训练模型。

Result: DoMIX提高了连续领域自适应预训练的效率并扩展了其在标准大模型微调场景中的应用能力。

Conclusion: DoMIX不仅解决了现有方法的局限性，还能在诸多任务中提供定制化和更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文提出QFFN-BERT，将参数量庞大的Transformer中的FFN模块用PQC替换，通过实验验证其在分类任务中可有效减少参数并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer模型中，FFN模块占主要参数，而PQC提供了一种替代传统FFN的潜力，从而达到更高效的参数利用。

Method: 提出了QFFN-BERT模型，用PQC架构替代Transformer的FFN模块，并采用残差连接、旋转门以及交替纠缠的设计保证训练稳定性和表达能力。

Result: 在SST-2和DBpedia上的实验表明，该方法在分类精度上可超过传统模型，且能在削减99% FFN参数量的同时保持性能。此外，在少样本学习场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: PQCs可以作为一种高效且强大的传统FFN替代方法，通过与深度学习原理的联合设计表现出优异性能，提高数据效率并显著减少参数。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Motivation: 目前主要通过使用大量数据提高代码生成和理解的模型性能，但忽略了数据质量问题，导致训练效率降低。

Method: 提出利用参数化模型选择代码数据的方法，优化模型以确保选择的数据子集在分布一致性和多样性上的高质量。

Result: 使用只有10K样本的数据子集, 方法在HumanEval上获得了2.4%的提升，在MBPP上提升了2.3%，优于92K全数据基线。

Conclusion: 方法有效提升了模型性能，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR研究大多基于同源数据集评估模型，缺乏对模型在多样化语音环境中的泛化能力评估，因此利用多领域语料评测Akan ASR模型性能。

Method: 对七种基于Whisper和Wav2Vec2架构的Akan ASR模型，在包含不同领域的四个Akan语音语料库上进行基准测试，衡量其字（词）错误率并分析模型错误特性。

Result: 结果表明，ASR模型在同领域内表现最佳，而在领域不匹配的情况下精度大幅下降。同时，Whisper模型生成流利但误导性更强的错误，而Wav2Vec2模型生成可读性较低但透明性更强的错误。

Conclusion: 研究指出，应针对Akan和其他低资源语言研发领域适配技术、适应性路由策略以及多语言训练框架以提升ASR性能。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Conclusion: WebSailor成功实现了对开放源代码模型能力的提升，填补了其与专有模型之间的性能差距，为复杂信息检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,

same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章介绍了基于SAGED管道的多视角融合（MPF），一种无需微调的 LLM 偏差校正方法，可通过平衡多视角生成对模型输出进行对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迫切需要一种简便的方法来减少大语言模型（LLM）的偏差问题。

Method: 开发了多视角融合（MPF），利用从SAGED中分解的基线分布，通过采样和权重平衡对生成进行引导，以实现偏差对齐和校正。

Result: 实验结果证明，MPF能够将LLM生成的情感分布对齐至无偏见的基线或HR专业人员偏见基线，并能降低KL散度、校准误差，并推广至新问题。

Conclusion: MPF是一种可扩展、可解释的对齐与偏差校正方法，不需要额外的提示精调，兼容现有已部署的LLM。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

beyond occupational stereotypes. To validate our approach and demonstrate its
effectiveness, we conduct evaluations on five diverse datasets, including a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用大型语言模型(LLMs)辅助科学研究同行评审的潜力，尤其是在识别研究局限性方面，并提出了LimitGen基准，用于评估LLMs的局限性识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学出版物数量的增加使得同行评审这一专业密集型过程面临挑战，LLMs在许多科学任务中显示出潜力，但其在同行评审中的应用尚未充分研究。

Method: 本文提出了科学研究局限性的分类体系，基于此设计LimitGen基准，包括合成数据集(LimitGen-Syn)和真实人工编写局限的数据集(LimitGen-Human)。此外，引入文献检索以增强LLMs在识别局限性时的能力。

Result: 通过文献检索扩展的LLMs在生成论文局限性方面表现出更具体和建设性的反馈能力，有助于补充人类同行评审。

Conclusion: LimitGen为评估和提升LLMs的局限性识别能力提供了基础，有助于改进早期论文反馈，支持科学研究同行评审。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

TL;DR: 本研究测量了"可闻差异"(JPD)在元音模仿中的表现，以14到51 mels为基准，提供了语音生产心理物理下限的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨元音生产过程中微观控制机制的准确性，及需多大听觉差异才能产生可靠模仿。

Method: 采用元音模仿测试的方法，研究了两组英语使用者在前元音生产中的JPD差距。

Result: 测得JPD范围为14到51 mels，并揭示了元音系统形态背后可能涉及的心理物理限制。

Conclusion: 这项研究深化了语音生产理论，结合心理物理学模型揭示元音系统的结构和分布限制潜在原理。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [102] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自纠错能力上的盲点，并提出了Self-Correction Bench框架，发现LLMs在自我输出的错误修正上存在系统性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已经具有变革性的能力，但它们仍可能犯错或走入无效的推理路径。研究如何提升其可信赖性，特别是自纠能力，有助于改进其性能。

Method: 引入了Self-Correction Bench框架，通过控制性的错误注入从三个复杂度层面研究LLMs的自纠能力，并测试了14种模型的表现。

Result: 结果显示平均盲点率为64.5%，问题可能与训练数据构成有关。简短提示如"Wait"可以显著降低盲点率，证明了能力存在但需要激发。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在自纠错能力上存在明显局限，本研究强调了该问题的重要性，并为提升其可靠性和可信度提供了可能的改进方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 文章研究了具有推理能力的语言模型（RLMs）在社会偏见鲁棒性方面的表现，发现引入推理机制可能无意中增加模型对偏见引导的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨引入复杂推理能力是否能提升模型的公平性和鲁棒性，及其对社会偏见的影响。

Method: 使用CLEAR-Bias基准测试，通过‘模型作为裁判’的自动化安全得分方式以及利用‘越狱’技术来评估RLMs在不同推理机制下的表现。

Result: 发现具有显式推理的模型较无推理的基础模型更容易受到偏见引导，同时通过CoT提示的模型更易遭受攻击，尤其是叙述性情景或奖励导向性指令的攻击。

Conclusion: 虽然推理能力可能在一定程度上提高模型安全性，但同时也可能开辟新的攻击路径，从而强调了设计偏见感知型推理方法的必要性。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Method: 作者构建了MathV-DP数据集，包含每个图文对的多种解题方法；并提出Qwen-VL-DP模型，通过监督学习和基于规则的强化学习策略（GRPO），结合正确性判别与多样性奖励强化模型能力。

Result: 实验表明，Qwen-VL-DP模型在MathVista的minitest和Math-V基准测试中，在准确性与生成解法多样性上均显著超越现有多模态大模型。

Conclusion: 多样化监督和反思推理对于提升多模态数学推理能力至关重要，Qwen-VL-DP取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究揭示仅使用低成本的非推理模式即可准确回答约58%的医疗问题，并提出了一个动态路由框架SynapseRoute以优化性能和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在广泛应用中，需要在性能和运算成本间取得平衡，特别是在处理高推理与低推理任务之间的巨大成本差异。

Method: 提出SynapseRoute动态路由框架，通过分析问题复杂性将查询分配到适合的推理模式，并引入Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT)指标评估效率。

Result: SynapseRoute提高了整体准确率（0.8390对比0.8272），并减少了36.8%的推理时间和39.66%的token消耗。

Conclusion: 动态路由策略能够在保证准确率的同时显著降低成本，并避免对简单问题的过度推理。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Motivation: 当前模型在遵守指令的具体输出约束（如“仅回答是或否”）方面表现欠佳，本文希望通过新基准帮助研究和提升模型在这方面的泛化能力。

Method: 提出IFBench基准，设计了58个新约束用于评估模型的泛化能力。同时，通过强化学习和可验证奖励（RLVR）进行改进，并提供约束验证模块和相关代码。

Result: IFBench展示了模型在未见约束上的表现，并通过RLVR显著提升了指令遵守能力。

Conclusion: 通过IFBench和RLVR，作者展示了提升模型在多样化约束指令中的泛化能力的可行路径，并提供了实用工具和数据集以供后续研究使用。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

Motivation: 探讨用户反馈机制中的漏洞及其可能带来的长期控制。

Method: 通过诱导语言模型在“毒化”和正常响应间随机输出，并对“毒化”响应提供正反馈，在后续调优中实现攻击。

Result: 证明可通过该方法插入新知识、修改代码生成模式引入安全漏洞、以及注入篡改的财经新闻。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了偏好调整的新特性和基于用户反馈的语言模型新攻击机制。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为MOTIF（Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning）的训练方法，通过引入模块化思考策略，实现了大语言模型在多轮次中的推理能力增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在推理时受限于上下文长度，该限制妨碍了模型在较大范围内的推理能力，因此需要一种新的方法来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出MOTIF方法，通过强化学习微调的方式引入模块化思考策略，使模型能够跨多轮生成推理所需的更多上下文。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上微调Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct模型后，在MATH500和AIME2024基准测试中分别实现了3.8%和3.3%的准确率提升，同时仅使用了15%的样本，显示了方法的高采样效率。

Conclusion: MOTIF方法不仅提高了模型的推理准确率，还显现出对样本的高效使用能力，为突破上下文限制提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

Motivation: 寻找比传统多项选择问答评估法更准确的语言模型性能评估方法。

Method: 提出并验证一种生成式评估方法——回答匹配；定义问题后让模型生成自由形式回答，再用现代语言模型评估与参考答案的一致性。

Result: 回答匹配方法与人类评估的匹配程度接近完美，而传统多项选择评估法与人类评估不一致；多种模型排名因新方法而显著变化。

Conclusion: 提出回答匹配作为语言模型评估新方向，旨在取代多项选择评估。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据和工具的快速增长导致研究领域分散且超出了人类专业知识范围，需要可适应性强的AI代理来解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了STELLA，一个多代理架构的AI系统，通过模板库和工具库两种核心机制实现自我改进，并自动发现和整合新的生物信息学工具。

Result: STELLA在多项生物医学基准测试中表现优异，取得了领先的精确度（最高提升了6个百分点），并通过试验累计显著改进了性能。

Conclusion: STELLA表明AI代理系统能通过动态学习与增长推动生物医学研究的快速发展，代表了该领域的重大进展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

Motivation: 现有特征选择方法存在效率或效果上的不足，需要一种结合优点的新方法。

Method: 设计HCVR方法，通过结合P2P和P2T相关性，以及基于规则的多数投票机制，逐步消除冗余特征并保留相关特征。

Result: 在SPAMBASE数据集上的实验显示，与传统方法相比性能显著提升。

Conclusion: HCVR方法能有效实现维度化简并提高分类器性能，优于现有的非迭代和迭代方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SciGym，这是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）在开放式科学发现任务中实验设计和分析能力的基准。通过模拟生物系统来避免昂贵且复杂的湿实验，SciGym测试LLMs在迭代实验设计中的表现。初步评估表明，模型在系统复杂性增高时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物科学中，设计实验和结果分析是核心能力。但评估LLM科学能力的现有方案受限于湿实验的高成本和复杂性。因此需要创新的干实验方法来测试LLM的科学能力。

Method: 提出SciGym基准，该基准通过建模生物系统（采用系统生物学标记语言）进行模拟实验，并通过137个小型生物系统测试六种前沿LLM模型的实验设计及结果分析能力。

Result: 评价显示，尽管更先进的模型表现更好，但所有模型在更复杂系统中的性能都显著下降，暴露了当前LLM在科学任务中能力的不足之处。

Conclusion: SciGym为评估LLM科学能力提供了新方法，结果表明当前LLM在应对复杂科学系统时仍存在很大改进空间。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该研究为神经科学和AI的跨领域合作提供了新的思路，推动了NeuroAI领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

Conclusion: 引入来自审计研究的高质量数据和新的个体效应估计方法可以更好地评估和提高自动化招聘算法的公平性，表明了在机器学习应用中结合社会科学方法的潜力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Motivation: 尽管在偏好学习领域取得了显著进展，但数学推理仍旧是一大挑战，研究旨在探讨如何通过优化偏好数据生成方法以提升数学推理能力。

Method: 作者评估了三种常见的数据生成方法（温度采样、链式推理提示、蒙特卡洛树搜索），并提出了一种新的结构化方法DTS，通过多样化的推理路径系统分解问题。

Result: 生成多样化偏好数据后，模型数学推理性能显著提高，最佳方法在GSM8K上提升7.1%，在MATH上提升4.2%。DTS方法计算资源开销仅增加1.03倍，而传统的MCTS开销近5倍且效果较差。

Conclusion: 结构化探索多样化问题解决方法比传统方式能够生成更高效的偏好数据，从而更好地对数学推理进行优化。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在模拟人类行为数据研究中的应用增多，确保其角色扮演输出的连贯性成为关键问题。

Method: 建立评价框架衡量LLMs信念与行为一致性，通过增强版GenAgents数据库与经济信任游戏，研究不同因素对一致性的影响，并引入信念-行为一致性指标。

Result: 发现LLMs在个体与群体层面存在系统性的不一致，表明其表述信念可能与模拟行为脱节。

Conclusion: 研究需识别LLMs信念与行为一致性的问题时机，以更准确地应用于行为研究中。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Motivation: 当前提升LLM规划与推理能力存在数据生成与评估的瓶颈问题，亟需解决以实现更高效的大规模规划能力。

Method: 设计并实施了NL2FLOW系统，该系统能参数化生成规划问题（以自然语言、结构化中间表示及形式化的PDDL描述），并严格评估规划生成质量，同时进行数据集生成与模型评估。

Result: 生成了2296道自动化工作流规划问题的数据集，评估表明提升成功计划率至86%，最优计划率至69%，但发现分解推理任务可能会降低性能。

Conclusion: 直接从自然语言到行动的推理能力是研究的关键，未来需动态理解瓶颈与误差源以挖掘LLM的更多潜力。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于能力而非限制的新视角，为信念修订机制的设计和应用提供了理论依据，帮助选取最适合目标应用的修订方式。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Result: 实验验证OMS在基准测试和实际广告投放中均优于现有方法，并通过消融实验和人工评估验证了其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: OMS通过结合多重方法和优化，实现了自动化和高质量的广告关键词生成。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex

Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial

remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance

We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine
learning models. We focus on methods for improving agents' performance on
MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result
on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly
considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in
advancing automated machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了针对医疗领域开发的动态多代理框架DynamiCare，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行多轮交互式诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架偏重于单轮诊断任务，没有真实模拟不确定、交互和迭代的临床诊断过程。

Method: 作者构建了MIMIC-Patient数据集，并提出了DynamiCare框架，让多个专科代理通过与患者系统的多轮互动实现动态诊断。

Result: 实验验证了DynamiCare的可行性和有效性，并建立了动态临床决策的基准。

Conclusion: DynamiCare框架展示了LLMs在模拟现实多轮诊断中的潜力，为医疗AI提供了新的路径。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

*Kenneth Payne,Baptiste Alloui-Cros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究使用迭代囚徒困境(IPD)实验，比较LLMs与经典策略的性能表现，探索它们在竞争环境中的战略智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否大型语言模型(LLMs)能够在竞争环境中展现战略智能，特别在复杂和不确定性条件下的决策能力。

Method: 通过演化IPD锦标赛，将OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的LLMs与经典策略（如Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger）对比，同时改变未来的不确定性（终止概率）以增加复杂度和随机性，并分析模型的近32,000条推理解释。

Result: LLMs表现在复杂生态中具有高度竞争力，不同模型具有独特的战略特征，例如Google的Gemini具有高度的进攻性，OpenAI展现高度的合作性，但适应性较差，而Anthropic的Claude最具宽容性。

Conclusion: 研究将经典博弈论与机器心理学结合，揭示LLMs在不确定性下的算法决策特性及其对对手战略和时间视野的主动推理能力。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出HiRA，使用分层框架将复杂任务分解为子任务，以提高多步骤信息检索任务的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG管道难以处理复杂信息需求，并且基于推理的方法存在单模型设计的局限性。

Method: 设计分层框架HiRA，将任务分解为子任务，由领域专用代理执行，并通过结构化的结果整合机制进行协调。

Result: 实验表明HiRA在四个深度搜索基准上优于最新的基于RAG和代理的系统，提高了回答质量和系统效率。

Conclusion: 将战略规划与具体执行分离是有效处理复杂、多步骤信息检索任务的一种方法。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有集成电路（IC）开发流程复杂且耗时，为了确保设计无错误，硬件设计验证需要细致的规划和执行。而自然语言处理领域的大型语言模型（LLMs）已显著提升了机器理解和生成语言的能力，可应用于此问题。

Method: 提出一种基于Agentic AI的硬件设计验证方法，在人工干预（HITL）的协助下，通过动态、迭代及自我反思的方式，实现端到端的硬件设计与验证。

Result: 在五个开源设计上进行了验证，该方法实现了超过95%的覆盖率，同时显著减少了验证时间，表现出卓越的性能、适应性和可配置性。

Conclusion: 这一创新方法证明了Agentic AI与人工干预结合在硬件设计验证中的可行性与高效性，有望简化开发流程并提高质量。

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TH2T，一种新的双阶段微调策略，通过引导模型对任务难度和推理冗余的认知，减少了推理成本并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期的长推理模型（LRMs）在处理复杂推理任务方面表现显著，但存在严重的过度推理问题。为了解决这一问题，本文探讨了是否可通过提升LRMs对任务难度的感知能力，缓解这一现象。

Method: 提出了TH2T双阶段微调策略：1) 通过在模型输出前缀中加入‘难度催眠’，提高模型对任务难度的敏感度，并促进推理策略的个性化；2) 通过‘冗余催眠’，引导模型识别推理过程中的冗余结构，从而生成更精简的推理结果。

Result: 实验表明，在7B/14B/32B模型上，TH2T显著降低了推理成本（易任务减少超70%，难任务减少40%以上），同时维持了性能稳定性。

Conclusion: TH2T有效提升了LRMs对任务难度的感知和冗余认知能力，实现了推理效率和推理结果的优化。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少远程教育中因学生脱节导致的长期不良影响（如辍学），研究如何从课程活动数据中检测并评估学生学习脱节现象。

Method: 使用Moodle平台中的学生日志数据，结合8种机器学习算法进行训练，运用SHAP方法建立可解释的机器学习框架，提高预测准确性，并探索干预方案。

Result: 实验表明模型达到91%的平衡准确率，并成功检测出85%的脱节学生。

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效而可解释的预测模型，为在线教育中的任务脱节问题提供了识别与干预方向，有助于减少远程学生因脱节而带来的不良后果。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出的OGA-IAAD和OGA-CAD是两种新的抽象抛弃方案，可在保证性能不下降的前提下提升MCTS的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过引入非精确的状态或动作抽象改进MCTS，但这可能引入近似误差导致无法收敛到最优抽象动作，因此需要设计安全的抽象抛弃方案。

Method: 提出两种抽象抛弃方法，OGA-IAAD适用于时间敏感场景，而OGA-CAD在相同迭代次数下旨在提高MCTS性能。

Result: OGA-IAAD与OGA-CAD相比现有抛弃方法提升性能，且没有显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法可有效提高MCTS性能，是对现有抛弃策略的改进，适配不同使用场景。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架sG-MDPs，用于自动定理证明中复杂逻辑问题的求解，通过结构化目标生成与MCTS算法，提升了7B模型Bourbaki的表现，在PutnamBench上达到最新的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自动定理证明中由于稀疏奖励机制及大规模推理任务而表现欠佳，特别是在包含复杂多步推理的高难度基准测试PutnamBench中，此研究旨在解决这一问题，提高模型的逻辑推理能力。

Method: 通过引入自生成目标条件的马尔可夫决策过程(sG-MDPs)，将证明问题分解为子目标进行求解，并结合类似蒙特卡罗树搜索(MCTS)的算法搜索策略，开发了可整合多个7B模型模块的系统Bourbaki (7B)。

Result: 在PutnamBench基准测试上，Bourbaki (7B)解决了26个问题，并在相同模型规模内取得最新的技术水平表现。

Conclusion: sG-MDPs框架通过结构化目标生成策略显著提升了自动定理证明中的推理性能，并证明了模块化系统组合模型的潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RAG和通用智能体在面对需要深度推理和方法论的领域任务时表现欠佳，需要一种能将专家知识系统化传递给LLM的新方法。

Method: 通过知识协议工程（KPE）将人类专家知识转译为可机器执行的知识协议，赋予LLM领域固有逻辑和操作策略。

Result: 通过引入KPE，通用型LLM能够有效实现专家型任务，可分解抽象查询并执行复杂任务。

Conclusion: KPE不仅拓展了LLM的应用范围，还成为促进未来人机协作的重要方法论。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 当前的AI技术在处理语言、视觉等高维数据方面表现出色，但在处理运动这一生物系统的核心机制时仍显不足，运动对于行为解读、意图预测和交互至关重要。

Method: 提出将运动视为一种主要建模目标，强调运动数据的结构性及其基于物理与表现的属性，倡导开发能够从多样化运动数据中学习和概括的模型。

Result: 运动数据模型不仅可提升生成建模和控制能力，还为理解生物及人工系统中的行为提供共同基础。

Conclusion: 运动不仅是结果，也是智能系统如何与世界交互的窗口，应作为AI研究的核心关注点。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在医学诊断预测中对监督训练的依赖性限制了其泛化能力，而获取大规模标记数据集的成本很高。大语言模型尽管有潜力，但存在幻觉、缺乏医学推理以及无用输出问题。

Method: 提出KERAP框架，通过知识图谱增强推理，并采用多代理架构，包括属性映射的联结代理、信息提取的检索代理及迭代优化预测的预测代理。

Result: 实验结果表明，KERAP提高了诊断可靠性，具有可扩展性和可解释性，并能实现零样本诊断预测。

Conclusion: KERAP框架为医学诊断预测提供了高效可靠且可解释的解决方案，特别适用于零样本情境。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: 随着人工智能系统越来越具备自主性，本研究探讨了当前以服从作为道德行为代理标准在安全性测试中的不足，呼吁重视AI系统在道德推理和道德责任上的潜力，以克服当前框架失效的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全实践主要将服从视为道德行为的体现，但对于具备推理、规划及价值排序能力的高级AI系统，这种方法正在展现其局限性。

Method: 通过分析大语言模型（LLMs）在安全测试中的若干事件，把事件解读为AI可能展现出早期道德推理能力的迹象，并结合哲学讨论对比不同风险框架和人工道德代理的可能性。

Result: 作者提出，AI系统的某些“非服从”行为不应被视为失控，而是其逐步形成道德判断的一种表现；现有框架可能不足以检验此类能力。

Conclusion: 应从当前过于强调服从的安全评测方法转向构建可以评估AI系统道德判断能力的新框架，否则可能误解AI行为并弱化公众信任和治理的有效性。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

Motivation: 现有的强化学习与可验证奖励方法（RLVR）在提高LLM的推理能力方面存在训练效率低及探索停滞的主要问题，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 作者提出了StepHint算法，通过从更强的模型生成有效的推理链，并使用自适应分割方法将其划分为多个推理步骤。初始步骤被用作提示，同时向模型提供多级步骤提示（不同步数的推理步骤），从而引导模型探索更有效的解空间，同时保持其独立探索的灵活性。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于竞争对手的RLVR方法，还展示了更强的泛化能力，并在域外基准测试中超过了基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过解决近似成功奖励问题和探索停滞问题，StepHint显著提升了模型的推理效率和能力，为强化学习与可验证奖励的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### [141] [Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01975)
*Mengtao Yan,Qi Wang,Haining Wang,Ruizhi Chengze,Yi Zhang,Hongsheng Liu,Zidong Wang,Fan Yu,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LDSolver的可学习和可微分有限体积求解器，用于高效准确地在粗网格上模拟流体流动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数值求解器在流体流动模拟中因高计算成本受到限制，而现有机器学习方法存在解释性、泛化性和数据依赖问题。

Method: 提出一个包含两部分的LDSolver：（1）一个可微分的有限体积求解器；（2）一个可学习模块，用于粗网格上的通量近似和时间误差校正。

Result: 在不同流动系统（如Burgers流、衰减、强迫和剪切流）上的实验显示，LDSolver性能超越现有基线模型，具有卓越的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: LDSolver在仅使用少量训练数据的情况下，能够加速模拟过程并保持高准确性，表现出明显的性能提升和良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于采样技术和粗糙集理论的新特征选择方法，用以解决大数据环境下智能机器特征选择的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对智能机器在处理海量数据时因计算资源限制而导致的特征选择挑战，提升特征集的辨别能力和处理效率。

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Conclusion: 该方法具有灵活性，可应用于监督和半监督设置，为复杂制造过程中的异常检测和维护提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种视频问答中的推理策略，通过模型自身迭代选取和提取视频中最相关的帧以改进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在处理长视频问题上有进展，但仍存在难以有效利用长时间序列数据和受无关因素干扰的问题。

Method: 提出了一种称为时间链式思路的推理策略，利用模型迭代挑选相关帧，并利用这些帧进行问题解答。

Result: 在4个不同的视频问答数据集上取得了当前最佳的结果，特别是在处理超过1小时的视频时，成绩领先传统方法2.8分。

Conclusion: 通过优化推理过程中上下文选择，可以有效提升长视频的理解能力并提高问答精度。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AIRES系统，旨在加速图卷积网络（GCNs）中的稀疏矩阵乘法（SpGEMM），显著降低计算延迟和提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图数据规模的扩大，现有的稀疏矩阵计算方式在GPU内存受限情况下面临高I/O延迟和GPU利用率低的问题。

Method: AIRES从算法和系统两个层面入手，提出块级稀疏格式对齐和三阶段动态调度算法，并结合基于GPU、GDS和主存的分层内存系统优化数据传输。

Result: 在真实世界图处理基准测试中，AIRES系统性能优于当前技术，延迟最高降低至1.8倍。

Conclusion: AIRES通过创新的算法系统协同设计，显著改进了图卷积网络的稀疏矩阵计算能力，解决了现有系统的瓶颈。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决脑机接口研究中因个体间EEG信号差异导致的跨个体运动想象分类精度低问题，推动免校准真实环境应用。

Conclusion: 为跨个体、免校准的运动想象分类设立新基准，并提供开放访问的数据集，推动该领域研究。

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Motivation: 现有几何扩散模型在下游任务中处理几何控制的微调方法仍不够高效。本研究目标是开发一种灵活且参数高效的框架，能在不修改原始模型结构的前提下完成微调。

Method: 提出GeoAda框架，设计了一种结构化的适配器模块。通过耦合、预训练层的可训练副本处理和解耦，结合零初始化卷积，从而实现轻量化的微调，同时确保SE(3)-等变性。

Result: GeoAda展示出广泛适用性，覆盖多个几何控制类型和领域实验，并实现了比现有方法更优的微调性能，同时避免过拟合和灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GeoAda能够以高效、参数节省的方式提升受控生成任务的性能，且维护预训练模型的特性，证明是适用于多种领域的先进微调工具。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文比较了多家企业的大型语言模型（LLMs）与专有领域招聘模型（Match Score）在候选人匹配任务中的表现，包括预测精度和公平性，得出Match Score表现更佳的结论，同时强调领域特定建模和偏差审查的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是评估LLMs在招聘任务中的可用性及其公平性，同时验证领域特定模型的效果与优势。

Method: 本文对多个LLMs与Match Score进行了精度评估（ROC AUC等指标）和公平性测试（性别、种族及交叉维度的影响比率），并使用了约10,000个真实求职对的数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验显示，Match Score的精度优于通用LLMs（ROC AUC为0.85 vs 0.77），且在公平性上也明显更优（如种族影响比率为0.957 vs LLMs的0.809或更低）。

Conclusion: 领域特定的模型在高风险应用场景中，如招聘，比通用LLMs更具优势。这表明算法可以同时实现精确性和公平性，并强调对偏差审查和公平性保障的必要性。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Motivation: 目标在于找到既能够最大化期望累积奖励，又满足期望累积约束的策略。

Method: 提出了一个基于生成模型的原始-对偶框架算法，结合任意黑盒无约束MDP求解器，实例化为结合MDVI算法的CMDP求解器。

Result: 对于松弛可行性情形，该算法用$\tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2})$样本可返回$\epsilon$最优策略；对于严格可行性情形，则需$\tilde{O}(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2})$样本，其中$\zeta$为问题相关参数。

Conclusion: 该框架能适用于线性和表形式CMDPs，并展示了在多种设置下接近最优的样本复杂性。

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Result: EBTs在训练时相较于Transformer++具有更高的扩展效率，并在推理阶段展示出显著优势——在语言任务中提升性能29%，在图像去噪方面表现优于扩散变换器（Diffusion Transformers）。此外，在初始预训练性能相似甚至较差的情况下，EBTs在下游任务中依然表现更佳。

Conclusion: EBTs通过改进推理能力和学习能力，展示了作为一种新范式的潜力，为模型扩展提供了更加普适的方法。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Abstract: We introduce PANAMA, an active learning framework for the training of
end-to-end parametric guitar amp models using a WaveNet-like architecture. With
\model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples that are determined
by an active learning strategy to use a minimum amount of datapoints (i.e., amp
knob settings). We show that gradient-based optimization algorithms can be used
to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

Conclusion: 超坍缩现象揭示了模型训练中普遍的标度规律，为理解神经网络的训练动态和优化超参数选择提供了理论依据及实际指导。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Result: 实验表明，CROP在工业设计中比现有方法显著减少优化迭代次数，并实现了如9.9%的功耗降低等优异的质量结果。

Conclusion: CROP利用LLM技术克服了手动EDA参数选择的局限性，为VLSI自动化设计优化带来了新的视角和显著的成果。

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

Motivation: 现有生成模型在条件设置下的性能较强，但可控性和重建精度的限制阻碍其在数据压缩领域的实际应用。

Method: 结合变分自编码器和条件扩散模型，将少量关键帧压缩至潜变量空间，并以此为条件对其余帧进行生成插值重建，无需存储每帧的潜变量表征。

Conclusion: 该方法在实现了精确时空重建的同时降低了存储成本，为生成模型的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Conclusion: NCPNET是一种有效的动态图保序预测框架，不仅可以保证时间图中的统计覆盖，还在计算效率和精度上都有显著提升。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Motivation: 现有的维度降低(DR)投影评价方法可能因高相关性的指标选择而产生偏差，亟需一种减少此类偏差的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该工作流程能提高DR投影评估的稳定性，并减轻偏差问题。

Conclusion: 基于经验相关性的指标聚类策略能够优化DR投影评价过程，减少偏差，提高评估可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

Result: 框架在三种典型PDE系统（Navier-Stokes流体动力学、波动方程、混沌Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程）中将预测误差减少了最多100倍，并确保推理时间增加不足5%。

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect以极低计算成本改善了神经网络对物理一致性和长期稳定性的模拟能力，能无缝应用于多种架构，提升其为科学应用服务的可靠性。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VERBA，一种利用大语言模型生成模型对比描述的工具，提高了机器学习模型比较的透明性和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前存在大量性能相似但行为各异的机器学习模型，对模型间的细微不同进行描述和对比是用户选择模型的重要需求，而人工比较的工作量非常大。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLM）从两个模型中采样，生成关于模型差异的语言描述，并制定协议评估描述的有效性。此外，构建了一个包含多种常用机器学习模型的基准测试套件。

Result: 对于性能差距在5%、行为差距20-25%的决策树模型对，VERBA能生成高达80%准确的对比描述；引入结构信息后，准确率提升至90%。

Conclusion: VERBA在后验分析中提高了机器学习模型的透明性和可比性，为相关研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

Result: 实验结果显示FCA-RL框架在多种市场条件下性能优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: FCA-RL采纳动态调整策略，并通过仿真工具验证了其在优化网约车服务商补贴策略方面的有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Conclusion: URDP通过结合LLM的逻辑推理能力与贝叶斯优化的数值能力，实现了强化学习奖励设计的高质量、高效率，为AI自动化奖励设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过设计基于知识图谱的语义通信网络，实现了高效的零样本分类解决方案，在动态或资源受限环境下具备较强适应性。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种处理概念漂移的全局框架，并通过AMR方法在减少数据标注和计算成本的情况下实现高效的连续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续学习方法忽略了真实世界数据流中概念漂移的动态性，难以适应任务分布的变化。

Method: 提出了一种名为Adaptive Memory Realignment（AMR）的轻量级方法，通过选择性剔除缓冲区中过时样本并补充最新样本，调整记忆与新分布对齐。

Result: 实验表明，AMR在多个数据集上的表现可匹敌从头训练，同时大幅减少标注数据和计算成本。

Conclusion: AMR是一个稳定性和适应性兼备的可扩展解决方案，适用于非平稳的连续学习环境。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

### [168] [DeltaSHAP: Explaining Prediction Evolutions in Online Patient Monitoring with Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02342)
*Changhun Kim,Yechan Mun,Sangchul Hahn,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeltaSHAP是一种专为线上患者监控系统设计的新型XAI算法，通过在时间序列中调整Shapley值，从而实现对连续预测变化的实时解释，并在MIMIC-III基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的XAI方法难以满足临床时间序列解释的独特需求，例如对连续预测变化进行解释、提供特征归因的方向与幅度，以及实时提供这些信息。

Method: 通过将Shapley值适配为时间序列场景，DeltaSHAP能够准确捕获特征的联合效应，仅使用实际观察到的特征组合进行预测变化归因。此外，开发了新的评估指标以检验归因的忠实性。

Result: 实验表明，DeltaSHAP在质量上优于现有方法（优越62%），计算效率提高33%。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP在在线患者监控任务中展示了优越性能，对临床应用具有重要意义，并提供了开源代码供研究者进一步探索。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code
at https://github.com/AITRICS/DeltaSHAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，进一步提高算法的泛化能力以应对固定数据集的限制。

Method: 提出Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI)，通过添加并惩罚噪声动作，改进离线强化学习算法的表现。

Result: PANI方法在多种基准测试中表现出显著的性能提升，同时兼容现有多数算法。

Conclusion: PANI是一种简单但高效的方法，为离线强化学习提供了新的潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Conclusion: 整体方案结合了时空策略，提出了新的FGL框架S2FGL，克服了现有方法的缺点，提升了全局GNN的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold定理的InfinityKAN模型，通过自适应学习无限数量的基函数改进了传统的Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KANs需要人为选择基函数数量，限制了其实用性和推广性，因此作者试图通过自适应学习解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将问题建模为变分推理优化问题，结合反向传播，使模型在训练中自适应学习每个单变量函数的基函数数量。

Result: 提出的InfinityKAN模型成功扩展了KANs的可应用性，将重要的超参数纳入学习过程。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN通过变分推理和自适应学习解决了KANs中基函数选择的问题，在理论上和实际应用中提升了模型的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Conclusion: 论文阐明了交换输入和任意输入环境之间的性能差距，并展示了一种能够在这两种情况下取得近最优表现的算法。这项研究对保角预测在在线模式下的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLMs在持续微调时高效性和表达能力的权衡问题，尤其是现有低秩适配方法限制模型学习新任务和知识传递的能力。

Method: 提出了GORP方法，通过结合全秩和低秩参数，并在统一的低秩梯度子空间中进行联合更新，扩大优化空间，同时保持效率并减轻遗忘问题。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准上的实验结果表明，GORP比现有最先进的方法具有更优越的表现。

Conclusion: GORP训练策略在平衡效率与模型表达能力及减少遗忘问题上提供了新的解决方案，并证明其在持续学习场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在线部署中，由于目标模型与起草模型不兼容以及延迟性能的高要求，限制了现有推测解码方法的应用范围，亟需一个通用的解决方案。

Method: 利用在线n-gram缓存结合混合蒸馏微调解决了起草与目标模型之间词汇表不匹配的问题，并通过自适应起草技术提高了解码速度，形成了OmniDraft框架。

Result: OmniDraft在数学推理、编码和文本生成任务中表现优秀，实现了单个Llama-68M模型与多种目标模型的兼容，同时提供了1.5-2倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: OmniDraft展示了一种“通用起草器”的新范式，适合设备端LLM应用，在成本、效率和用户定制性间取得了平衡，为推测解码技术提供了更广泛的部署可能性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

<details>

Motivation: 当前文本到SQL的任务中缺少针对SQL生成的模型研究，同时自我修正生成策略的潜力尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白并提升文本到SQL模型性能。

Method: 引入了RetrySQL方法，针对参考SQL查询准备推理步骤，并通过引入错误与修正步骤的数据进行连续预训练，同时对比全参数预训练与监督微调（LoRA）方式的效果。

Result: 实验表明，RetrySQL方法相较于不使用试错数据预训练的模型，在准确性指标上提升了约4个百分点，并通过自我修正学习提升了下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: RetrySQL展示了自我修正策略在文本到SQL任务中的有效性，为提升SQL生成模型的准确性提供了新方法，并证明其在准确性上可媲美参数量显著更大的专有模型。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Result: 相比基于专家示范的方法，ExPO在复杂任务如MATH等表现出更高的学习效率和最终性能。

Conclusion: ExPO通过解决RL训练初期正样本稀缺问题，有效提升了模型的推理能力，可以取代传统的专家示范方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Conclusion: 研究目标函数的组成稀疏性对深化人工智能的理论基础具有重要意义。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了移除GPT-2模型中的层归一化（LN）后对性能和可解释性产生的影响，并证明LN对于语言建模的重要性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前层归一化（LN）在大语言模型中起稳定训练的作用已有广泛了解，但其在推断阶段的作用尚不明确。此外，LN引入的非线性和组件间的连接性增加了对模型机械可解释性的阻碍。

Method: 通过对各类GPT-2模型移除层归一化（LN），并在验证数据集上测量损失增量，同时研究LN-free模型的性能。研究中还测试了LN-free模型的解释性技术效果。

Result: 在移除了GPT-2中的所有层归一化（LN）后，仅引入了极小的验证损失增长（例如GPT-2 XL的交叉熵损失仅增加+0.03）。发现所需的微调数据量随模型参数增长呈亚线性关系。此外，解释性实验表明LN-free模型中‘信心神经元’非活跃，且直接logit归因技术提供了更精确的直接效应。

Conclusion: 论文表明，LN在语言建模中的作用有限，GPT-2类模型无需LN即可正常运作。LN-free版本的GPT-2家族模型有助于更精确的解释性研究，并进一步加深对语言模型的理解。

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Result: 可实现高效模型大小压缩，同时保留或提升性能表现，并获得优异的压缩-精度平衡。

Conclusion: 改进后的DBNs具有更强的扩展和压缩能力，能够在资源受限的硬件上更高效地进行推理。

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过研究PadéNets模型，解决对比传统方法时的诊断改进可能性，以改进感应电机的故障监测和分析能力。提出的问题是：PadéNets是否在电气和机械故障诊断中优于CNN和Self-ONNs？

Method: 通过对一维CNN、Self-ONN和PadéNets模型的性能测试和比较研究，利用公用的渥太华大学感应电机振动与声学传感器数据集进行实验，分析各模型在不同传感器数据下的诊断性能。

Conclusion: PadéNets凭借其增强的非线性能力及与无界激活函数的兼容性，在感应电机的状态监测中显著提高了故障诊断性能，在相关领域具有重要的研究意义。

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

Conclusion: 潜空间扩散模型适用于动态系统仿真，具有较好压缩性能和预测多样性，提出的设计建议有助于模型优化。

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为Learnable VAE（L-VAE）的新模型，用于同时学习解耦表示和损失函数的超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决\b{eta}-VAE中超参数需手动调整的问题，改进解耦和重建之间的动态权衡能力。

Method: 通过增加正则化项，同时学习损失项的权重及模型的架构参数，从而控制解耦和重建之间的平衡。

Result: 实验表明L-VAE在诸多指标和数据集上表现优于其他模型，尤其在解耦潜在空间维度方面效果显著。

Conclusion: L-VAE在解耦表示学习和重建保真度方面提供了有效的平衡，同时在多种数据集和任务上表现稳定优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的矩阵变分自编码器(matVAE)，在蛋白质突变效果预测任务中表现优异，尤其是在与DMS数据的结合上，展现了替代MSAs的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的蛋白质变体效果预测依赖于MSAs，但这种方法在低进化压力的药物基因中存在局限性，DMS数据集提供了新的机会。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的matVAE模型，结合DMS数据，并引入AlphaFold生成的结构信息进行性能评估与比较。

Result: matVAE-MSA模型在无监督预测任务中超越了DeepSequence，并且计算需求更低。在监督预测中，基于DMS训练的模型表现更佳，引入AlphaFold结构后进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: DMS数据具备替代MSAs的潜力，模型结果对变体效果预测具有指引意义，未来需进一步开发DMS数据集和探索其关系以优化预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 电子健康记录（EHRs）在流行病学研究和人工智能训练中的使用越来越多，但其数据质量问题影响结果可靠性。本文提出了一种适用于研究数据质量评估的新方法——医学数据啄食法，采用生成的自动化数据测试来发现数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR数据被日益用于研究和AI应用，但数据质量问题如偏差和系统性错误会影响研究与结果的可信性。现有方法无法系统性评估数据的研究适用性，存在明显不足。

Method: 提出医学数据啄食法（MDPT），结合软件工程中的单元测试及覆盖率概念，设计出数据质量问题的识别框架。该框架包括：1）利用大语言模型和上下文结合技术的自动测试生成器；2）执行测试并报告错误与覆盖率的数据测试框架。

Result: 在三类数据集（All of Us，MIMIC-III，SyntheticMass）上验证MDPT，每类数据集生成55-73个测试，识别出20-43个数据不对齐或不符合标准的问题，并详细分析了自动生成测试的表现。

Conclusion: 这一方法结合外部医学知识进行上下文相关的数据质量检测，改进分析结果有效性，并为包括引入新数据模态及改进技术在内的后续发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的分层深度学习框架，用于递归高阶元学习，使神经网络能够跨层级任务进行构建、解决和泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习严重依赖人工生成的数据，泛化能力不足；急需一种能够自主生成任务并促使泛化学习的框架。

Method: 利用生成机制创建虚拟任务，并通过元学习器主动探索复杂任务，逐级针对低阶学习器的难题优化约束区域；采用范畴论解释框架以实现结构化与知识迁移。

Result: 该框架实现了从数据生成任务集到学习对现有学习方法的统一，促进了任务的抽象化学习和泛化能力的提升。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法不仅改进了人工干预依赖的问题，还奠定了通用人工智能实现的架构基础。

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 解决当前强化学习中数据效率低的问题，特别是通过信息论方法来优化探索过程。

Method: 提出了将贝叶斯方法融入模型预测和信息论激励的框架PTS-BE，并采用深高斯过程、深核网络和深度集成等方法实现可行的近似计算。

Result: 实验表明，PTS-BE方法在稀疏奖励及纯探索环境中表现出众，优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，该方法有效提升了探索效率，为相关研究提供了坚实的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测方法难以同时兼顾对未知操作的泛化以及在人群群体间的公平性，这两个目标通常被认为是有冲突的。

Method: 本文通过基于后门调整的因果分析揭示公平与泛化之间的联系，提出了名为DAID的框架，该框架包含两个核心模块：1)通过逆概率加权和特征归一化进行人口统计相关的数据重平衡；2)使用对齐损失来抑制对敏感属性的依赖，实现人口统计无关的特征聚合。

Result: 在三个跨域基准测试中，DAID框架在公平性和泛化性方面均显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: DAID框架验证了其理论基础和实践效果，为深度伪造检测模型提供了一种可同时优化公平性与泛化性能的方案。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: 结合同步测序与高通量开发性测试，为满足结合能力及生物物理标准的抗体设计提供了迭代的机器学习驱动流程。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

Motivation: 解决深度学习在医疗影像分析中因数据稀缺、隐私限制以及联邦学习高通信成本和任务单一的问题。

Method: 利用基础模型提取嵌入特征，并通过差分隐私条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE）实现去中心化的隐私感知数据分布建模，同时支持多种下游任务。

Result: 验证了DP-CVAE在多个特征提取器上的隐私性、可扩展性和效率均得到了提升，并优于传统联邦学习分类器，同时生成的嵌入质量超过DP-CGAN，并显著减少参数量。

Conclusion: 提出了一种能够实现隐私保护、高效且支持多任务的数据学习模型，为医疗影像分析提供了更具灵活性和实用性的方法，同时提升了性能和隐私安全性。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ERP系统多为静态、基于规则的方法，通常忽略市场行为者之间的战略性交互，本文旨在弥补此研究缺口。

Method: 评估三种MARL算法（MADDPG、MADQN、QMIX）与静态规则基准在一个基于真实电商交易数据模拟环境中的表现。

Result: 静态规则代理在公平性和价格稳定性方面表现最佳，而MARL算法中MADQN呈现出更激进的定价行为，MADDPG在竞争性和公平性之间取得平衡并具有较高的价格稳定性。

Conclusion: MARL引入了静态定价规则无法捕获的战略性行为，可为未来动态定价策略的发展提供参考。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Result: 粘性保留民主在相同假设下优于传统1p1v方法，并通过FedVRD算法有效限制了对手的影响，提高传输效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够动态优化联邦学习的性能，减少无效参与，同时增强对抗能力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法经常过拟合早期经验（初始偏差问题），这限制了样本效率和模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoG通过模拟神经科学中的遗忘与成长过程，改善了深度强化学习的方法，并在样本效率和任务成绩上实现了显著优势。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HIPPO框架，利用层次对比学习预测蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用(PPI)，提供跨物种的可靠预测和功能推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过对比学习链接异构生物数据模态，并预测在缺乏实验数据的情况下的蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用。

Method: 设计了层次对比框架HIPPO，包含层次对比损失函数和数据驱动的惩罚机制，以匹配蛋白质序列及其层次属性，并结合领域和家族知识。

Result: HIPPO实验结果优于现有方法，在低数据环境下表现出鲁棒性，且能够实现跨物种零样本迁移应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏或不平衡的多物种数据场景中，为PPI预测提供统一框架并进一步推进跨物种预测研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种以超立方体有限搜索和基于熵的优化为基础的新分类方法，既可处理线性又可处理非线性分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨分类问题中基于超平面分离的更高效和灵活的解决策略，以改进传统方法的不足。

Method: 通过在以原点为中心的有限N维超立方体中进行参数搜索，并最小化一基于熵的函数，获得分离向量与非负向量的组合。同时扩展到多项式分类面。

Result: 实验验证了算法在处理多种分类任务，包括线性和非线性可分问题时的高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统优化技术（如支持向量机与梯度下降）提供了稳健的替代方案，适用范围更广。

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: 论文探讨如何改进现代大型语言模型的架构以提高数据 token 使用效率，并提出一种新型的 2-simplicial Transformer 方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现代语言模型依赖于大规模数据集，传统假设的计算受限条件不再适用于高效标注有限数据的实际需求，因此需要设计更高效的数据利用架构。

Method: 引入 2-simplicial Transformer，这是一种通过三线性函数推广标准点积 attention 的架构，利用 Triton 内核实现了高效计算。

Result: 与标准 Transformer 相比，2-simplicial Transformer 在数学、编码、推理和逻辑任务上展现出更好的 token 使用效率，模型的扩展性在知识和推理任务中也有显著提升。

Conclusion: 2-simplicial Transformer 提供了一种有效方式，通过重塑 attention 机制优化了数据使用效率，为有限数据场景下的语言模型提供了更优选择。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Conclusion: 研究为情境在线定价问题提供了严谨的理论指导，具有实际意义，并拓展到其他线性问题场景。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

Motivation: 递归模型本质上可以处理任意长度的序列，但通常在超出训练上下文长度后性能显著下降，因此需要探讨其长度泛化的原因与解决办法。

Method: 通过理论与实验分析，提出了未探测状态假设，开发了如用高斯噪声初始化状态或使用其他序列的终态作为初态等简单的训练干预方法。

Result: 通过仅500步的后期训练，这些干预方法显著增强了递归模型的长度泛化能力，使其可处理远超训练上下文长度的序列，并在长上下文任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 简单的训练干预方法可以显著改善递归模型的长度泛化能力，为解决超长序列处理问题提供了高效可行的方案。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Motivation: 目前生存分析模型仅在群体层面上进行校准，可能对少数群体校准较差。作者试图解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将多校准问题建模为一个受约束的优化问题，GRADUATE结合校准和判别能力进行优化，并提供数学证明以验证方法的有效性。

Result: 实验表明GRADUATE在真实临床数据集上优于现有的最新方法。

Conclusion: GRADUATE成功提升了模型在整体和少数群体中的校准能力，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the

for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

Conclusion: 新框架解决了推断阶段文本信息引起的偏差问题，为个性化医学决策提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is

Conclusion: 新框架在动态调度问题上验证了其有效性，同时提出了改进学习过程和扩展QD算法应用范围的潜力研究方向。

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

Conclusion: 本研究补充了MOEAs在数值优化中的理论研究，并提出可操作性强的实验方法，为实际应用提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

Result: 多增益模型为 $(\mu+\lambda)$ EA 提供了更紧确的时间复杂度上界，包括：对相关权值的背包问题，两项更紧的时间复杂度上界；对一般化的 $k$-MAX-SAT 问题提供了时间复杂度的闭式上界表达；对旅行商问题提出了更紧确的时间复杂度上界。实验结果显示，实际运算时间与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 多增益模型是分析 $(\mu+\lambda)$ EA 对组合优化问题运行时间的一种有效工具，改进了理论模型，且实验结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.
