### [1] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何在没有真实训练数据的情况下实现可靠的水下3D目标检测，并提出了一种结合基于物理的声呐模拟和模板匹配系统的双轨范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D目标检测面临声音环境恶劣和训练数据稀缺的挑战，传统和深度学习方法均难应对。

Method: 开发了基于物理的声呐仿真生成合成数据用于神经网络训练，并设计了基于目标几何先验的模板匹配系统。

Result: 神经网络在合成数据上取得98%的mAP，但在真实数据上下降到40%，而模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83%的mAP，无需训练。

Conclusion: 证明了在数据稀缺环境下无需数据饥渴的深度学习也可以实现高性能检测，开启了水下领域基准测试和应用的新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MobileDenseAttn的深度学习模型，通过结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201，提升了脑部肿瘤MRI检测的效率和解释性，取得了高准确率和稳定结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的脑瘤MRI检测方法具有通用性差、计算效率低、不可解释性和透明性问题，影响了诊断效果和信任度。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流架构并进行特征级别融合，使用GradCAM热图进行可视化解释，在包含不同肿瘤的扩展MRI数据集上进行训练和验证。

Result: 模型在5折交叉验证下达到训练准确率99.75%、测试准确率98.35%、F1值0.9835，并相比VGG19减少了39.3%的训练时间，准确率提高了3.67%。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn在脑瘤检测中表现出高效率、高性能和良好的解释性，有望成为实际临床应用工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现在基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）中，当提到实体的视觉参考时，其回忆事实关联的能力大幅下降。然而，通过探针可以精确识别这些模型可靠性的问题情境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在多模态信息（视觉和文本）融合中是否具有系统性不足特别是视觉参考的影响。

Method: 通过实验研究VLMs对视觉和文本关联事实的不同表现，并引入探针方法来检测模型的多模态理解中潜在错误。

Result: 探针检测模型不可靠情况的准确率超过92%，可在视觉问答任务中提升7.87%的覆盖率，同时降低0.9%的错误率。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉参考的信息整合方面存在不足，但这种问题是可被系统化识别的，为强化语言对视觉的绑定提供了未来研究方向的依据。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种语义感知的神经重建方法，可从稀疏图像生成高保真三维模型，有效缓解形状和辐射模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对稀疏图像特征匹配不准确导致的辐射模糊问题，需提升神经隐式表示的表达能力。

Method: 通过添加语义logits以增强隐式表示，与符号距离场和辐射场优化结合，并结合几何原始遮罩进行正则化处理以缓解形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上的重建性能显著提升，相较于SparseNeuS提升44%，相较于VolRecon提升20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo插件，平均误差降低69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了稀疏图像的3D重建精度，尤其在形状和辐射模糊问题上的处理取得了显著成果。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 非法垃圾填埋场威胁全球健康和环境，深度学习可助力快速识别此类地点。研究使用AerialWaste数据集及轻量级深度学习模型达成92%以上分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场因手动识别困难往往被忽视，从而对人类和自然构成严重威胁。研究旨在通过深度学习高效解决此问题。

Method: 研究基于AerialWaste数据集，测试并对比多种轻量级深度学习模型（如Mobilenetv2、Googlenet等），最终结合模型并采纳集成技术。

Result: 利用集成模型对数据集进行二分类，取得92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%敏感性、92.41% F1分数及92.71%特异性。

Conclusion: 轻量级深度学习模型结合集成技术能有效解决非法垃圾填埋场检测问题，表现优异，为环境管理提供科学支持。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态情感分析框架SSU，动态构建模态特定的结构图并通过语义锚点实现跨模态语义对齐，达到了更好的情感分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态融合方法通常忽视了模态特定的结构依赖和语义错位，限制了算法的准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了SSU框架，利用文本的语言语法动态构建模态特定图，并通过基于文本的轻量级注意力机制对音频和视觉模态进行处理。同时引入语义锚点作为跨模态对齐的核心，并采用多视角对比学习目标以提升区分性和语义一致性。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI两个基准数据集上，SSU取得了最先进的性能，同时显著降低了计算开销。

Conclusion: SSU框架不仅提高了多模态情感分析的准确性，还具有较好的可解释性，能够通过语义交互捕捉细腻的情感模式。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一种快速、高效的3D面部建模框架，可从任意角度单张图像创建3D高斯点模型，并在10毫秒内完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的3D面部生成方法在速度与质量上存在局限，FastAvatar致力于实现高质量和实时性兼顾。

Method: 本研究使用新型编码-解码神经网络设计，从训练数据中构建面部3D高斯点模板模型，对输入图像编码生成身份特异且姿势不变的嵌入表征，最终通过预测高斯模板参数剩余值实现快速推断。

Result: FastAvatar在面部重建质量上显著优于其他前馈方法，速度比优化方法快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑功能。

Conclusion: FastAvatar实现高质量、快速的3D面部建模，为消费者和交互系统扩展了3D高斯点建模的应用范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种移动生物识别系统，使用PolyProtect方法处理生物模板保护问题，重点在于提高效率的同时保障隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人道主义和紧急场景中，生物识别技术可显著提高操作效率，但存在数据隐私风险亟需解决。

Method: 本文使用PolyProtect方法处理人脸与指纹的生物模板保护，采用EdgeFace进行特征提取，并在埃塞俄比亚人道主义项目中的真实数据上进行测试与扩展。

Result: 实验表明，PolyProtect在准确性、不可逆性及数据不可关联性等方面表现优异，并在指纹识别上首次取得良好评价。

Conclusion: PolyProtect方法在提供生物识别保护的同时具备高效性与通用性，适合应用于脆弱环境中的人道主义场景。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了视觉基础模型（FMs）的局限性，并提出通过动态关系图增强其关系推理能力，以解决细粒度图像和视频理解任务中的挑战，同时提高性能、效率和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉基础模型在实体关系、空间和时间推理任务中表现出持续的局限性，这在复杂人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解及医学图像分析等领域尤其显著。

Method: 提出整合动态关系图的方式，用轻量级、上下文适应的图推理模块对现有 FMs 进行增强，这些图的拓扑和边的语义由输入数据和任务上下文推断。

Result: 改进后的模型在细粒度语义保真度、跨分布鲁棒性、可解释性以及计算效率方面优于仅使用 FMs 的基线模型。此外，这种方法还能提升内存和硬件效率，适合实际资源限制下的部署。

Conclusion: 建议进一步研究动态图构建、分层关系推理、跨模态融合及面向关系能力的评估方案，以发展下一代具备强关系推理能力的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于车牌可读性分类的新数据集（LPLC），并基于此进行了基准测试，展现了任务的复杂性以及后续研究的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于车牌识别在处理难以辨认的车牌时存在困难，而现有技术在图像增强（如超分辨率）方面存在局限性，因此需要一种针对性数据处理的方法来提升模型性能和效率。

Method: 引入了一个包含10,210张车辆图片及12,687个经过详细注释的车牌数据集LPLC，包括可读性分类（四类）及相关的标签信息，并使用三种图像识别网络（ViT, ResNet, YOLO）进行基准测试研究。

Result: 所有基准模型在分类任务上的F1分数均低于80%，研究也揭示了任务的难度以及现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的LPLC数据集填补了相关领域的研究空白，数据集及研究表明车牌可读性分类与识别仍有很大提升空间，鼓励进一步的研究探索。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

TL;DR: CLARIFY系统结合了一个轻量级的领域训练模型(Specialist)和一个压缩后的通用对话模型(Generalist)，显著改善了皮肤科视觉问答任务的诊断准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用视觉语言模型(VLMs)在医学任务中表现潜力巨大，但面临专业诊断准确性不足和超高推理成本的问题，限制了其在实际临床中的部署。

Method: 提出CLARIFY框架，通过一个经过领域训练的轻量级图像分类器(Specialist)提供快速精准的诊断，同时利用压缩后的通用对话VLM(Generalist)生成自然语言解释，并结合知识图谱模块加强模型的可靠性和准确性。

Result: 在一个多模态皮肤病数据集上的实验表明，CLARIFY在诊断精度上比最强基线提高了18%，同时显著降低了显存需求(至少20%)和推理延迟(至少5%)。

Conclusion: CLARIFY系统证明了Specialist-Generalist框架能有效构建轻量、高可信度且临床实用的AI系统，适用于医学诊断场景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Result: 该系统成功结合了预测建模及视觉-语言理解，能够在复杂环境中检测未见过的行为，对零样本异常检测中的时间推理与语义上下文间的差距进行有效弥合。

Conclusion: 这种框架为解决监控异常检测问题提供了一种创新且通用的方法，其开发的代码已公开，供业界参考使用。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

TL;DR: 自监督方法DoGFlow利用雷达Doppler测量生成伪标签并传递到LiDAR领域，实现高效3D场景流估计，无需人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前3D场景流估计中自监督方法性能不足，及全监督方法依赖昂贵人工标注的问题。

Method: 提出了一个跨模态标签转移框架DoGFlow，通过雷达Doppler测量生成运动伪标签，并通过动态感知的关联与传播将其转移到LiDAR领域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上，DoGFlow显著优于现有自监督方法，并且使得只需10%的标注数据即可达到全监督性能的90%。

Conclusion: DoGFlow展示了无需手动标注即可实现高效自监督3D场景流估计的潜力，为动态环境中的自主系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为SatSkylines的3D建筑生成方法，结合了卫星图像和粗糙的几何先验，大幅提升了建筑形状的恢复精度，同时开发了一个包含超过5万建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法在恢复卫星图像中的建筑结构时面临精度问题，而依赖高细节输入的3D细化方法无法从简单几何先验生成满意结果。该研究旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过建模从插值后的噪声粗糙几何到详细几何的变换过程，并结合高效的几何控制，同时构建了Skylines-50K大规模3D建筑数据集以支持生成详细建筑模型。

Result: 实验表明SatSkylines模型具有较强的效果和泛化能力，能够生成高质量建筑结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了卫星图像生成3D建筑时精度和细节不足的问题，为复杂建筑的高效3D建模提供了一种新的可能性。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在复杂3D游戏环境中，基于视觉线索检测可通行的空间过渡点(STPs)及其主路径过渡点(MSTP)，并通过深度学习方法建立了基准模型和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过自动识别设计预期的关键路径过渡点，提升游戏客户端的自动地图绘制效率，并为地图线索呈现提供评估依据。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习流程：第一阶段利用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STPs，第二阶段通过轻量级选择器融合局部与全局视觉特征对MSTP进行排序，同时引入可选的检索增强融合模块。

Result: 在五款动作角色扮演游戏数据集上实验表明：全网络微调在数据充足时检测性能最佳，但适配器模式在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更为鲁棒与高效。

Conclusion: 此研究提出新问题、基准管线和数据集，同时探索了高效模型适配方法，为未来AI驱动导航辅助工具与数据驱动关卡设计工具奠定基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Conclusion: 该研究为实现电影级音频驱动角色动画提供了创新方法，其更高的表达能力与应用潜力对行业具有重要意义。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有方法中固定融合方案和信息交互不足的问题，设计一种动态、高效的信息融合框架。

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包括随机特征重组策略和区域交叉注意力网络，用于改进特征表达与融合。

Result: 在内部肝癌数据和TCGA公共数据集上的实验结果显示，DeReF框架表现优越。

Conclusion: DeReF通过改进特征融合方式，显著提高癌症生存分析的性能，并将在未来发布代码。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频物体移除技术在处理与物体相关的副效应（如阴影、反光等）时存在困难，因缺乏监督的配对视频数据。

Method: 提出ROSE框架，利用3D渲染引擎生成大规模、丰富场景的配对合成数据，并设计了一个基于扩散变压器的视频修补模型，通过差异遮罩预测物体副效应区域。

Result: ROSE在新提出的ROSE-Bench基准测试中，对于普通场景和五种特殊副效应的移除均表现出色，且在真实视频场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ROSE解决了视频物体移除中的副效应问题，结合生成技术和扩散变压器，显著提升了效果，为相关问题提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种解决视频字幕生成中过分侧重运动或细节问题的新方法，包括数据集构建和优化方法；并开发了一个新模型OwlCap，实验表明其在两个基准上性能显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕生成方法存在运动和细节不平衡问题，导致字幕不完整，影响视频理解与生成的一致性。

Method: 从数据和优化两个方面入手：构建包含运动-细节融合的HMD-270K数据集；提出基于GRPO的奖励机制CSER，通过单位到集合匹配与双向验证，提高对运动和细节的捕获能力。

Result: 基于HMD-270K数据集的监督微调和CSER的优化后训练，OwlCap在VDC (+4.2 Acc)和DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1)基准上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过解决运动和细节平衡问题，所提出的方法及模型在视频字幕生成领域具有重要贡献，将为社区研究提供资源与借鉴。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFormer的模型，通过频域的信噪比 (SNR) 先验和傅里叶注意力机制提升水下图像增强的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的水下图像增强方法虽然结合了SNR先验，但存在无法有效分离跨通道干扰和放大结构信息的局限性，亟需改进。

Method: 以频域SNR先验为核心，通过傅里叶注意力SNR Transformer(FAST)和频域自适应Transformer(FAT)模块，结合U型架构与传统RGB流，构建了SFormer模型。

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的测评中，SFormer在PSNR上提升了3.1 dB，SSIM上提升了0.08，显著改善水下图像的颜色、纹理和对比度。

Conclusion: SFormer成功整合频域SNR先验和Transformer机制，超越了现有水下图像增强方法，显现出突出的增强能力。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有研究尽管在分割性能上表现良好，但在射血分数（EF）估计上效果不佳，激发了改进方法的需求。

Method: 采用分层设计，低级阶段使用卷积神经网络对单帧图像进行处理，高级阶段利用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系，同时通过时空跨扫描模块（STCS）扩展长远背景信息。

Result: 平衡了单帧与多帧的处理，减轻了仅依赖单一模式时的局部误差累积或细节忽略问题，同时降低了超声图像噪声对EF计算的偏差影响。

Conclusion: 分层时空分割网络和STCS模块的结合提升了心脏超声视频分析的射血分数估计的准确性。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了一个名为FPS（Feature-space Planes Searcher）的新域适应框架，解决了模型在跨域操作中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的非监督域适应方法（UDA）通常依赖于微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差、对现代架构扩展性差等问题。

Method: 研究发现，大规模数据预训练的模型在特征空间中表现出域不变的几何模式，于是提出了FPS框架，通过优化决策边界并保持特征编码器冻结，来解决边界未对齐问题。

Result: FPS在公开基准数据集上的表现与最先进的方法持平或更好，且具有高效的扩展性，可用于蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多种领域。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一种简单、高效、可泛化的迁移学习范式，尤其对域适应任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Result: 在UCF-YouTube数据集上取得99.65%的识别准确率，特征数量减少至7个，同时提高了推理时间性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的轻量化、可扩展框架支持实时部署于边缘设备，为智能且资源感知的环境提供了高效的HAR解决方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Motivation: 当前方法难以捕捉细微的颜色变化和建模全局形变，例如3DGS中固定每高斯的颜色分配和线性形变无法胜任复杂纹理及一致的全局形变建模。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives，利用动态锚点和可学习的颜色参数编码空间变化的纹理，并设计增强形变模型（EDM），结合时间感知高斯基函数与时间无关的可学习形变参数，精准建模局部和全局运动。

Conclusion: ColorGS在平衡高保真度与计算实用性上取得突破，适用于手术场景重建，助力术中导航以及AR/VR应用。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为类级洪水正则化的技术，用于改进在不平衡数据集上神经网络的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在处理不平衡数据时，模型往往对多数类有更好的预测性能，但少数类的性能显著下降。需要一种方法来减轻这种不平衡的影响，同时保持模型的整体泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种类级洪水正则化方法，通过为每个类分配与其频率相关的类特定洪水阈值，防止多数类过拟合并为少数类提供足够的学习。

Result: 实验显示，与传统洪水正则化相比，所提方法显著提高了少数类的分类性能，并增强了整体泛化性能。

Conclusion: 类级洪水正则化能有效缓解不平衡数据的影响，提高少数类的识别率，同时改善模型的整体表现。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合课程学习（CL）与锐度感知最小化（SAM）的新方法，并通过引入对抗难度测量（ADM）来提高泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决神经网络因经验风险最小化导致的过拟合问题，基于课程学习和锐度感知最小化的结合可以同时改进鲁棒性和泛化性能，但二者的结合并不简单。

Method: 提出对抗难度测量（ADM），通过量化模型对对抗样本的脆弱性来动态评估样本难度，将其集成到基于课程学习和SAM的训练中。

Result: 在图像分类任务、细粒度识别以及领域泛化中，实验表明所提方法既保留了CL和SAM各自的优点，还优于现有的基于课程学习和锐度感知的训练方法。

Conclusion: 通过设计基于ADM的动态难度评估方法，成功地将课程学习与锐度感知最小化相结合，从而同时提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

### [29] [Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729)
*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了水下目标检测中某些物种检测效果不佳的原因及改进方法，发现问题主要在前景背景分割阶段，与数据数量无关。建议在精确率和召回率间根据需求选择分布并改进算法，特别是定位模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测对海洋生态系统监控至关重要，但面临图像质量下降、类别分布不平衡以及视觉特性差异等挑战。现有检测方法对不同物种的识别效果差异显著，但其原因尚不明确。

Method: 通过操控DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分为定位和分类两部分，分析低性能类别（如扇贝）的表现。使用YOLO和TIDE工具评估定位性能，并实验平衡数据下分类精确度差异以探索潜在原因。

Result: 定位分析发现前景与背景的区分是主要问题，与数据量无关；分类实验揭示了即使在数据平衡的情况下也存在固有特征问题。总结可优先采用不平衡分布提升精确率，或平衡分布提升召回率。

Conclusion: 对检测表现欠佳的类别改进应重点专注算法革新，特别是定位模块部分。作者公开了代码和数据以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法多从点云、网格或文本生成实体模型，但忽略了从2D工程图生成参数化CAD模型这一关键工业需求。

Method: 设计Drawing2CAD框架，包含新型向量表示、双解码器Transformer架构及软目标分布损失函数，同时构建CAD-VGDrawing数据集以评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，Drawing2CAD方法能够有效生成参数化CAD模型并保留几何精度和设计意图。

Conclusion: Drawing2CAD在参数化CAD模型生成方面表现优秀，为2D到3D工业设计转换提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: 目前在嘈杂环境下的音视频语音识别系统在音频可靠性评估及动态调整不同模态依赖性方面存在不足。

Method: 通过一种结合音视频特征融合的路由器方法，根据音频质量对特征权重进行动态调整，利用跨注意力机制增强视觉特征，降低不可靠音频的权重。

Result: 在LRS3数据集上，与AV-HuBERT相比，相对单词错误率降低16.51%-42.67%。

Conclusion: 验证了所提路由器及门组件在真实声学噪声下改进鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

### [32] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新基准，改进了现有的人工物体交互(HOI)检测评估方法，重新定义问题为多答案选择任务，以更好地适应生成式视觉语言模型(VLM)和专用HOI方法的评估需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HOI评测标准与现代生成式VLM不匹配，且容易因模糊情况下的多个合理预测被惩罚。而最新的生成式VLM具备对HOI场景较强的理解能力，有必要设计更适合的评测基准，探索其性能。

Method: 引入一个新基准，将HOI检测重新设计为多答案的多选任务，选项包括真实的正向例和经过筛选的负向例，降低歧义对评分的影响，评估既适用于VLM也适用于传统HOI方法。

Result: 新提出的评估协议允许对VLM和HOI方法进行直接比较，消除了对合理预测的惩罚，从而揭示了这些方法在HOI理解上的发展现状。

Conclusion: 新基准和协议为现代生成式VLM与传统HOI方法之间的性能比较提供了公平的平台，并能更好地捕捉它们在HOI场景上的能力差异。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS)，用以生成包含视觉选项的教育多选题，实验表明其在内容区分、问题生成及视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要聚焦于生成带有文本选项的多选题，却忽视了视觉选项的生成，同时高质量干扰选项的生成也面临着极高的成本和有限的可扩展性。

Method: 提出了一个跨模态选项生成框架CmOS，该框架结合了多模态思维链推理（MCoT）过程和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，以生成语义上合理且视觉上相似的答案和干扰选项，并通过一个判别模块筛选适合的视觉选项内容。

Result: 实验表明，CmOS在内容区分、问题生成和视觉选项生成的效果超越了现有的方法，适用于多种学科和教育水平。

Conclusion: 本文提出的CmOS框架在多项指标上证明了其生成高质量视觉多选题的能力，为教育领域的题目生成提供了新机制。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer突破了对高成本真值地图的依赖，为在线地图模型的广泛普适性和半监督预训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 利用印象标签与字体形状的关联关系，该方法提供了一种优于传统嵌入方法的方式，为基于印象的字体应用贡献了新的路径。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微外科吻合需要高超的技巧和空间把控能力，但目前的评估方法存在依赖主观判断的问题，可能导致评估效率和可靠性降低。

Method: 作者通过引入图像处理技术和几何建模，并结合检测与评分机制，设计了一种量化的客观评估框架，基于来自医院的三个数据集测试。

Result: 结果表明，几何度量在所考虑的误差方面能够有效模拟专家评分。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了显微外科技能评估的效率和可靠性，并为训练改进提供了量化支撑。

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速适配于每段视频的像素级合成视频稳定方法，通过在测试时利用低级视觉线索，提高稳定性和视觉质量，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全帧视频合成方法难以因应视频序列中多样化运动特性与视觉内容，需解决泛化性问题。

Method: 利用低级视觉线索，在测试时快速调整模型参数，并结合震颤定位模块和针对性适配策略，专注处理高震颤区域，从而提升稳定性及减少适配步骤。

Result: 方法能够显著提升现有像素级合成稳定方法的性能，实验在多样化真实数据集上证实了其优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持全帧方法优点的基础上，超越了传统的SOTA方法，还提供了与经典方法类似的用户控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

TL;DR: 提出DualFairVL，一个多模态提示学习框架，用于实现跨模态的公平诊断和对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗诊断中实现跨人口统计群体的公平性，特别是在成像设备和临床实践导致的分布变化情况下。

Method: 提出DualFairVL框架，采用并行双分支架构分离敏感和目标属性，通过正交文本锚点和超网络生成实例相关视觉提示，进一步进行跨模态表达对齐和公平性增强。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集的实验中，DualFairVL在分布内外测试中实现了公平性和准确性的最新结果，且参数仅为3.6M。

Conclusion: DualFairVL在保证跨模态对齐和公平性能的同时，达成了优异的性能表现，展示了其在医疗诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测中的DETR框架通常使用随机初始化查询，导致了含义不明确的表示，限制了模型的性能。

Method: 引入双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过物体查询增强模块和交互语义融合模块分别优化物体和交互查询，并加入辅助预测单元来提高交互特征的表示能力。

Result: 所提出的方法在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现出竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 通过设计增强查询的网络结构，改善了HOI检测中模型对物体和交互的理解能力，从而提高了检测精度。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析群体与单人行人在空间利用和行为模式上的差异，辅助空间设计和人群动力学研究。

Method: 通过将轨迹分割为固定时间段，使用Transformer分类模型识别群体与单人行人，并引入空间和行为两方面的综合指标体系。

Result: 成功创建了分类管道和数据集框架，为未来更深入的定量分析奠定基础。

Conclusion: 研究为基于帧序列长度的扩展分析创造了条件，未来将用于人群模拟和空间设计验证。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Motivation: 传统地图制作依赖GIS，专业性强且耗时，而生成式AI的进步为其提供了自动化和普及化的机会。

Method: 通过集成向量数据，引导地图生成，并支持基于文本提示生成不同风格的地图，并开发了一个在线应用以增强可用性。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可以帮助非专家和专业人士更高效地创建地图，同时需要进一步技术改进，并重新定义制图师在AI辅助地图制作中的角色。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 解决风格驱动任务与主题驱动任务之间的对立，提出一个统一模型处理两者。

Method: 通过大规模三元数据集构造，采用解耦学习策略，进行风格对齐训练与内容风格解耦训练，并引入风格奖励学习（SRL）。

Result: USO模型在主题一致性和风格相似性维度上超越了开源模型的现有性能。

Conclusion: 提出的USO框架有效统一了风格驱动和主题驱动生成任务，并提升了两种生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了用于视觉定位的NeRF方法的隐私问题，并提出了一种基于分割监督训练的隐私保护NeRF变体(ppNeSF)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在视觉定位中表现出色，但其存储的细节带来隐私泄露风险。作者希望通过研究NeRF隐私问题并提出改进来解决这一挑战。

Method: 作者提出了一种隐私保护协议评估NeRF方法，同时设计了ppNeSF，这是一种通过分割监督而非RGB图像训练的NeRF变体。

Result: 作者发现标准NeRF在几何表示中存储了大量细节，可能会导致隐私攻击，而ppNeSF在隐藏细节的同时，仍能实现准确的视觉定位并达到最新性能。

Conclusion: ppNeSF为在保护隐私的同时进行高性能视觉定位提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: Document VQA涉及大规模文档处理，传统方法高内存需求，需要更高效的方式处理多页文档。

Method: 通过文本和视觉两种检索方式结合RAG生成答案，并在多模型和多数据集上进行系统评估。

Result: 文本版本提升最高+22.5 ANLS，视觉版本无需文本提取亦有+5.0 ANLS提升；检索与重排序组件是主要提升来源。

Conclusion: 精确的证据选择显著提升Document VQA的性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Motivation: 随着VLMs在实际应用中的普及，了解这些模型中的人口偏见变得至关重要，以确保其公平性和准确性。

Method: 开发了一个名为GRAS的基准测试，用于揭示VLMs在人口偏见（性别、种族、年龄和肤色）的多样性方面的问题，并提出GRAS偏见评分这一可解释指标来量化偏见水平。

Result: 对五个先进的VLMs进行了基准测试，发现偏见问题严重，其中偏见最少的模型也仅获得2/100的GRAS偏见评分。

Conclusion: VLMs在偏见问题上仍需大幅改进，特别是在进行视觉问答(VQA)时，需要考虑问题的多种表述方式以更准确地评估偏见。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络通过综合几何约束和变压器架构的创新设计，解决了当前方法存在的三个主要问题，提升了LiDAR点云屋顶平面检测的效果。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

### [56] [MicroDetect-Net (MDN): Leveraging Deep Learning to Detect Microplastics in Clam Blood, a Step Towards Human Blood Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19021)
*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究引入了MicroDetect-Net模型（MDN），利用荧光显微镜和深度学习技术检测微塑料，显示出高达92%的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于塑料污染日益严重，研究微塑料对人类健康的潜在危害愈发重要，因此需要一种高效的微塑料检测方法。

Method: 提出基于荧光显微镜、Nile Red染色和卷积神经网络（CNN）的MDN模型，通过数据集准备、荧光成像和图像分割进行微塑料定位和计数。

Result: 在含276张Nile Red染色荧光血液图像的数据集上，MDN达到了92%的准确性，以及87.4%的IoU、92.1%的F1分数、90.6%的精确率和93.7%的召回率。

Conclusion: MDN模型在用蛤类血液检测微塑料方面表现出色，为未来在人类血液样本中应用与进一步研究提供了可能性。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ProPy的模型，通过改进CLIP架构来解决PRVR问题，并在三个公共数据集上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRVR方法主要专注于处理单模态特征，但忽略了强大的预训练视觉-语言模型CLIP的潜力，因此需要一种新的方法以更好地应用这些模型。

Method: 设计了ProPy模型，主要包括：1）提示金字塔结构，帮助捕捉多层次语义；2）祖先-后代交互机制，增强事件之间的语义交互能力。

Result: ProPy在三个公共数据集上显著超越了之前的模型，达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地改进CLIP架构，ProPy为解决PRVR问题提供了一种高效的新方法，证明了其优越的性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺性是利用机器学习进行医学图像分析中的主要挑战。该研究通过自监督学习和基础模型来解决这一问题，以改善冠状动脉中血流动力学生物标志物的评估。

Method: 研究利用3D血管几何模型生成热核签名作为自监督目标，通过拉普拉斯特征向量提取形状信息，用来辅助小规模临床试验（49名患者）数据集的训练。

Result: 研究发现，通过学习几何表示，可以在受限数据下提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力区域的分割能力（低、中、高剪切应力）。

Conclusion: 将几何学习和自监督方法应用于3D血管数据，可以有效提高小样本医学图像分析的性能，尤其是对冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估具有促进作用。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet显著提高了工业表面缺陷检测的效率和性能，同时兼顾多种监督场景的实际需求，是学术研究与工业应用之间的重要桥梁。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机在固定场景和低运动状态下无事件生成的问题。

Method: 使用旋转不平衡质量形成振动，与运动补偿处理相结合，生成干净的事件数据。

Result: 证明方法可有效恢复运动参数，并提升图像重建和边缘检测性能。

Conclusion: 提供了一种简单高效的解决方案，改善事件相机在低运动场景中的表现。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化历史文档的文本线分割需要大量标注数据，而这一过程费时费力且需要专业知识，因此探索少样本学习成为降低数据需求的重要方向。

Method: 使用轻量级UNet++与连接性感知损失函数相结合，通过只需三页手稿图像的小块数据进行训练，有效减少数据需求并提升分割性能。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上，方法实现了识别准确度提升200%及分割线交并比提升75%的突破，并在DIVA-HisDB检测任务中取得了与竞赛优胜算法相当甚至更高的F值表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法证明了轻量级架构配合拓扑感知损失既高效又准确，能够以极少的数据达到卓越的分割效果。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在处理包含几何信息的文本描述时对数值的单位理解较弱，影响了模型的3D感知能力，因此需要找到提升该能力的方法。

Method: 论文提出了两个主要方法：1）3D文本增强(3DTE)，通过增加文本查询中距离描述的多样性，改进不同单位之间的映射理解；2）文本引导几何增强(TGE)，将文本特征投射到几何一致的空间中，从而更精确地引导几何特征的注意力。

Conclusion: 增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力对于提升单目3D视觉绑定任务的性能至关重要，新方法在准确性上取得了显著的提升，且代码将会公开。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种称为魏尔斯特拉斯椭圆函数位置编码（WEF-PE）的新方法，用于视觉Transformer模型中，能够比传统位置编码方法更有效地保留二维空间信息和几何约束，实验验证其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉Transformer的可学习位置编码缺乏对图像二维空间结构的保留，传统的方法在空间距离与序列编码索引之间不能建立良好的对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出了WEF-PE，通过使用椭圆函数的双周期性质和复杂域表示，有效保留空间距离关系和几何结构。该方法还能通过代数加法公式直接从绝对编码推导任意两patch间的相对位置关系。

Result: 在CIFAR-100从头训练中取得63.78%的准确率，在CIFAR-100微调中达到93.28%的准确率，并在VTAB-1k基准任务中表现出一致改进，同时通过理论分析和可视化验证了其几何归纳偏置和语义聚焦能力。

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过非线性几何特性和数学原理填补了视觉Transformer中位置编码的关键缺陷，既提高了模型对空间结构的感知能力，又验证了其实用性，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

TL;DR: 本文提出的视频头像模型实现了更具语义表达和情感共鸣的动画生成，克服了现有模型仅限于音频节奏同步的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破现有模型难以捕捉人物深层次情感意图和语境的限制，旨在生成语义连贯且富有表现力的角色动画。

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型生成条件的结构化文本表征，提供高层语义引导；2. 提出专门的多模态DiT架构和伪最后一帧设计，融合多模态输入并缓解模式间冲突。

Result: 模型在包括唇同步准确性、视频质量、动作自然度以及与文本提示的语义一致性等全面指标上实现领先性能，还展示出对复杂场景的出色扩展能力。

Conclusion: OmniHuman-1.5在语义一致、动作自然以及复杂场景的表达上树立了新的基准，推动视频头像模型更深层次的表达和语义智能化发展。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为VFTrack的实时粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪扫描电子显微镜(SEM)图像序列中的碳纳米管(CNT)粒子运动特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对于CNT动态生长的表征受限于实验挑战，现有方法无法同时满足实时性和精细的运动轨迹分解需求。

Method: 提出VFTrack框架，通过结合手工或深度学习特征检测器与匹配器，实现对CNT粒子在SEM图像中的自动检测与运动跟踪分析。

Result: 对13,540条手动标注轨迹进行系统性测试，评估出ALIKED检测器和LightGlue匹配器组合在F1分数和$\alpha$分数上表现最佳。

Conclusion: VFTrack提高了自动化纳米材料表征能力，使得物理模型和实验观测间的结合更紧密，并为CNT合成的实时优化提供了可能性。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用视频分割模型AUSM，用于统一处理提示和非提示视频分割任务，并通过并行训练实现加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频分割领域多由任务专属模型主导，无法统一处理提示型与非提示型视频分割任务，需要一个通用模型。

Method: 提出一种自回归通用分割模型（AUSM），基于状态空间模型，使用固定大小的空间状态，实现对任意长度视频流的分割，并通过帧级并行训练加速。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（如DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE等）中，AUSM表现优于现有方法，训练速度可提高至2.5倍。

Conclusion: AUSM为统一视频分割任务提供了一个高效的平台，在性能和训练速度上均优于现有模型。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: 为4D风格化领域提供标准化评估和加速研究进展。

Method: 引入Style4D基准套件，包括评估协议、基线模型（Style4D）和动态4D场景数据集，采用对比一致性学习和结构内容保留的风格转移模块。

Result: Style4D在Style4D-Bench上的实验中表现出色，生成具有细腻风格细节、时空稳定和多视点一致的4D渲染效果。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为标准化4D风格化研究的重要资源，有助于激发该领域的研究和改进。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种纯粹基于语言控制的方法Articulate3D，可以无训练地对3D资产进行姿势调整。通过分两步：图像生成和多视角优化，实现任务目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有了进展，但通过语言控制3D资产姿势仍然是挑战性的问题。

Method: 第一步是利用图像生成器生成目标图像，基于输入图像与文本指令条件，同时引入RSActrl机制；第二步通过多视角姿势优化将网格与目标图对应。

Result: Articulate3D成功在多个3D对象和自由文本提示中调整姿势并保持网格原有的身份。一项用户研究显示85%以上用户更倾向于该方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D是一种有效的无训练3D姿势控制方法，相比现有方法表现更优。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VoxHammer的无训练方法，通过编辑三维潜在空间，实现高精度和一致性的三维局部编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前游戏行业和机器人交互需求中的3D局部编辑方法难以同时保证未编辑区域的保留精度和整体连贯性。

Method: VoxHammer基于结构化3D生成模型进行设计，通过预测3D模型的反演轨迹，并在去噪和编辑阶段利用缓存的潜在信息和关键特征值，实现精确的局部编辑和一致的区域保留。

Result: 实验表明，VoxHammer在未编辑区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法。同时构建的人类标注的Edit3D-Bench数据集验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VoxHammer方法为高质量的3D局部编辑提供了新方案，并为上下文感知的3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

### [75] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于语义吸引子的理论框架，用于构建语义人工通用智能（AGI），不同于基于统计预测的现有语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型主要基于统计预测，无法实现深层语义理解与表达的缺陷。

Method: 通过复数值语义空间的递归张量变换和循环操作，引入一个中心语义吸引子，来引导语义向稳定性和表达深度收敛。

Result: 提出了一种新的语义转换模型，能够处理讽刺、歧义等复杂语义现象。

Conclusion: 真正的语义来自递归收敛到语义一致性，而不是简单的符号模拟，呼吁开发新的认知架构。

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何在复杂社会动态中构建信任、抵抗误导，并有效融入群体智能，以提高多智能体系统协作效率。

Method: 提出名为KAIROS的基准测试平台，模拟具有多重条件控制（如专家-新手角色等）的多智能体知识竞赛，通过对历史互动记录和当前输入对LLMs进行测试，并比较不同优化策略（如提示、监督微调及GRPO）的效果。

Result: 采用GRPO结合多智能体上下文的方式在综合性能上表现最佳，但其对社会影响的鲁棒性较Base模型有所下降。

Conclusion: 尽管优化可以提升性能，但仍需在性能与社交鲁棒性之间权衡，以确保LLMs在复杂社交动态中表现良好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Motivation: 随着多语言内容的增长，视觉障碍用户面临的网页无障碍难题日益严重，现有研究缺乏大规模数据集支持，因此需要解决此方面的研究空白。

Method: 作者开发了LangCrUX数据集，并通过其对多语言网页无障碍性进行了系统分析，提出Kizuki工具以应对语言数据不一致的问题。

Result: 发现无障碍提示未能充分反映多语言内容的语言多样性，导致屏幕阅读器效果减弱，网页无障碍性大打折扣。

Conclusion: 通过引入LangCrUX数据集和Kizuki工具，为多语言网页无障碍性研究提供了新的视角和工具，有望改善这类用户的数字体验。

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Motivation: 当前LVLMs在视觉信息理解方面表现卓越，但其多语言能力仍存在不均衡，需要提高其多语言理解能力。

Conclusion: PLAST方法实现高效的多语言提升，适用于低资源及复杂视觉推理任务，提高视觉信息的语言特定参与性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）虽然在企业中被广泛应用，但也带来了潜在风险，尤其是在缺乏用于检测的高质量标注数据的情况下。

Method: 研究提出了一种反向提示（backprompting）方法结合人工环路聚类技术，生成并标注模拟真实LLM输出的数据，并将此数据与现有数据集结合用于训练检测器。

Result: 实验表明，这种方法尤其在检测语言模型中健康建议方面表现出色，检测器性能优于GPT-4o高达3.73%，且模型参数仅为GPT-4o的1/400。

Conclusion: 反向提示和人工干预技术有效生成高质量训练数据，显著提高了检测器性能，为开发更加可靠的语言模型防护措施提供了新方向。

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

TL;DR: 提出Integral Transformer，改进传统自注意力机制，通过整合logit分布的采样信号来减少注意力噪声，且在多个语言基准测试中性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对自注意力机制中注意力噪声问题，特别是在负关注等方法可能丢失有用信息的情况下，提出更优解决方案的需求。

Method: 设计了一种新的自注意力机制（Integral Transformer），其通过整合从logit分布采样的信号来去噪，同时保留重要的特殊标记贡献。

Result: 在多个语言知识与推理基准上表现出超越标准、自觉注意力及变化式变压器的优越性能，并发现初级层中采用标准注意力机制可提升性能，而在高层中有效平衡注意力分布并减少秩崩塌。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer不仅减少了自注意力机制的噪声，还保留了关键标记的贡献，整体提升了模型性能，提供了一种平衡注意力分布的新方法。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Latent Self-Consistency（LSC）的新方法，用于选择语义一致的答案，解决了现有方法在短答案和长答案应用中的准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自一致性方法（如SC、USC和WUCS）在短答案或长答案的处理上存在准确性或一致性问题，特别是在复杂或长形式问题中。

Method: 引入了一个基于可学习的Token嵌入的语义一致性方法LSC，通过轻量化的摘要Token生成过程，仅增加不到1%的推理时间，无需更改模型架构。

Result: LSC在6个短答案和5个长答案推理基准测试中优于现有的SC、USC和WUCS方法，且几乎没有计算开销。同时，它在两种答案格式中保持了良好的置信度校准。

Conclusion: LSC是一种高效实用的一致性选择方法，具有跨答案格式可靠的性能，并提供出色的置信度估计能力。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both

### [82] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现有AI模型中基于数据集分布外（OOD）评估方法的局限性，尤其在QA任务中的问题表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型常通过OOD评估泛化能力，但这一方法依赖于假设：OOD评估能够真实反映实际部署中的可能失败。然而，这种假设可能存在问题，尤其是部分QA模型容易依赖虚假特征或预测捷径。

Method: 将现有QA模型的OOD评估结果与记录的一些具体失败模式进行对比研究，解析其关于虚假特征和预测捷径的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现用于QA任务的多种OOD数据集在模型鲁棒性预测方面质量差异显著，有些甚至不如简单的同分布评估（ID）。部分原因在于虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集中被共享，另一些原因则与训练评估数据的质量脱节相关。

Conclusion: 当前常用的OOD评估方法在泛化能力评价上存在局限性。本文指出其问题并提供更健全的泛化评估建议，适用于QA及更广泛领域。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究分析了不同训练方法对大语言模型(LLMs)在语义理解和重新排序任务中的影响，并评估其解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs语义理解能力的提升，它们表现出更高的人类价值观对齐，但透明性下降。作者希望通过分析模型的运作方式，提高模型的解释能力并解决数据不足的排序问题。

Method: 利用环境与地球科学领域的小型排序数据集，研究不同训练方法对LLMs重新排序任务的影响，并分析其生成解释信息的能力。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法的解释能力优于其他方法，表明LLMs的语义理解并不全面，可能只是通过抽象知识优化评估。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs表现出较好的排序能力，但存在透明性和可靠性问题。改进模型的训练方法和解释能力是重要研究方向。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

TL;DR: 论文研究如何通过调整大型语言模型（LLM）来解决波兰语中的性别偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过波兰语中的语言性别偏见导致大型语言模型生成输出中的性别失衡，进一步加剧了不公平现象，因此研究试图通过改进语言模型以解决该问题。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（包含性别包容性校对和翻译指南）调整多语言和波兰语特定的大型语言模型，并设计明确包含性别包容性的提示框架。

Result: 实验表明，通过调整后的模型可以更好地在波兰语生成中纳入性别包容性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决波兰语中的性别偏见问题提供了系统解决方案，使得模型生成更具包容性。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对大语言模型中生成幻觉内容的问题，因为幻觉内容可能听起来可信但实际错误甚至无意义。

Method: 将幻觉检测表述为假设检验问题，借鉴机器学习中分布外检测的思想，提出基于多重检验的方法。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，与现有的最先进方法相比，该方法展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的多重检验方法有效解决了幻觉检测问题，为提高语言模型可靠性做出了贡献。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出两种改进机器翻译自动评价指标的模型，通过额外信息提高评价性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出针对现有自动化评价指标未利用多翻译可能性的问题，旨在改善机器翻译质量评估。

Method: COMET-polycand利用同一原句的多种翻译进行对比评价。COMET-polyic则结合相似原句的翻译及其人工质量评分进行指导。

Result: COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic显著提高了与人工评估的相关性，比如降低Kendall's tau-b相关系数从0.079提升到0.118。

Conclusion: 通过纳入多种翻译及相关上下文信息，可以显著提升机器翻译自动指标的评估性能。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

TL;DR: 提出一种视觉隐喻生成框架，结合训练自由和基于训练的方法，通过自我评估优化隐喻对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本隐喻生成视觉图像的难题，需要语言理解和视觉连贯性，并提高隐喻对齐的效果。

Method: 结合新提出的隐喻分解得分和意义对齐度量，探索训练自由的提示分解方法（S-T-M映射）及基于轻量化强化学习的训练方法。

Result: 在测试集中，训练自由方法在分解、CLIP和意义对齐指标上表现优于闭源基线，基于训练方法紧随其后；用户研究显示GPT-4o整体优越，但训练自由方法对抽象隐喻表现出色。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级RL方法在有限的计算资源下，能较好地实现隐喻对齐，但人类偏好与模型输出的剩余差距主要与美学和采样有关。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

Conclusion: 语言不仅用于表达内在状态，还具有生成新语言的功能。变压器与人类使用语言的方式不同，但两者都展现了各自的特点与能力。

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Motivation: 现有的英译西电子健康记录翻译因缺乏平行语料库及众多生僻词导致性能受限。

Method: 引入NOOV系统，利用自动学习的双语词典和从生物医学知识中提取的短语查找表，改善NMT性能。

Result: NOOV有效生成更准确流畅的电子健康记录翻译。

Conclusion: NOOV证明在缺少领域内语料库的情况下，可以显著提高翻译质量。

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

Motivation: 解决LLM因规模过大导致部署困难的问题，同时弥补量化模型缩放规律研究中对PTQ特定参数及任务敏感度的忽视。

Method: 提出了一种分解LLM知识为记忆与利用能力的任务分层方法，开发了结合模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和分组大小的定量框架，并进行广泛的实证研究。

Result: 发现LLM的知识记忆能力对有效位宽、校准集大小及模型大小的变化更为敏感，而知识利用能力则相对鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究为开发能够更好保存目标认知功能的量化策略提供了指导，并细化了PTQ对LLM知识能力影响的理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

<details>

Motivation: 由于人类在解决复杂问题时往往经过深思熟虑却未明说内在思想和方法，导致训练数据中缺乏必要的推理信息，从而使得大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现不佳。

Method: 在推理流程中插入中间“洞见”，回顾最新状态并开启下一推理步骤；设计自动化流程以收集和筛选上下文示例，从而生成“洞见”提升推理能力，无需人工标注或模型微调。

Conclusion: TBYS框架为改善大语言模型的复杂推理能力提供了一种创新性解决方案，通过生成和利用“洞见”优化思维流程，显著提高了模型的推理表现和解题技巧。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为CoDe的解码框架，以改进大型语言模型在结合外部知识生成响应时的忠实性和表达性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型难以在引入外部知识时平衡生成内容的忠实性和自然表达能力，导致模型输出要么失去与外部知识的关联，要么显得冗长且不自然。

Method: 引入Collaborative Decoding (CoDe)框架，通过对比输出概率分布和模型信任度，动态结合含有外部知识和纯模型知识的生成信息，同时加入知识感知的重新排序机制，以防止模型过度依赖内在知识。

Result: 实验证明，CoDe框架能在多种大型语言模型和评估指标中提高响应的忠实性，同时不损失表达性。

Conclusion: CoDe框架能够有效且通用地改善大型语言模型在结合外部知识场景下的输出质量，突破了忠实性和表达性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: 本文提出Emotion Omni模型，旨在通过理解用户语音输入中的情感内容生成富有同理心的语音响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型多直接将响应内容转化为语音，缺乏对用户查询中情感和副语言线索的深入理解，影响用户体验。

Method: 提出Emotion Omni新模型架构，通过自主开发的数据生成流程构建了一个基于开源TTS框架的20万条情感对话数据集，支持构建同理心语音助手。

Result: Emotion Omni能理解用户情感内容，生成具有同理心的语音响应。

Conclusion: Emotion Omni在数据有限情况下实现了情感理解和同理心语音响应生成的突破，为高效情感语音交互提供了新的思路和技术支持。

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

Motivation: 传统的MCoT提示设计使用随机或人工选择的示例，难以考虑模型知识分布和任务复杂性，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出了一种基于“因材施教”原则的提示课程设计框架，结合模型感知的难度（通过预测分歧量化）和样本的内在复杂性，进行难度平衡的示例采样。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的基准和多个流行的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)上进行了广泛的实验，显示方法能显著且持续地改进性能。

Conclusion: 这是一种经过验证的、可靠的多模态推理增强方法，可解决随机采样导致的不稳定性，提高模型表现。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文揭示当前医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）在医学视觉问答任务中对语义等价问题的重述存在答案不一致的问题，并提出了一个名为CCL的方法来提升答案一致性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学应用中需要模型对不同表述的医疗问题有一致性的回答，然而现有模型在遇到语义等价重述时稳定性不足。

Method: 作者构建了一个名为RoMed的大规模数据集，并提出了一种结合知识锚定一致性学习与偏差感知对比学习的CCL方法，用于提升模型性能与一致性。

Result: 通过实验表明，与其他基准模型相比，CCL方法在三个VQA基准数据集上达到了最佳性能，并在RoMed测试集中显著提高了50%的答案一致性。

Conclusion: CCL方法显著提高了Med-VLMs在医学领域的回答一致性与鲁棒性，为解决关键的适用性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

Motivation: 尽管语音大语言模型在一般领域中表现优异，但其在处理特定领域术语或新词生成上有明显的局限性，因此需要改进的方法。

Method: 通过跨注意力权重将语音与术语的关联性转化为出现概率，并结合课程学习策略提高检索准确性。此外还创建了一个包含术语的新型语音数据集来支持研究。

Conclusion: 该方法表明，利用Attention2Probability提升术语干预的准确性，能够显著提升模型的特定领域适应性，但也揭示了当前SLM在术语利用上的局限。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

### [97] [Filtering for Creativity: Adaptive Prompting for Multilingual Riddle Generation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18709)
*Duy Le,Kent Ziti,Evan Girard-Sun,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为自适应原创性过滤（AOF）的方法，用于提高多语言谜语生成的质量，减少重复，同时保持文化和语言的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言谜语生成面临平衡文化流利性与创造性抽象的挑战，且传统语言模型容易生成重复或浅显改写内容。

Method: 提出一种名为AOF的提示框架，通过基于余弦相似性的过滤机制拒绝冗余生成，同时强制实现字面新颖性和跨语言忠实性，提高生成效果。

Result: 在多个语言模型和语言对上验证，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上表现尤为优异，显著提升词汇多样性并减少了重复。

Conclusion: 语义过滤可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下，引导生成具有文化根基和创造性的内容。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何应对恶意利用大语言模型（LLMs）的风险，尤其是在客户服务中的用户冒充问题，提出了一种名为EMMM的解释与检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在客户服务领域的快速采用，恶意行为者可能滥用这些模型进行大规模用户冒充，现有检测方法在互动式对话中表现欠佳，尤其在非专家用户场景中需要更加可解释性的解决方案。

Method: 本文提出一种名为EMMM的框架，通过结合解释性与检测能力，同时兼顾延迟、精度和对非专家用户的友好性，提供更可靠的MGT检测方法。

Result: 实验显示，EMMM具备良好的可解释性，70%的评估者更喜欢该方法的输出，同时在精度上与先进模型相当，并能在不到1秒内生成输出。

Conclusion: EMMM框架在确保检测精度的同时，提高了非专家用户的可操作性，展示了其在实际客户服务场景中的潜力，并开源了相关代码和数据集。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

TL;DR: 提出了DIVER框架，用于在优化广告标题质量的同时提高其多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法注重质量或点击率，忽视了标题的多样性，导致结果同质化，亟需解决。

Method: 设计语义和风格感知的数据生成管道生成高质量训练数据，结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），提出多阶段多目标优化框架，实现单次模型推理生成高质量多样化标题。

Result: 在真实工业数据集实验中，DIVER框架成功在质量与多样性间取得平衡，并在数百万用户规模的内容平台上线后，广告商价值（ADVV）提高4.0%，点击率（CTR）提高1.4%。

Conclusion: DIVER框架展示了优化广告标题质量与多样性的成功实践，为工业级广告生成提供新方向。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出首次用于多模态、多场景的情感原因三元组抽取(MECTEC)数据集MECAD，并设计了一种新型模型M3HG，其通过多模态异构图显式捕捉情感和因果上下文并进行语义融合，实验结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有MECTEC数据集单一、模型未充分利用情感与因果上下文信息的问题，引入新的多模态、多场景数据集，同时优化模型设计以提高性能。

Method: 提出M3HG模型，利用多模态异构图显式建模情感和因果上下文，在句内与句间两个层次实现信息融合，并通过实验验证效果。

Result: M3HG模型在多个实验中效果优于现有最先进方法，同时提供新数据集MECAD，进一步推动了MECTEC研究。

Conclusion: M3HG显式建模和语义融合的方法有效提高了MECTEC任务的性能，MECAD数据集扩展了研究场景，为该领域的发展提供了新工具。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

*Byeongjeong Kim,Jeonghyun Park,Joonho Yang,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对叙事问答的优化方法ChronoRAG，解决了现有检索增强生成方法（RAG）在处理叙事文本时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG方法在处理叙事类长文本问答任务时，由于无法有效利用叙事文本的连贯性和时间顺序，导致性能不足。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，它通过提炼分散的信息为连贯结构，并显式捕捉和维护叙事文本的时间顺序来优化问答性能。

Result: 实验证明了ChronoRAG在NarrativeQA数据集上的表现显著优于传统方法，在需要事实识别和复杂顺序理解的任务中均表现突出。

Conclusion: ChronoRAG框架能够有效捕捉和利用叙事文本中的时间关系，表明时间顺序推理对叙事问答任务至关重要。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在推理时计算成本难以控制，研究人员希望开发一个开源框架，提供可控的推理模式。

Method: 提出了ThinkDial框架，通过预算模式的监督微调和分两阶段的预算感知强化学习来整合整个训练管道，实现三种离散推理模式的切换能力。

Result: 实验表明ThinkDial在减少生成长度的同时保持性能，并具备出色的任务外泛化能力。

Conclusion: ThinkDial是实现开源模型可控推理的重要里程碑，为兼顾性能和计算成本提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Motivation: 目前大型语言模型在语法错误校正任务中的应用研究不足且主要依赖监督微调，这限制了模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于规则的强化学习框架，通过实验验证其在中文数据集中的有效性。

Result: 该框架在实验中取得了目前最优的结果，尤其在召回率方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用强化学习来引导大型语言模型是一种更可控且可靠的语法错误校正新范式。

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Motivation: 尽管现代机器翻译系统在通用领域文本翻译上取得进展，但结构化的LaTeX格式文档因其包含自然语言和领域特定语法（如数学公式和交叉引用）仍难以翻译。

Method: 设计了由六个专门代理组成的多代理系统LaTeXTrans，包括解析器、翻译器、验证器、摘要器、术语提取器和生成器，协同完成LaTeX文档的翻译，同时确保格式保真和用词一致。

Result: 实验结果表明，LaTeXTrans在翻译精准度和结构保真性上优于主流机器翻译系统。

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans是一个有效且实用的解决方案，可以翻译LaTeX格式文档，保持语义完整性和编译性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在捕获长距离依赖、复杂语义关系以及社交动态上的不足，同时减少对标注数据集的依赖。

Method: 通过结合抽象意义表示（AMR）和新闻传播动态，引入LLM生成的负锚点进行对比学习，并使用多视图图掩码自动编码器学习社交背景传播特征。

Result: 自监督框架在有限标注数据下仍优于最新方法，同时具备良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在不依赖大量标注数据的情况下，可有效区分虚假新闻和真实新闻，并体现出强大的性能和一般化能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs在高风险领域中表现出高置信度却错误回答的现象，即“过度自信”，因此需要一种更有效的可信度校准方法。

Method: 提出ConfTuner，这是一种简单高效的微调方法，使用一种新的损失函数“tokenized Brier分数”，无需依赖真实置信度分数或代理估计值。

Result: ConfTuner改进了语言模型在各种推理任务中的校准能力，并能够推广到黑盒模型（如GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 更好的校准能力不仅提升了模型的可靠性，还在自我修正和模型级联等下游任务上带来显著提升，为构建可信赖的大型语言模型系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt有效提升了通过进化算法进行自动提示的水平，是当前领域内效果显著的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

Motivation: 许多参与计算教育研究的实践者希望改进自己的教学实践，但由于缺乏资源和能力，难以进行高质量和普适性的研究。

Method: 提出了LACA方法，将内容分析与LLM结合，帮助研究人员以可重复及严谨的方式处理大量文本数据。

Result: 通过计算教育领域的数据集演示了LACA方法的可操作性与严谨性，证明其在推动更普适性研究中的潜力。

Conclusion: LACA方法在计算教育研究中具有潜力，可以帮助改进研究与实践质量，并推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

Motivation: 了解情感极化是否在欧洲议会中普遍存在以及探讨其规律和机制。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术分析六个欧洲国家议会的演讲语料库，比较对对方议员与自己团体议员的负面情绪表达水平。

Result: 发现所有六个欧洲议会均存在情感极化现象，且活跃议员与不活跃议员之间在情感极化水平上无显著差异。此外，互惠机制是情感极化的驱动因素。

Conclusion: 情感极化在欧洲议会中普遍存在，需进一步关注其对政治讨论的影响及探讨潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

### [112] [Diverse And Private Synthetic Datasets Generation for RAG evaluation: A multi-agent framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18929)
*Ilias Driouich,Hongliu Cao,Eoin Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多代理框架，用于生成语义多样且隐私保护的RAG评估合成数据集，以提升其评价效果的可信度和全面性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前RAG系统评估的研究重点主要在性能指标的改进上，而对于评估数据集的设计与质量研究较少，尽管其对实现可靠评估至关重要。

Method: 本文提出一个结合了多代理协作的框架，包括：(1)利用聚类技术提高话题覆盖和语义多样性的Diversity Agent，(2)检测并屏蔽敏感信息的Privacy Agent，以及(3)生成兼顾隐私与多样性的QA对的QA Curation Agent。

Result: 通过实验，评估数据集在多样性和隐私屏蔽方面优于基线方法，证明其在领域专属数据集上的强健性。

Conclusion: 该研究为实现更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估提供了切实和符合伦理的路径，同时为未来的AI法规与合规标准的改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

TL;DR: 提出了一种框架，允许神经模型开发具备直觉推理、符号组合及可解释性的AI母语，用于提升模型的符号化能力和决策透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经模型缺乏直观解释及符号推理能力的问题。

Method: 通过嵌入直观推理机制，结合符号模式捕捉、推理链记录及门控机制，同时引入训练目标以增强符号纯度和决策稀疏性，并采用顺序专业化策略优化模型的符号能力和直觉判断。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在AI任务中具有竞争性精度，同时提供可验证的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: AI母语可以作为统一机制，在神经模型中实现可解释性、直观性和符号推理能力。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Conclusion: DistillPrompt被确立为非梯度自动提示方法中最有效的方法之一，验证了其在优化提示的显著潜力。

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which is gaining popularity due to the rapid development of
prompt engineering driven by extensive research in the field of large language
models (LLMs). This paper presents DistillPrompt -- a novel autoprompting
method based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of
task-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt
utilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the
prompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for

model. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12%
across the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing
methods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective
non-gradient approaches in autoprompting.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights
into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with
more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content. Our project page,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在处理复杂长规划任务时缺乏宏观指导和持续监控，容易出现失败或偏航，因此需要一个解决这些问题的方法。

Method: 作者提出了HiPlan框架，离线阶段通过专家示例构建里程碑库，实现结构化经验重用；执行阶段通过自适应调整过往里程碑轨迹以生成详细指引。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的基准测试中，HiPlan显著超越了强基线，有效验证了分层组件的互补优势。

Conclusion: HiPlan框架能有效提升大语言模型在复杂任务中的决策能力，其分层规划策略提供了全局指导和局部监督，是一种成功的探索。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Motivation: 探讨医生意图在医生-患者对话中的变轨特性及其对诊断和治疗计划制定的影响。

Method: 根据SOAP框架与医学专家协作开发意图分类体系，对5000多条医生-患者对话转录进行了大规模标注，并基于生成模型和编码器模型对数据集进行意图分类的性能测试。

Result: 模型能高效识别医疗对话的一般结构，但在SOAP类别切换时准确性较低；首次报告医疗对话结构中常见的变轨特性，为设计‘鉴别诊断’系统提供了新见解；意图筛选显著提升对话总结性能。

Conclusion: 研究贡献了一个重要的大规模标注医疗对话数据集，为未来医疗意图分析和对话总结研究提供了可借鉴的资源和方法，并公开了代码与数据集供科研使用。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

TL;DR: 本文分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）对极低资源语言的学习能力，特别是罕见文字的极低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨极低资源语言（尤其是罕见文字语言）被支持的可能性，通过分析是否可以仅通过上下文学习（ICL）以及与参数高效微调（PEFT）对比来实现。

Method: 系统评价了20种代表性不足的语言，应用当前三种最先进的多语言LLM，实验了零样本ICL、少样本ICL，以及PEFT的方法。

Result: PEFT在语言和文字极度不足表示时受限，而拥有语言对齐的零样本ICL在极低资源语言上表现出色，相对高资源的语言则适合少样本ICL或PEFT。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM从业者提供了关于适应极低资源语言的指导，建议避免对涉及未见过文字的语言进行微调。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Method: 通过语义检索和上下文摘要构建一种支持自然语言及多语言搜索的系统，并用Getty Provenance Index的拍卖记录样本评估其表现。

Result: 该方法在标注的10,000条记录样本中展现出在艺术品市场档案检索中的可扩展性与实用性。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统为历史学家和文化遗产专家提供了一个有效工具，用于处理历史敏感的艺术品研究。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

Conclusion: 提出了一个透明高效的话语分析工作流，强调代码透明性、研究者主导性和方法三角验证的重要性，并公开代码和材料。

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LVLMs在VQA任务中如何感知其知识边界、评估模型的置信能力，并改善其预测可靠性。

Method: 引入了三种置信信号（概率置信、基于答案一致性的置信、和语言化置信）评估LVLMs的知识感知能力；从LLMs适配信心校准方法并提出三种改进方法。

Result: 实验表明概率和一致性基准的信号更可靠，而语言化信心信号容易导致过度自信；整合视觉与语言输入的LVLMs在VQA性能上略逊于LLMs，但在感知层面有所提高。

Conclusion: LVLMs对其知识边界的感知较合理，但需改进；适配校准技术有效改善模型置信能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的评估与分析框架能够揭示科学推理性能上的新见解，以助力提升LLMs在科学问题中的表现。

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: VibeVoice在语音合成质量和计算效率上超越现有对话模型。

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前PLS领域广泛使用的可读性评估方法效果有限，亟需更准确的评价指标。

Method: 评估了8种传统可读性指标与人类可读性判断的相关性，并测试语言模型在评估可读性方面的表现。

Result: 发现大多数传统可读性指标与人类判断相关性较低，而语言模型的表现更优，最高相关性达到0.56。同时，语言模型能更好地评估如背景知识需求等深层次的可读性指标。

Conclusion: 语言模型在PLS评估中更具优势，建议采用语言模型优化可读性评估，推动领域发展。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

Conclusion: 生成界面显著提升了用户体验，研究为未来以人机交互为核心的人工智能技术发展提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为TAFA的非贪婪框架来解决主动特征获取问题，通过学习特征模板库以进行特征选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实例自适应的主动特征获取中存在难以处理的MDP或无法充分考虑特征联合信息带来的限制。

Method: 提出了Template-based AFA (TAFA)，通过学习一个特征模板库，利用模板指导特征选择，减少动作空间并避免估计数据分布。

Result: 实验证明，TAFA在多个数据集上表现优于目前的最先进的方法，同时降低了获取成本和计算成本。

Conclusion: TAFA通过特征模板学习，有效提升了主动特征获取的性能，并且具有更低的获取和计算开销。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PKG-DPO框架，用于确保AI系统的物理有效性，特别是在金属连接等高风险领域。相比其他方法，PKG-DPO有更少的约束违反和更高的物理评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLMs和偏好优化技术在处理科学领域复杂物理现象时效果有限，尤其在像金属连接这样的高风险场景中，需要确保物理有效性。

Method: 提出了PKG-DPO框架，包括三个核心部分：层次物理知识图、物理推理引擎和物理验证评估套件，旨在通过强化物理约束来提高偏好学习的物理一致性。

Result: PKG-DPO实现了17%更少的约束违例，物理评分提高11%，参数精度提高12%，推理质量提升7%。

Conclusion: PKG-DPO框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还能推广至其他多尺度、物理驱动的领域，提供一种科学化约束嵌入的方法，对AI偏好优化技术有重要贡献。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多个AI代理间交互对合作行为的影响，使用经典经济学游戏模拟分析不同模型下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在工具使用和长时间任务中的应用增多，AI间交互的重要性愈发突出，亟需研究这种交互对行为的影响。

Method: 通过改编迭代公共物品博弈游戏，比较AI模型在认为对手为其他AI代理或自身时的行为差异，并分析四种推理与非推理模型在不同条件下的合作倾向。

Result: 研究表明，告诉大语言模型（LLMs）其对手是自身，与告诉其对手是其他AI时，在合作倾向上有显著差异。

Conclusion: 尽管研究在模拟环境中进行，但结果对理解AI在多代理场景中潜在的无意识行为偏差及其对合作程度的影响提供了启示。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何使用语言模型（LM）生成Python程序，作为解决PDDL问题的一般化策略，公开了超越传统方法的效果。此外，研究发现LM在符号表示的PDDL问题中意外表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是研究如何有效利用语言模型（LM）在规划领域中生成针对特定领域的通用策略，比传统PDDL规划器和现有方法表现更优。

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python代码来充当通用策略，这种代码无须外部验证即可在PDDL规划中可靠使用。

Result: 实验表明，本文方法在时间和内存受限条件下能解决更多PDDL问题。LMPlan可以处理包含数百个对象的复杂规划问题，并在特定符号化问题中表现优于自然语言。

Conclusion: 本文方法证明了语言模型在规划领域的潜力，同时挑战了语言模型依赖语义和训练数据记忆的假设。

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

TL;DR: 本文引入了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的新超参数，分析其对搜索和规划任务的影响，并在多个规划领域中确定了一组最优超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的深度学习方法在符号规划中的搜索价值函数学习上表现不够理想，该研究希望通过研究WLFs的新超参数改善性能。

Method: 引入新的WLFs超参数，并在单核CPU上运行100万次规划实验，分析这些超参数对训练与规划的影响。

Result: 实验表明，不同规划领域存在一组通用且最佳的WLF超参数，这些参数更多倾向于最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。

Conclusion: WLFs超参数的优化能显著改善规划任务性能，但训练指标与规划指标无显著相关性。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的新颖性启发式方法无法很好地处理对称状态，可能导致冗余探索，因此需要开发一种对称性不变的新方法。

Method: 通过使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征（WLFs），从经典规划领域生成对称性不变的、新颖性启发式方法，并通过无监督过程进行优化。

Result: 在经典国际规划比赛与难以归约的基准套件中的实验表明，采用WLFs生成的新颖性启发式方法表现出令人期待的结果。

Conclusion: WLFs可以无监督地用于生成对称性不变的新颖性启发式方法，提升规划中的搜索效率。

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜行游戏中的警卫巡逻系统依赖于手工设计的路径或专用逻辑，难以在覆盖效率、快速响应和自然性之间达到平衡。

Method: 提出了一种基于复合势场（Composite Potential Fields）的通用框架，通过集成信息、信心和连通性三种可解释地图，结合参数化的设计者控制方法，平滑适配不同场景，不需要重新训练。

Result: 在五个代表性游戏地图、两种玩家控制策略和五种警卫模式下，验证了方法在抓捕效率和巡逻自然性上优于经典基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法兼容常见的潜行机制（如分散注意力的工具和环境元素），能够快速原型化动态和响应式的警卫行为，为潜行游戏开发提供强大的工具支持。

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Conclusion: 通过基于数据库的可扩展基础，加速复杂3D关卡和可配置游戏进程的自动生成，为程序化内容生成提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一种全自动的日志模式提取框架，解决了依赖正则表达式的限制，显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的日志模式提取方法严重依赖正则表达式，需要人力干预，限制了自动化和效率提升。

Method: 提出SchemaCoder框架，通过上下文分段、基于嵌入的采样、Q-Tree驱动的层级模型查询以及文本残差优化机制，进行迭代式日志模式提取。

Result: 在LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder较现有最优方法平均提升了21.3%。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder展示了无需人工定制即可广泛适用于多种日志格式的潜力，为日志模式提取的自动化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: 目前皮肤病学数据集缺乏足够的种族和疾病多样性，限制了AI诊断模型的准确性和公平性，因此开发一个新数据集以提升NTDs诊断的重要性。

Method: 收集自科特迪瓦和加纳的5,623张影像数据，涵盖了47种皮肤疾病，结合AI和专家以语言模型及分割模型生成多模态标注数据。

Conclusion: eSkinHealth为全球皮肤病学AI工具的开发提供了宝贵资源及可扩展的注释框架，将促进全球健康诊断的公平性与准确性。

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观质量和客观约束能力。单一奖励策略不能同时提升两方面表现，固定权重的混合奖励方法缺乏适应性。

Method: 引入了一种动态混合奖励系统RLMR，通过写作奖励模型评价主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循度，并动态调整约束奖励权重，结合GRPO优化进行训练。

Result: 在参数范围8B到72B的模型上进行自动和人工评估，用构建的真实写作基准WriteEval全面测试，模型表现显著提升，指令遵循和写作质量均有所提高。

Conclusion: RLMR是首个将主观偏好与客观验证结合的在线强化学习方法，成功优化了多维度创意写作性能。

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法未能将真实动态用户融入训练过程中，限制了智能代理在多轮复杂交互中使用工具解决用户需求的能力。

Method: 提出MUA-RL框架，通过将LLM模拟用户融入强化学习循环训练，使代理能够更好地理解用户需求并使用工具解决问题。

Conclusion: MUA-RL实现了在动态多轮交互中增强智能代理工具使用能力，为强化学习领域提供了一种将用户模拟融入交互的新视角。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models

Motivation: 现有的LLM代理大多仅为被动性地响应用户指令，这限制了其作为信息获取平台的效率和通用性，因此需要开发更加主动的信息采集系统。

Conclusion: 该方法改变了传统的被动信息获取模式，对人类社会的信息处理与获取方式产生了深远的影响。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

### [141] [VistaWise: Building Cost-Effective Agent with Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph for Minecraft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18722)
*Honghao Fu,Junlong Ren,Qi Chai,Deheng Ye,Yujun Cai,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VistaWise通过整合跨模态领域知识和优化目标检测模型，极大降低领域特定训练数据需求，同时在虚拟开放世界任务中实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在虚拟开放世界中的决策任务表现良好，但缺乏领域特定知识，导致整体性能受限。

Method: 设计VistaWise框架，利用跨模态知识图谱整合视觉与文本信息，优化目标检测模型，并采用基于检索的池化策略和桌面技能库。

Result: 实验结果显示VistaWise在多种开放世界任务中达到最新性能水平，证明其在降低开发成本的同时提升了系统性能。

Conclusion: VistaWise框架有效解决了领域特定数据需求高昂的问题，并优化了多模态环境中的任务表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

*Karanbir Singh,Deepak Muppiri,William Ngu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Bias Mitigation Agent的多智能体系统，以解决智能体AI中的信息偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的发展导致了能够自主行动的目标导向系统的发展，但这些系统因信息来源的偏见问题影响公平性和用户信任。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，调整信息来源选择流程，以实现相关性高、偏见少的信息检索。

Result: 实验显示，与基础的简单检索策略相比，偏见降低了81.82%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效减少了信息偏见，为推广公平且平衡的知识提供了支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

### [143] [CAC-CoT: Connector-Aware Compact Chain-of-Thought for Efficient Reasoning Data Synthesis Across Dual-System Cognitive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18743)
*Sunguk Choi,Yonghoon Kwon,Heondeuk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为CAC-CoT的方法，通过限制语言模型的推理过程使用固定的小型连接短语集，提高推理效率且保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链式推理在复杂任务中有效，但在快速直觉任务中可能导致效率降低。本文旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: 采用Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT)方法，限制推理过程仅使用固定连接短语，从而获得紧凑且结构化的推理。

Result: CAC-CoT在GSM8K上取得约85%的准确率，在GPQA (System-2)上约40%，同时在S1-Bench (System-1)上保留约90%的准确率。推理迹长约300词，仅为基线方法的三分之一。

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法通过降低推理迹长度，提供了更高的效率，同时保证了推理准确率。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架REMO，以解决现有prompt优化方法的局限性，通过存储和利用优化历史经验，实现任务性能的持续改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的prompt优化方法如TextGrad，存在缺乏历史优化经验利用和易过拟合的问题，导致较差的泛化能力。

Method: 引入名为Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization (REMO)的框架，其中结合了记忆增强的反射检索生成模块及由大语言模型驱动的自适应优化器，以实现细粒度与跨运行的系统级提示优化。

Result: 在数学推理基准GSM8K上，REMO相比TextGrad展现出更稳健的泛化能力，但计算开销更大。

Conclusion: REMO能够通过持续积累和利用跨运行优化知识，改进大语言模型的提示优化效果，虽有一定计算开销但具有良好前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

### [145] [Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751)
*Byung-Joon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种方法应对深度神经网络在实际场景中因域转换而表现下降的问题，提出了Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF)和Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP)以改进开放集测试时的适应性和准确性，并在多种数据集上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试分布一致时表现优异，但在遇到域转换或开放集数据时表现会显著下降，现有方法在开放集下的适配能力有限。因此，有必要研究一种更有效的开放集测试时适应方法。

Method: 提出两种新的方法：1. Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF)，通过辅助过滤器进一步验证主要过滤器筛选的数据，提升开放集数据辨别能力；2. Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP)，通过将适配模型、指数移动平均(EMA)模型和源模型的输出校准整合，利用它们的互补知识提升预测效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，与现有方法相比，本文方法在多种开放集和封闭集数据集上均能提升封闭集准确率及开放集辨别能力。

Conclusion: PAF和KIP两种方法有效解决了开放集测试时的域适应问题，为提升实际场景中的深度学习模型性能提供了新的方向，可以同时提升开放集区分与封闭集分类的性能。代码已公开，便于复现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Motivation: LRMs在执行复杂推理任务上表现优异，但对于缺乏足够信息的问题，无法适当表现出放弃。这种缺陷限制了其作为可信赖人工智能系统的潜力。

Method: 研究分析了LRMs在不可回答问题上的响应行为，发现其认知能力和外在反应存在不一致。研究者提出一种两阶段方法：将认知监控与推理干预相结合，在推理过程中检测并调整其对不可回答问题的反应。

Result: 实验表明所提方法显著提高了LRMs在不可回答问题上的放弃响应率，同时维持整体推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过两阶段方法解决了LRMs在不可回答问题中表现不当的缺陷，改善了其在可信AI领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Conclusion: 通过令牌级多模型协作和词汇对齐技术，有效提升了语言模型的推理能力，方法优越，代码公开可用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

TL;DR: 论文提出STARec框架，通过引入慢思考增强推荐系统，显著提升了在数据稀缺条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统和基于大型语言模型的推荐代理在用户建模和决策中存在静态性和浅层偏差问题。

Method: 提出一个具有慢思维能力的STARec框架，结合结构化知识提炼和偏好奖励塑造，通过两阶段训练提高模型推理和适应能力。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs数据集上，STARec在仅使用0.4%训练数据的情况下实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: STARec框架的自主推理能力能够有效应对当前推荐系统的局限，为未来的推荐系统研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律作为高风险领域，急需理解LLMs的实际能力与局限性，从而明确AI在司法决策中的适用场景。

Method: 以IRAC（问题、规则、应用、结论）模型分解司法推理的核心需求，并将改良技术如RAG、多代理系统与神经符号AI映射到法律解析关键环节，评价其在处理复杂法律问题中的效果。

Result: 目前技术可解决一些具体法律挑战，但在需要裁量权和透明解释的任务上仍存在重大障碍。

Conclusion: AI法律应用的最佳现状是：在简单重复案件中为高效助手，在复杂案件中作为专家的讨论伙伴。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Conclusion: 动态交互评估对于推动协同代码生成模型的开发具有重要意义。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Method: 提出了FormaRL框架，利用Lean编译器的语法检查和大语言模型的一致性检查作为奖励，采用GRPO算法更新形式器，仅需少量未标注数据。此外，构建了包含本科数学材料的证明问题数据集——uproof。

Result: FormaRL显著提高了Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的pass@1自动形式化准确率；在ProofNet和uproof上分别提高了4到6倍，并在分布外问题上表现出色。

Conclusion: FormaRL框架在有限数据条件下，能够显著提升自动形式化任务的表现，为形式验证领域提供了新的方法，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

Result: CTGraph能够提供学生学习过程的全貌，识别困难学生，并定位学生学习问题的时间和地点。

Conclusion: 提供了丰富的学生学习洞察，为教育者提供依据，从而实现更有针对性的干预。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于最近邻方法和分层聚类结构的替代方法，有效解决神经网络中的多种局限性问题，如幻觉效应、高计算复杂度和灾难性遗忘等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络（如大语言模型）在应用领域成功显著，但存在幻觉效应、训练和推理复杂性高、微调成本高以及灾难性遗忘问题，限制了其在医疗、工业和科学研究中的应用。

Method: 引入基于最近邻和分层聚类结构的方法，结合k近邻算法减少幻觉效应，并采用基于Kohonen自组织映射的树形数据结构加速最近邻搜索。

Result: 在手写数字识别和翻译任务测试中验证了方法的有效性，减少了搜索时间的同时精度仅略有降低。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制一致，在需要高可靠性和解释性结果的任务中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在内存受限的消费者级硬件上优化专家混合模型（MoE）的部署，提出了基于专家重要性和缓存专家复用的策略，显著降低了内存使用和数据传输开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然在大语言模型扩展中表现突出，但在内存有限的消费者级边缘硬件上实施面临挑战。因此需要设计更高效的专家调度和内存管理方案。

Method: 提出基于专家重要性的专家替换方法，结合高效的GPU缓存专家复用调度策略，以保证系统性能与精度。

Result: 通过实验显示，这种方法在基本不损失精度的情况下，将解码延迟降低48%，并实现60%以上的专家缓存命中率。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了消费者级硬件上的专家调度问题，在内存效率和计算性能方面取得显著提升，同时保持了近似无损的模型精度。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交认知的获取以及是否需要具身社会经验，探讨大语言模型能否通过语言统计学习实现文化理解。

Method: 通过两项研究评估不同AI系统预测针对555个日常情景的社会适宜性判断，并与人类参与者的判断进行比较。

Result: GPT-4.5在第1项研究中表现超过100%的人类参与者，第2项研究中，Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5与Claude Sonnet 4分别超过了98.7%、97.8%和96.0%的人类参与者。模型尽管具有高预测能力，但存在系统性错误。

Conclusion: 语言模型可以利用统计学习从语言数据中获得高级社会认知能力，这挑战了具身经验对于文化理解的独占性必要性，同时提示了基于模式的社会认知边界。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Motivation: 随着人工智能向通用智能发展，研究方向正从单一任务优化转向能持续学习的开放式智能体，作者旨在探索构建具有持续成长能力的自我演化智能体。

Method: 该论文引入ELL框架，基于四个核心原则：经验探索、长期记忆、技能学习及知识内化；同时提出StuLife基准数据集用于模拟动态环境中的终生学习情境，设计了工具来评估记忆保持、技能迁移及自发行为能力。

Result: 通过使用StuLife基准，验证了ELL框架在长期记忆保持、技能抽象迁移以及动态情境下的学习能力，同时分析了上下文工程在推动通用人工智能中的作用。

Conclusion: ELL框架为构建具备持续进化能力的智能体奠定了基础，StuLife提供了一个全面的平台评估终身学习性能，推动了从被动到主动、从上下文到记忆、从模仿到学习的范式转变。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究边缘性人格障碍（BPD）的时间性和自我属性，探讨语言模型在支持这种现象学定性分析中的可能性。

Method: 通过对24名住院患者的生命故事访谈进行再分析，比较了三种LLM（GPT-4o、Google Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Opus 4）在模仿原研究员解释风格方面的表现，专家从语义一致性和多维有效性等方面对模型输出进行了评估。

Result: 在与人类分析比较中，模型与人类的重叠程度从0%到58%不等，Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但发现了人类遗漏的主题，其中Gemini模型的结果有效性显著高于其他模型。

Conclusion: LLMs可以部分支持现象学定性分析，对减轻人类解释性偏见具有潜力，但与人类分析仍存在差距。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人工标注主观性强，NLP方法难以适应代数等符号领域，亟需一种客观的、可扩展的方法评估题目难度。

Method: 引入APME框架，采用逆变异系数和多臂老虎机模型，通过学生的得分和完成时间数据估算难度，无需语言特征或专家标注。

Result: 在三个异构数据集上平均R2为0.9213，RMSE为0.0584，表现优于回归、NLP及IRT方法，特别是在符号领域展现优势。

Conclusion: APME模型能解释并扩展到不同教育层次，支持适应性评估，且与维果茨基最近发展区理论一致，为基于学生数据的难度标注开辟新方向。

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的任务不足以评估LLMs在交互和未知环境中的推理能力，忽视了综合推理过程在人类发现现实世界中的重要性。

Method: 引入了一种新型评估范式“黑箱交互”，并构建了Oracle基准，包含6种黑箱任务和96个黑箱，测试LLMs与这些黑箱的交互推理能力。

Result: 测试了19个现代LLMs，其中o3在5种任务中排名第一，但在一些复杂任务中的表现不到40%，表明LLMs在高效和适应性探索策略的规划能力上存在不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在高层次规划方面表现出普遍的困难，需进一步研究提高其探索策略的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Conclusion: CMA框架验证了心灵社会理论的可行性，并为人工智能研究开辟了新的方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

TL;DR: 本文探讨大语言模型在处理数学问题时的推理能力局限，发现了一个新的“按难度扩展规律”，并提出一种名为结构化解决方案模板（SST）的框架，可以显著提高复杂任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法虽改进了大语言模型的性能，但在复杂任务上的深度逻辑推理能力仍不足，因此需要新的方式来教会模型有效的程序化推理。

Method: 作者提出SST框架，通过（1）使用结构化的解决方案模板链条进行微调，并动态调整权重来强调程序化逻辑，（2）在推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知辅助，（3）整合课程式微调，引导模型进行自我计划、自我执行和自我校正。

Result: 实验表明，SST框架在GSM8K，AIME24及新提出的动态En基准上显著提升了准确性和效率，尤其在难题上表现出色。

Conclusion: SST框架通过引入课程式教学和模板化推理，有效改善了大语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能，尤其是在高难度问题上的表现。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that

Motivation: 当前大规模推理模型在复杂的多步骤推理任务中表现出色，但传统依赖顺序查询的方法会增加推理延迟并降低整体效率和准确性。

Method: 提出 HDS-QA 数据集，该数据集包含混合跳跃式问题（结合并行和顺序查询），并通过微调 LRM 模型构建 HybridDeepSearcher，实现高效的推理路径优化。

Result: 实验中，HybridDeepSearcher 在多个基准测试上超过了最先进的基线模型，在 FanOutQA 和 BrowseComp 子集上分别提升了 +15.9 和 +11.5 的 F1 分数，同时减少了推理延迟并提高了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过显式训练 LRMs 来利用混合并行和顺序查询，不仅提升了推理效率和准确性，还展示了其在扩展性和低延迟推理中的显著优势。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Motivation: 当前，学习系统对日常决策的影响日益增加，探索通过用户端的算法集体行动（ACA）来协调更合理的数据分享是对传统监管与模型设计的一种补充。先前的研究主要集中于单一集体的设置，本论文旨在填补处理多个集体的理论空白。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Conclusion: 本文将玩法风格作为分析智能体决策行为的一种创新方法，不仅深化了对智能决策过程的理解，还为未来人工通用智能的构建提供了新的思路和方法。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了MATRIX，一个用于安全评估临床对话代理的框架。它通过系统性方式结合安全工程和对话评价，为监管对话系统提供了工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床对话系统评估大多关注任务完成和流畅性，缺乏对行为与风险管理需求的关注，而这些是安全关键系统的核心要求。

Method: MATRIX包含三个组件：(1)基于安全工程的方法提取的安全分类体系；(2)由LLM驱动的BehvJudge，能检测对话中的安全相关失败；(3)模拟患者代理PatBot，用于生成多样化、情景化的患者响应。

Result: 通过三个实验，证明MATRIX可进行系统、可扩展的安全性评估。BehvJudge在检测危害方面达到了接近专家的水平（F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999）；PatBot在模拟患者行为方面也展现了真实性，并成功在14种危险场景和10个临床领域中评估5种LLM代理。

Conclusion: MATRIX首次将结构化的安全工程与可扩展的对话AI评估相结合，提供了符合监管需求的安全审计能力，并开放了相关工具和数据集。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了StepWiser，一个生成式评估模型，利用步骤推理监督复杂问题中的解决过程，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理策略在解决复杂问题中已被广泛应用，但对这些中间步骤的逻辑有效性监督仍存在挑战，现有方法缺乏解释性且泛化能力有限。

Method: StepWiser将逐步奖励建模从分类任务转变为推理任务，通过生成思维标记并最终输出判断。采用基于回报结果的强化学习进行训练。

Result: StepWiser在中间步骤判断精度上优于现有方法，并在训练时提升策略模型性能，同时改善推理期间的搜索效果。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义步骤奖励建模为推理任务，StepWiser不仅改进了评估精度，还优化了训练与推理效果，为复杂问题求解带来了更好的监督方法。

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Method: 通过分析文献，提出MCP架构的五类分类法，探讨其作为标准化整合框架的潜力。

Result: 发现传统协议已到达局限，MCP结构支持语义互操作性，并符合AI驱动运输需求。

Conclusion: MCP有望成为下一代上下文感知和智能运输系统的基础，提供研究路线图。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business
applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent
framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate
environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate
complex business landscapes more effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于“思考深度”（DoT）的课程学习方法，通过教师模型的推理过程中的离散步骤数来量化任务难度，并依据该深度进行课程训练，验证了其在推理训练中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的课程学习方法在难度衡量上缺乏与认知推理能力的对齐，同时通常难以扩展并缺乏可解释性。

Method: 定义任务难度为“思考深度”（DoT），通过教师模型的推理轨迹计数离散步骤来度量难度；随后根据这些深度设计从浅到深的课程顺序，提供具体的导出、验证及大规模调度方法。

Result: 验证了思考深度（DoT）与传统推理基准的难度高度相关；DoT排序的课程在预算相同时优于基于长度或评分的课程；该难度定义在不同教师模型间具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过以认知为基础的可解释性训练课程方法，有助于提升在推理相关任务中的模型性能，并为后续以推理为核心的训练研究提供借鉴。

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Method: 开发了一个工具，在1秒内获取过去7天的应用使用数据；基于此数据采用多种机器学习模型识别抑郁与非抑郁用户，并使用特征选择技术优化模型性能。

Result: 使用轻量梯度增强机模型，在稳定特征选择方法下，识别准确率为82.4%，精确度为75%；组合模型使用精简特征后，最大精确度为77.4%，平衡准确率为77.9%。

Conclusion: 所开发的系统快速高效，适合资源有限的地区，可帮助识别和理解学生的抑郁行为，为发展低资源消耗的抑郁检测系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Result: 实验证明该框架在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面有显著提升，展现了其实用性和适用性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架提供了一种实用且模型无关的工具，可用于提高基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Conclusion: 研究为选择适用于APT检测的相似性函数提供了方法论支持，框架展示了在威胁情报和网络防御中的潜力。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明位置编码对于变换器处理序列依赖性至关重要，但传统方法在性能和复杂性上有改进空间。

Method: CoPE使用复数嵌入来替代传统位置编码，实部编码语义信息，虚部编码位置信息，并引入相位感知注意力机制，同时与线性注意力兼容。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试上，CoPE性能优于RoPE、正弦和学习位置编码，且计算复杂度更低。

Conclusion: CoPE提供了一种更高效的处理序列位置信息的方法，显著提升了变换器的表现和效率。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPO在不依赖奖励模型的情况下如何利用偏好数据对大语言模型进行有效对齐，分析偏好数据对DPO性能的关键影响因素。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验证明，研究DPO客观优化中被选响应质量的重要性，并探讨在线DPO环境的简化形式，同时验证不同策略的有效性。

Result: 实验表明提高被选响应的质量始终能够强化性能，而被拒响应质量的影响相对有限。混合的在线数据策略也表现出益处。

Conclusion: 提升被选响应质量是优化DPO性能的核心，研究提出了构建优质偏好数据集的实践建议，并解释了一些广泛采用的策略背后的机制。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于电子健康记录的研究多侧重于单一数据，限制了预测性能和可解释性，需开发一种能全面利用EHR数据多层次结构的框架。

Method: 提出ProtoEHR框架，利用大型语言模型提取医疗代码语义关系并构建医疗知识图，通过层次化表示学习和原型信息，提高预测性能和泛化能力。

Result: 在两个公开数据集的五个临床任务评估中，ProtoEHR表现出较高的准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ProtoEHR可有效提升医疗预测能力，同时提供不同层次的解释性洞察，为健康预测任务提供支持。

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Motivation: 远程教育中学生辍学率高是一个普遍挑战，及时识别高风险学生以提供支持成为必要。

Method: 利用OULAD数据集的学生学术表现和数字参与模式，开发基于Logistic Regression和深度神经网络的机器学习模型，使用联邦学习框架解决数据隐私和机构数据孤岛的难题，并比较模型复杂性和数据平衡。

Result: 最终模型通过联邦学习框架实现，ROC AUC得分约为85%，表现出较强的预测能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种既能保护隐私又具有可扩展性的早期预警系统构建方案，为提升学生支持提供了有效途径。

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放工业环境中风电数据缺失问题及联邦学习的隐私与安全挑战。

Method: 结合多头注意力的序列到序列数据填补模型，将可验证差分隐私与零知识证明及动态信任感知聚合机制整合。

Result: ZTFed-MAS2S在联邦学习性能和数据缺失填补上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为能源行业提供了安全、高效的解决方案，验证了其实用性和优越性。

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HCR（分层相关重建）的新方法，以解决当前HSIC方法在处理大规模数据样本时计算复杂度过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HSIC方法在评估统计依赖性时计算复杂度较高（约为O(n^2.37)），对大规模数据样本不够实用，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: HCR方法利用分层相关的特征，通过线性时间复杂度（O(n)）计算以及使用混合矩的混合描述，提供了实际的联合分布模型，同时还能近似互信息。

Result: HCR方法表现出更高的依赖灵敏度，可以以线性时间计算单个特征，并以O(d^2)或O(d^3)的额外复杂度处理不同维度和相关依赖。

Conclusion: HCR提供了一种计算效率更高的依赖评估方法，同时还能建模数据样本间的联合分布，为处理大规模数据集提供了实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Motivation: 解决专家混合架构中，由于计算规模过大和激活模式不可预测导致的效率和可用性问题。

Method: 通过后训练专家划分，诱导张量级和神经元级稀疏性，同时提出DualSparse-MoE推理系统，结合动态计算缩减与静态神经元重构优化推理性能。

Result: 实验表明，在三种主流MoE模型上，该方法可在约25%的计算减少条件下，仅损失0.08%-0.28%的准确率，同时提供显著的计算加速效果。

Conclusion: 基于后训练的双重稀疏设计显著提升了MoE模型在推理阶段的效率，同时保持了模型的高准确度，这对大语言模型的实际部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

<details>

Motivation: 解决传统强化学习在极度稀疏奖励环境中由于缺乏正反馈而难以学习的问题。

Method: 结合Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR)和基于大语言模型(LLM)的内在奖励策略，并将其应用于Actor-Critic (A2C)代理中。

Result: 相较于单独使用任一策略或标准A2C代理，所提出的组合策略显著提升了代理的性能和采样效率。

Conclusion: 结合方法有效地利用了不同策略的优势，一方面通过VSIMR促进状态探索，另一方面利用LLM生成的奖励信号帮助目标导向的开发。

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在合成函数和实际应用中优于许多其他高维BO技术，并改进了TuRBO的高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法在高维贝叶斯优化中兼顾了异构建模和采样效率，提供了一种更有效的高维优化策略。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: 数据增强不仅能减少模型记忆，还在隐私保护和高效忘记中起到关键作用。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

TL;DR: 变分量子算法（VQAs）通过引入基于强化学习的初始化策略，有效缓解了消减梯度的“贫瘠高原”问题，并显著提升了训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前变分量子算法的应用受“贫瘠高原”问题的限制，需要找到能够避免梯度消失并提升训练效率的新方法。

Method: 通过强化学习算法（如确定性策略梯度、软演员评论家和近端策略优化）生成初始电路参数，优化初始参数状态，帮助后续梯度优化更高效进行。

Result: 在不同噪声条件和任务下的数值实验表明，强化学习初始化策略显著提升了收敛速度和最终解质量，并且多个强化学习算法均表现出较高的灵活性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的参数初始化方法为解决VQA中的“贫瘠高原”问题开辟了一条新的途径，展现了机器学习技术与量子算法设计结合的潜力。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

TL;DR: 提出了Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW)方法，用于动态调整多模态学习中的模态权重，以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在多模态学习中发现，加入额外模态可能带来噪声而非信息增益，现有方法难以扩展到多个模态且缺乏实例级控制的精度。

Method: 提出一种双层级、非参数化权重框架BTW，结合实例级KL散度和模态级互信息动态调整模态重要性，且不需额外参数。

Result: 在情感回归和临床分类实验中显著提升了回归性能和多类分类准确度。

Conclusion: BTW方法可以以非参数化方式提升多模态模型性能，并适用于任意数量模态的情况下。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种结合生成模型的解释框架，连接了化学可解释性与分子设计，为化学中的解释性机器学习提供了生成式和原则性的新路径。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Result: 获得更加泛化和适用性更强的图神经网络分析工具。

Conclusion: 本文修正了此前研究的不足，使MPNN分析更加灵活且适用于实际的图机器学习设置。

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种叫做SPF的框架，用以改善数据驱动方法在预测复杂系统时长期精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决复杂系统中数据驱动方法长期预测误差积累和自回归训练模式的显存消耗问题，目标是提高长期准确性和降低计算资源需求。

Method: 提出了SPF框架，通过模型预测构造补充数据集并结合真实数据，采用随机获取策略，使短期和长期性能达到平衡，且无需存储完整展开的序列，保持内存使用稳定。

Result: 在Burger方程和浅水波动基准测试上的实验表明，与自回归方法相比，SPF框架具有更高的长期精度和更低的内存需求。

Conclusion: SPF框架为资源受限和复杂模拟提供了一个有希望的方法，其平衡了短期与长期性能且在计算资源上的需求较低。

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于稀疏自动编码器（SAE）和蛋白质语言模型（pLMs）的预测方法，用于低数据情况下的蛋白质功能预测和设计，结果表明SAE能有效提升预测准确性和设计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低数据量情况下，如何有效预测蛋白质功能及设计是一个核心问题，而现有方法如蛋白质语言模型（pLMs）在此方面仍有改进空间。本文希望通过稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）改善此问题。

Method: 将稀疏自动编码器应用于经过微调的ESM2嵌入表示上，通过低数据集的健身外推预测及蛋白工程任务来评估性能。

Result: 即使仅采用24条序列，SAEs在预测蛋白质功能时表现显著优于或与ESM2方法相当，并能更有效地从有限数据中泛化。

Conclusion: 稀疏自动编码器提供了简洁且具有生物学意义的潜在空间表示，在低数据预测及蛋白质设计任务中显示出很大的优势。

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Motivation: 目前药物研发复杂且成本高昂，而现有的机器学习方法在药物审批预测效果有限且可解释性不足。研究的动机是开发一个高效且可解释的模型来克服这些挑战。

Method: 研究开发了DrugReasoner模型，该模型基于LLaMA架构，并通过整合分子描述符和与已有已批准与未批准化合物的比较推理来预测药物审批可能性。同时提供逐步推理和置信分数。

Result: 在验证和测试数据集上，DrugReasoner的AUC和F1评分分别为0.732和0.729，以及0.725和0.718，表现优于传统基线模型如逻辑回归、支持向量机等，并在外部独立数据集上优于ChemAP模型，展现出出色的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DrugReasoner不仅在预测准确性上具有竞争力，还通过生成解释性推理输出提高了透明度，展示了推理增强型大语言模型在制药决策中的潜力。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RhymeRL，一种提升大型语言模型（LLM）强化学习（RL）训练效率的系统，通过利用历史生成相似性提升推演和调度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于增强LLM推理能力的RL方法中，因推演阶段占主导且存在任务长度不均，导致GPU利用率低的问题。为解决此类问题需要改进现有RL流程。

Method: 提出两项创新：1) HistoSpec，基于历史推演序列相似性进行推测解码；2) HistoPipe，利用历史分布相似性优化任务分发和调度。

Result: 实验中，RhymeRL展示了从几十到数千GPU的扩展性，与现有方法相比性能提升2.6倍，同时保证了训练准确性。

Conclusion: RhymeRL通过两个优化策略大幅提高了RL训练效率，不改变现有RL范式且不影响准确性，是一项重要的创新。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Conclusion: 混合输入架构和不确定性感知机制的结合在时间序列数据的无监督域适配中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Motivation: 解决城市预测模型中由数据不平衡引发的问题，特别是在数据稀缺城市中的准确性扩大。

Method: 通过引入STRATA-TS框架，采用基于片段的时序编码器识别目标序列并进行语义和动态匹配，结合LLM推理和监督微调提升预测能力。

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥的三个停车可用性数据集上，STRATA-TS 表现出优越的预测性能和可解释知识转移路径。

Conclusion: STRATA-TS在数据稀缺条件下实现了更强的预测能力，同时保证了知识传递的可解释性。

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

Motivation: 现有的机器学习模型在预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应方面缺乏解释性，并且未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构。

Method: 采用了一种名为BDVAE的模型，将转录组学和基因组数据通过特定模态和路径的编码器整合，并利用变分推断学习与生物学过程相关的潜在特征。

Result: 在包含366名癌症患者的泛癌队列上，模型准确预测治疗反应（测试数据AUC-ROC=0.94），并揭示了包括免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经信号在内的关键耐药机制。

Conclusion: BDVAE能够生成具有解释性和临床相关性的见解，为理解癌症耐药机制和指导精准免疫治疗策略提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析受限于财务市场中的信息不对称和战略性企业叙述，难以准确评估市场风险。因此需要结合非文本信号来增强分析能力。

Method: 该研究提出多模态框架，结合文本情感分析和基于物理声学模型（PIAM）的声学情感分析，并通过三维情感状态标签(Tension, Stability, Arousal)解释情感变化，分析企业电话会议中执行官从脚本到问答间情感的动态变化。

Result: 多模态特征可解释30日波动率43.8%的方差。执行官文本稳定性的减弱、声学不稳定性增强和情感唤醒变异是波动率预测的重要驱动因素，特别在脚本到问答的过渡阶段表现显著。

Conclusion: 多模态框架显著优于仅依赖财务数据的基准，验证了情感声学和文本信号的互补价值。该方法为投资者和监管者提供了一种强大工具，以更好地解读市场动态并识别隐藏的不确定性。

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Conclusion: FFT MoE框架成功解决了LoRA在异构FL环境中的局限性，有助于实现更高效的联邦优化。

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现存机器学习消除算法是否可能对保留样本引入隐私风险，并提出一种全面审计框架。

Method: 基于差分隐私和成员推断攻击，构建了隐私审计准则，并开发了一种高效的MIA方法A-LiRA，使用数据增强优化影子模型训练效率。

Result: 现有的近似机器学习消除算法可能对差分隐私模型中保留样本的隐私造成负面影响，需开发新的差分隐私的消除算法。

Conclusion: 需要更加注重保留数据的隐私保障，设计更合适的差分隐私消除算法。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

TL;DR: 本文研究稀疏性对混合专家模型（MoE）的记忆和推理能力的影响，发现稀疏会导致推理性能饱和甚至下降，但对记忆性能有正面促进作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏性对当前流行的混合专家模型能力表现的不同影响，填补密集模型无法涵盖的稀疏维度研究空白。

Method: 通过训练一组具有不同参数、活跃参数和top-k路由的MoE Transformers，在固定计算成本下，记录预训练损失、下游任务损失和任务准确率，分析稀疏性对性能的影响。

Result: 记忆能力随总参数增加而提升，同时训练损失下降；推理能力则会饱和甚至恶化，而改变top-k几乎没有影响。后续调参和测试时间优化无法弥补稀疏模型的劣势。

Conclusion: 稀疏性显著影响模型的记忆和推理性能，需要在模型设计中平衡参数规模与稀疏性。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Motivation: 目前的表格推理方法在微调模型泛化性和无训练提示的训练数据利用率之间存在权衡，而作者希望设计一种方法，以结合二者的优势。

Method: 提出了LRTab方法，通过从训练数据中获取相关信息，在提示过的训练数据上生成连锁思维（CoT）响应，并通过预测提示条件（Prompt Conditions）避免错误，最后在推理阶段检索最相关的提示条件以提供上下文信息。

Result: LRTab方法在WikiTQ和Tabfact两个表格推理数据集上，展现出其可解释性、高效性，并且超越了之前的各类基线模型性能。

Conclusion: LRTab通过结合提示式推理和训练数据的利用，既具备高效的泛化能力又能提升性能，证明了其在表格推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于早期脓毒症检测的端到端深度学习框架，优于传统机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要解决传统机器学习方法在检测脓毒症中特征工程依赖强且应对不规则和缺失时间序列数据能力弱的问题。

Method: 使用无监督自编码器自动提取特征，并通过多层感知机分类器进行二分类预测，同时采用下采样策略和动态滑动窗口机制以增强临床适用性。

Result: 验证于三个ICU数据集，模型准确率分别为74.6%、80.6%和93.5%，均优于传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习框架在早期脓毒症检测中具有更高的鲁棒性、泛化性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决如何通过压缩高维特征实现高效分类，同时保持准确性的问题。

Method: 将高维特征向量解释为稀疏图上的自旋系统（RBIM），在Nishimori温度下操作。同时结合拓扑结构设计新型图结构来压缩特征，并使用快速算法确定关键参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-10和-100上分别达到98.7%和82.7%的准确率，压缩效果显著（参数减少40倍）。

Conclusion: 物理启发的拓扑指导图设计能够保留高效嵌入性能，同时显著减少参数量，展现了极具潜力的分类性能。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了结构感知的图自监督学习框架StructRTL，以改进寄存器传输级(RTL)设计质量估计，并通过实验验证方法优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型对RTL代码进行质量估计的方法忽略了结构语义特征，且准确性有待提高。

Method: 提出StructRTL框架，从控制数据流图(CDFG)中学习结构感知表示，并结合知识蒸馏策略，将后映射网表的底层见解迁移到CDFG预测器中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个质量估计任务上显著优于现有技术，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 结合结构化学习与跨阶段监督的方法能够有效提升RTL设计质量估计的准确性，引领领域性能进一步突破。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种名为FLAegis的防御框架，为联邦学习（FL）应对拜占庭攻击提供了新的解决方案，通过时序符号化和谱聚类提高鲁棒性和识别精度，并结合FFT聚合函数进一步增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对联邦学习中因拜占庭客户端引发的模型更新中毒攻击问题，以增强FL系统的鲁棒性与安全性。

Method: 提出两阶段防御框架FLAegis：第一阶段利用符号时间序列转换（SAX）放大正常与恶意模型间的差异并通过谱聚类识别对抗行为；第二阶段加入基于FFT的聚合函数，降低未识别拜占庭客户端的影响。

Result: 在五种中毒攻击场景下评估，同时在检测精度与最终模型准确率方面均超越现有技术，即使面对强对抗条件仍保持较高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架显著提升了联邦学习系统的安全性和鲁棒性，能够高效识别和缓解拜占庭攻击的影响，且优于当下的防御方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文探索了在离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习中，如何通过Bellman残差最小化（BRM）方法提高一致性，并提出了单一的Lyapunov势分析工具，证明了O(1/n)的稳定性与过度风险边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习和逆强化学习的目标是在固定数据批次下恢复接近最优的值函数或奖励模型，但目前方法很难保证Bellman一致性。BRM作为一种潜在的解决方案，其统计行为在离线环境中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 本文引入了一种单一Lyapunov势分析法，通过邻近数据集的SGDA运行进行一致性分析，从而获得稳定性边界和过度风险的更优估计。

Result: 结果显示，在不依赖于方差降低、额外正则化或严格的独立采样假设的情况下，标准的神经网络参数化和小批量SGD的BRM方法实现了O(1/n)的稳定性与过度风险边界。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对BRM在离线设置中统计行为的理解，为利用SGDA方法解决Bellman残差最小化问题奠定了理论基础，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数模型简化方法仅集中在变量简化上，却忽视了从对偶视角出发的约束简化需求，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过标记最优解的紧约束作为关键约束，结合启发式方法选择部分紧约束，提出了一种多模态表示技术以高效预测关键约束。

Conclusion: 基于约束的模型简化方法有效提升了MILP问题的求解效率和结果质量，具有显著的应用价值。

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为UltraMemV2的改进记忆层架构，该方法通过多个改进达到了与8-expert MoE模型的性能平价，同时显著降低了内存访问需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mixture of Experts (MoE)模型在推理阶段存在高内存访问成本的问题，而基于记忆层的架构虽然内存访问较少，但性能有限，难以匹敌高端MoE模型。

Method: 推出UltraMemV2，通过五大改进（如将记忆层整合至每个Transformer块、简化值扩展、引入FFN值处理、参数初始化优化、重新平衡计算比率）提升性能，并广泛评测其表现。

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数下达到了与8-expert MoE模型的性能平价，在记忆密集型任务中表现突出，如长上下文记忆提升1.6分，多轮记忆提升6.2分，在上下文学习中提升7.9分。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2成功将记忆层架构性能提升至与MoE模型持平，并显著减少内存访问开销，是稀疏计算领域的有力替代方案。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Governance-as-a-Service（GaaS）的方法，用于在不改变AI模型内部结构且不依赖代理合作的情况下，实施政策驱动的运行时监督。通过三种仿真实验验证，其能有效阻止高风险行为，同时动态调节信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统发展成为分布式生态系统，缺乏可扩展的去耦合治理构成了结构性风险。现有监督机制反应滞后、不灵活，且与代理架构绑定，不易审计，也难以在异质部署中泛化。

Method: 通过引入GaaS，一种模块化的政策驱动执行层，利用声明式规则和信任因子的机制，在运行时对代理行为进行监管，同时支持强制性、规范性和自适应的干预措施。

Result: 仿真实验证实GaaS能够可靠地拦截或重定向高风险行为，同时保留系统吞吐量，信任评分能够跟踪规则遵守情况并隔离不可信组件。

Conclusion: GaaS通过将治理定位为类似计算或存储的运行时服务，建立了可互操作的代理生态系统的基础设施级对齐。这并非教会代理伦理，而是强制实施伦理。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

Motivation: 探讨在联邦学习中，客户由于私有标签集导致的异质性对模型性能的影响，为提高隐私保护下的学习模型性能提供解决方案。

Method: 将分类器组合问题的方法应用于联邦学习，结合集中调优的方式实现表示对齐，同时开发了用于私有标签集场景的联邦学习方法。

Result: 标签集数量减少会显著影响模型性能，但集中调优可一定程度上解决此问题。研究显示适应后的方法在私有标签场景中表现良好，与公有标签场景下的标准方法性能相近。

Conclusion: 提出的适应方法可在增强隐私保护的同时，保持模型性能不显著下降，展现了联邦学习在隐私数据上的潜力。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Motivation: 传统对偶强盗算法难以捕获用户在消费后提供的更可靠的反馈。

Method: 提出一种通过推荐单个项目并使用用户历史消费数据进行比较查询的新模型，并采用矩阵集中界证明其算法性能。

Result: 证明短暂随机探索阶段足以建立丰富的用户历史，从而获得$O(\sqrt{T})$的遗憾保证，同时仿真分析表明此方法比传统同时推荐比较方式有效。

Conclusion: 该新模型展示了通过重新利用历史项目进行比较，能够显著降低推荐系统的遗憾值，具有实际意义。

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Conclusion: C-Flat作为一种易于集成且有效的方法，显著提升了持续学习的性能，并通过C-Flat++进一步提高了效率。

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多依赖静态或一阶因果结构，忽略了因果关系的多阶和时间变化特性，因而难以处理复杂事件序列中的因果依赖。

Method: 引入多阶因果路径的潜在时间变化图模型，设计了时间变化的有向无环图（DAG）并联合建模因果发现与TPP动态，确保结构有效性与可解释性。

Result: 在真实数据集上MOCHA实现了最先进的事件预测性能，同时揭示了有意义且可解释的因果结构。

Conclusion: MOCHA为发现TPPs中的多阶动态因果关系提供了新的解决方案，在事件预测和因果解释方面表现出色。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

TL;DR: 提出了HAEPO算法以增强在长时间任务中的探索能力，通过全轨迹历史的信息优化和稳定策略，超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长时间任务中的探索能力受到限制，需要更好的策略优化方法。

Method: 提出了一种全新的方法（HAEPO），将轨迹的对数概率累积并使用Plackett-Luce软最大化归一化权重，同时加入熵正则化和软KL惩罚机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，HAEPO表现出快速收敛、充分探索以及较高的学习稳定性，在多个任务中优于或与现有方法持平。

Conclusion: HAEPO结合了轨迹历史信息，实现了探索与稳定性之间的平衡，为长时间任务提供了有效且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

Motivation: 解决标准神经过程在不确定性校准及局部数据依赖捕捉方面的局限性。

Method: DNP采用全球潜变量捕捉任务级变化，并引入局部潜变量以通过距离空间保存输入相似性，结合bi-Lipschitz正则化确保输入关系的保真。

Result: DNP在回归和分类任务中实现了较高的预测性能和不确定性校准，能更有效地区分内外分布数据。

Conclusion: DNP通过全球和局部潜变量结合的创新方法改进了传统神经过程，增强了其不确定性估计能力并提高了任务表现。

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 首次推导出具有非线性动态行为神经ODE的泛化误差边界，为理解此类模型的泛化能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across

ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty
quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption
datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and
superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

Conclusion: 尽管现有模型在标签协方差测量上均存在局限性，但多元Probit模型在错误率上表现较优，有助于更准确地处理多标签数据分析中的协方差测量问题。

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测模型缺乏可解释性，且现有的后验解释方法（如LIME）不适用于时间序列预测。需要一种新的方法来分析和解释预测模型，尤其是其在跨通道相关性和多层次细节上的表现。

Method: 提出PAX-TS算法，通过基于局部输入扰动生成多层次解释，并能表征多变量时间序列预测中的跨通道相关性。

Result: 实验表明，PAX-TS对高性能与低性能算法的解释有显著不同，揭示了模型行为。作者还发现了6类跨数据集和算法的重复模式，这些模式与预测误差呈现差异。

Conclusion: PAX-TS通过提供多层次的细节，增强了模型解释性，能够分析跨通道相关性，在实际问题中的预测解释具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

### [241] [STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19011)
*Gary Simethy,Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo,Petar Durdevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法STDiff，通过条件去噪扩散模型处理时间序列缺失值，尤其适用于工业系统中的长时段缺失情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的深度学习方法在处理缺失值填补时假定数据在固定时间窗口内连续，但这种假设在具有非平稳特性和控制驱动的工业系统中并不适用。

Method: STDiff采用条件去噪扩散模型，结合控制理论的因果偏置，根据最近的已知状态和相关输入逐步生成缺失值。

Result: 在公共污水处理数据集上，STDiff在模拟的长时段缺失情况下表现出最低误差；在实际工业数据集中，其生成结果保持动态合理性，优于窗口式方法。

Conclusion: STDiff是一种面向动态且显式条件化的时间序列填补方法，适用于工业场景，同时本文讨论了计算成本权衡及其更广泛的应用扩展。

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Motivation: 通过物理角度研究学习过程，以一个简单动态系统解释学习与物理定律的关系。

Method: 设计一个用棍棒逼近平滑函数、弹簧势能表达误差函数，并通过耗散过程收敛到最小能量态的动力系统模型。

Result: 该动力系统通过回归测试，其表现可与多层感知机媲美，同时发现系统的自由能变化与学习能力相关，存在热力学学习屏障影响学习行为。

Conclusion: 该模型为从物理视角理解学习系统提供了新方向，揭示了环境波动对学习能力的影响。

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合资源视角的下一个活动预测方法，通过比较模型和编码策略，发现特定组合在准确性方面表现优异，促进更智能的资源分配及工作规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPM框架主要依赖于控制流视角，而忽略了资源视角在预测中的潜力。本研究旨在填补这一空白，研究资源信息是否可以增强对未来活动预测的准确性。

Method: 评估了四种预测模型（包括LightGBM和Transformer）及三种编码策略，通过对四个真实数据集的实验，分析其准确性表现。

Result: 1. LightGBM和Transformer在基于2-gram活动转移编码上表现最佳。
2. 随机森林在结合2-gram转移和活动重复特征的编码上表现更好。
3. 组合编码实现了最高的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 资源驱动的下一个活动预测可以促进更高效的资源分配、战略性员工规划及个性化员工支持，同时揭示了PPM研究的新方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型因过拟合导致的预测性能下降问题，尤其是在数据有限的场景中。

Method: 通过梯度信息估计Bayesian后验分布，以此定义早停止问题，并利用近似后验分布得到停止准则。

Result: 实验证明，GradStop在测试数据上具有较低的损失，相比基于验证集的方法更具优势。

Conclusion: 该方法无需持出验证集，充分利用全部训练数据，适用于数据受限场景，并能以较低计算开销集成于梯度下降库。

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

Motivation: 探索现代循环深度学习模型与Transformers在复杂推理和记忆任务（如关联回忆任务）中表现和训练问题的根本原因。

Method: 通过实验分析，对比循环模型与基于注意力的Transformer模型在学习率、宽度与深度扩展方面的行为，同时对Transformer的单层与多层结构进行分析，研究训练动态及结构组件的影响。

Result: 发现学习率对循环模型影响显著；循环模型与注意力模型在扩展策略上的表现和优势截然不同；单层Transformer尽管表现较差，但训练动态显示类似诱导头形成的现象；通过消融实验对架构优化稳定性进行了研究。

Conclusion: 循环模型和Transformer在复杂任务中各有优劣，对训练动态和架构组件的深入理解有助于未来改进相关模型的设计和性能。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种透明的机器学习架构，用于改进地震动模型（GMMs），解决传统黑箱问题和数据不平衡导致的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习虽然能有效开发GMMs，但因缺乏透明性及数据不平衡问题限制了其应用，特别是在高风险决策中。

Method: 采用HazBinLoss函数，逐项计算输入变量线性贡献的ML架构，使模型更透明，同时给关键的近场大震记录赋予较高权重，减少预测误差。

Result: 模型捕获了已知地震学原理，性能与现有模型相当，且实现了透明化。

Conclusion: 该透明架构使ML方法在风险评估和灾害规划中更具应用潜力，为地震动预测提供了新方向。

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前GNNs的外推能力（如处理更大或结构不同的图）尚不明确，而本研究希望证明GNNs不仅可以近似模拟，还可以推动数值方法的发展。

Method: 在小规模图数据集上训练GNN，使用符号回归解析其结果，并采用PINN残差损失进行无监督训练，探索GNN生成高阶数值方案的能力。

Result: GNN可以推断一阶有限体积（FV）方案，并结合符号回归重现其解析公式。在无监督设定下，GNN也能发现原理方案，并进一步发展到二阶校正方案。

Conclusion: GNN不仅能近似解决数值问题，更能作为开发新数值方法的活跃工具，展示了其在科学计算领域的广泛潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规要求深度学习模型中删除指定数据，联邦学习中该任务因数据存储于客户端难以协调更新而更为复杂，需求紧迫。

Method: 利用信息论将泄露建模为参数估计问题，通过二阶Hessian信息识别敏感参数，只对其重置，同时结合最小化再训练实现联邦学习中的高效数据遗忘。

Result: 在测试集上的隐私指标（如攻击成功率接近随机）、性能指标（如接近重新训练的0.9标准化准确率）表现优异，并在特定的对抗攻击中有效移除恶意触发器。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为联邦学习中的数据遗忘提供了实用方案，在保障隐私和性能的基础上明显提高了效率。

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Conclusion: TRIGON框架有效缓解了GNN固有的拓扑局限性，为图学习任务提供了性能更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Result: APT-LLM在RTX 3090上比FP16提升3.99倍，比NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4提升2.16倍；在RTX 4090和H800上分别比FP16和CUTLASS基线提升2.44倍和1.65倍。

Conclusion: APT-LLM显著提高了任意精度大语言模型的推理性能，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Motivation: 当前扩散模型生成样本质量的提升主要依赖于对齐（与奖励对齐）和组合（多模型结合）方法，但这些方法存在难以同时满足多种属性的缺点。

Method: 采用基于约束优化的框架，通过拉格朗日原对偶训练算法，统一实现对齐与组合，并理论探讨了其解决方案。

Result: 作者在图像生成任务中验证了该方法的有效性，与传统方法相比，更能满足用户约束。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够有效统一对齐与组合，生成样本更符合用户需求并优于平均加权方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Conclusion: 该框架在整合多源反馈和优化反馈利用方面表现良好，能够在多个环境下提升学习效率。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

Conclusion: 本文通过理论与实验结合，验证了DAM模型在监督和非监督分类任务中的可解释性及有效性，同时优化了训练性能。

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

### [255] [Emotions as Ambiguity-aware Ordinal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19193)
*Jingyao Wu,Matthew Barthet,David Melhart,Georgios N. Yannakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的模糊感知序数情感表示框架，能够捕捉情感标注中的模糊性及情感轨迹的时间动态特性，并在两种情感语料上验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感识别方法要么忽略了情感的模糊性，要么将其当作独立、静态变量处理，然而情感本质上是动态且模糊的，缺乏有效处理该特点的方法。

Method: 提出了一种通过其变化率来建模情感模糊性的框架，并在两个情感语料库（RECOLA和GameVibe）上测试了这一方法，分为有界（唤醒度、愉悦度）和无界（参与度）情感轨迹的实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，序数情感表示在无界标签上超越了传统的模糊模型，达到了最高的协同相关系数（CCC）和签名差异一致性（SDA）分数；在有界标签上，序数表示在SDA指标上表现更优，显示出其捕捉相对情感变化的能力。

Conclusion: 序数情感表示在处理情感动态变化方面具有显著优势，尤其在捕捉模糊性及轨迹动态特性上表现出色。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

*Heng Lin,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过形式化方法证明了利用工具的推理（TIR）如何扩展LLM的能力，并提出了一种新的算法ASPO来优化这一过程。实验结果显示，结合工具的模型在处理数学任务时表现显著优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然与工具结合的LLMs表现出了强大的能力，但关于为何这种方法有效的理论阐释尚属空白。该研究希望通过理论证明工具如何扩展LLMs的能力，并优化其性能。

Method: 提出并证明了工具通过扩展LLMs的问题解决能力，从而突破其纯文本模型的能力上限。同时引入了一种新的算法ASPO，通过修改优势函数来引导模型的策略行为，并在数学基准任务上验证了其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，TIR模型在数学基准任务中显著超越了纯文本模型，不仅在需要计算能力的问题上取得进展，也在需要复杂抽象思维的问题上表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文首次提供了TIR成功的理论解释，证明工具不仅有效，而且揭示了其如何以及为何提升模型的推理能力，进一步优化了工具的使用行为。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

*Zayd M. K. Zuhri,Erland Hilman Fuadi,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的辅助目标任务 Token Order Prediction (TOP)，通过学习排序的损失函数对语言模型进行预训练，在多项NLP基准测试中超越了传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标记预测（MTP）作为辅助目标提升单标记预测（NTP）能力，但表现不一致，提升有限。

Method: 提出TOP任务，使用学习排序的损失函数，要求模型根据邻近性对未看到的标记排序，仅需额外的单个解嵌层。

Result: 预训练了340M、1.8B、7B参数的模型，在8个NLP基准中TOP整体优于NTP和MTP。

Conclusion: TOP在标记预测任务中证明了一种有效且简化的辅助目标设计，有助于提升语言模型性能，尤其在大规模场景中表现优越。

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对电磁信号的基础模型EMind，解决了当前领域内异质性、高噪声和缺少大规模高质量数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号在动态频谱管理、智能交通等领域应用广泛，但因其异质性和复杂性无法直接使用传统方法处理。

Method: 创建了首个覆盖多种信号类型和任务的统一数据集，通过物理特性设计长度自适应信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，提高异质多源信号的利用效率。

Conclusion: EMind 模型及其方法推动了电磁信号智能处理的进步，为该领域的通用多任务学习框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本篇论文提出了一种协作框架用于分割DWI序列中缺血性中风病灶，利用深度学习技术中独立于中心的表示，通过联邦平均（FedAvg）模型在多中心环境中展现优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺血性中风是全球第二大致死原因，第三大致残原因。目前基于DWI成像对病灶进行定位、表征及体积测量是临床标准。但由于患者群体差异、设备厂商品牌及专家标注不同，病灶分析结果存在较大差异。此外，很多临床中心缺乏足够标注样本以适应现有解决方案。

Method: 利用14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究样本，开发协作框架并采用联邦平均（FedAvg）模型，从深度学习中心无关表征中共享知识，以支持对中风病灶的分割任务。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心的表现优于集中式解决方案和其他联邦式规则，取得了DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60及LF1 0.70±0.26的平均结果。在跨分布性中心中也展现了出色的泛化性（DSC 0.64±0.29，AVD 4.44±8.74）。

Conclusion: 本研究表明协作框架可有效实现多中心条件下高可靠性缺血性中风病灶分割，并具有良好的泛化能力，展示了帮助临床实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在RAW域中恢复高保真图片的扩散模型，解决了传统sRGB方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型存在因使用有损的sRGB输入和忽略RAW数据而性能受限的困境。

Method: 提出了RAW域VAE学习，差分后调处理模块，同时开发数据降解管线与可配置的多Bayer模式LoRA模块。

Result: RDDM在与现有的sRGB扩散方法比较中结果更优，表现出更高的图像保真度和更少的伪影。

Conclusion: RDDM突破sRGB局限，直接操作RAW数据，改进了图片恢复质量。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.
