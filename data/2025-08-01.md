### [1] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于尖峰神经网络(SNN)的动态时间步长NeRF框架PATA，通过减少推理时间步长64%和运行功耗61.55%，在不损失渲染质量的情况下提升了效能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF模型在3D重建和渲染表现优秀，但高浮点运算需求限制了其在边缘计算等资源受限场景的应用；尖峰神经网络（SNN）因其高能效成为解决方案的基础。

Method: 提出了PATA方法，核心为预训练和动态时间步长调整策略，可在训练时权衡渲染质量及时间步长，推断时实现适应场景的时间步调整，从而降低计算资源需求。

Result: 在Instant-NGP架构基础上评估，实验表明，PATA能在减少64%推理时间步长的同时保留渲染质量，并降低运行功耗61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA方法在渲染质量与效率之间取得平衡，为资源受限场景下的动态时间步长NeRF建模提供了高能效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark, EGE-Math Solutions Assessment
Benchmark, for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on their ability to

solutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed
criteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam
(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from
Google, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes. The
results reveal current limitations in mathematical reasoning and human-rubric
alignment, opening new research avenues in AI-assisted assessment. You can find

### [3] [Robust and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23006)
*Zhensheng Yuan,Haozhi Huang,Zhen Xiong,Di Wang,Guanghua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，实现在不同视图捕获场景中，快速重建和实时渲染大规模城市场景，具备高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角捕获场景中因外观变化导致的重建效率低和视觉一致性问题。

Method: 使用场景分区、显著性图像选择策略进行平行化训练，同时引入LOD策略控制渲染细节层次，与外观转换模块等增强模块提高训练效率和视觉质量。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法可有效重建城市规模场景，在训练效率和视觉质量上优于之前的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了快速高效的大规模城市场景建模解决方案，同时官方代码已开源提供验证。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [4] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ScanDiff的新模型，通过结合扩散模型和视觉变换器，来预测具有多样性和真实性的人类注视路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在注视路径预测上虽然有所进展，但生成的行为通常为平均化的，无法体现人类视觉探索的多样性。

Method: 提出了ScanDiff架构，将扩散模型的随机性与视觉变换器结合以生成多元化的注视路径，并引入文本条件作为控制，使模型能够适应不同视觉搜索任务。

Result: 实验表明，ScanDiff在自由观察和任务驱动场景中优于现有方法，生成的注视路径更具多样性和准确性。

Conclusion: ScanDiff展示了捕捉人类视觉行为复杂性的能力，对注视路径预测研究具有推动作用，同时公开了源码和模型供研究者使用。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [5] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用深度学习的超分辨率技术改进低质量心脏超声图像分类效果，验证了该技术可恢复诊断价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中，由于心脏超声图像质量差，影响了诊断模型的效果，亟需提高图像质量的方法。

Method: 采用公开的CAMUS数据集，分图像质量分层评估任务，并应用SRGAN和SRResNet两种超分辨率模型提升低质量图像，重点对2CH与4CH图分类及ED与ES时相分类任务进行分析。

Result: SR技术，尤其是SRResNet模型在性能和计算效率方面表现显著提升，能有效改进低质量图像的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明超分辨率技术可以恢复退化的超声图的诊断价值，为资源受限的AI辅助医疗提供了可行工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种处理多模态输入（图像、HD地图、LiDAR深度和文本路径点）的单分支视觉语言架构，优化了自动驾驶车辆的实时推理和路径效率，同时降低了碰撞率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆需要在复杂路况中通过快速和准确的推理作出实时反应，但现有方法在效率、安全性和灵活性上仍有较大优化空间。

Method: 提出NovaDrive架构，使用单一的视觉语言分支处理多源输入，采用轻量级双阶段交叉注意力块对齐路径点和多模态数据，并引入新的平滑损失函数以减少转向及速度的剧烈变化。同时微调11B规模的视觉语言模型以实现实时推理。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo数据集的测试中，NovaDrive将成功率提升至84%，路径效率提高至0.66，碰撞频率从2.6%降至1.2%，在多个指标上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: NovaDrive不仅提高了自动驾驶的安全性和效率，其架构还能适应更广阔的人机交互领域，同时新方法的短路径特性也能有效减少能源消耗。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种新的合成数据生成方法，即MObI和AnydoorMed，用于无人驾驶和医疗图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全关键性应用（如无人驾驶和医疗图像分析）需要大量高质量的多模态数据，而收集真实世界数据成本高且复杂。

Method: MObI方法通过扩散模型生成逼真且可控的物体擦除和插入，适用于相机和激光雷达数据；AnydoorMed方法则通过扩散模型在医疗成像领域实现基于参考引导的图像修复，保留细节并实现语义一致性。

Result: MObI能够在给定的3D位置进行多模态一致的物体插入，而AnydoorMed可在乳腺癌扫描数据中修复并伪造具有结构完整性的异常区域。

Conclusion: 这两种方法表明，针对自然图像的基础模型可以拓展到其他感知模式，为下一代高度逼真、可控和多模态的反事实场景构建奠定基础。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一种单一视觉语言模型，能够通过融合处理几何和语义信息，实现准确和透明的自动驾驶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决当前自动驾驶系统中几何准确性与语义理解被独立处理的问题，通过统一的模型实现更高效的驾驶能力。

Method: 提出XYZ-Drive模型，将摄像头图像、俯视地图和航点输入到轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层和部分微调的LLaMA-3.2中，输出转向速度及文字解释。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准上达到95%成功率和0.80 SPL，性能比PhysNav-DG高15%，并显著降低碰撞率。同时通过删除各种模块进行消融实验，以验证模型设计的效果。

Conclusion: 通过早期的token级融合实现意图与地图布局的统一处理，使自动驾驶具备实时性、准确性及解释性。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无训练方法E-FineR，能在细粒度视觉识别中达到先进水平，且实现更广泛的解释性与灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细粒度图像分类中的固定词汇表和封闭集分类模式的局限性，同时提升大语言模型(LLMs)在分类阶段的利用率。

Method: 提出了无需训练的E-FineR方法，结合LLMs和视觉语言模型(VLMs)，实现无需预定义类标签的开放集识别。

Result: E-FineR在零样本和小样本分类任务中表现与现有最先进方法相当，同时无需训练和人为干预，实现了强大性能与可解释性。

Conclusion: E-FineR提供了一种灵活的、语言驱动的理解模式，促进了图像分类从固定标签预测向可扩展和通用系统的转变，适用于真实世界应用。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的解决方案，用于开放词汇的3D实例分割，结合并优化了现有方法，在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上表现优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合不同概念，提升开放词汇3D实例分割的性能，解决现有方法的局限性。

Method: 基于两阶段方案：首先通过3D跟踪生成实例提案并优化；然后使用改进版Alpha-CLIP进行分类，同时引入标准化最大相似度评分提升精确度。

Result: 提出的框架在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上各项AP和AR指标表现优越，甚至超越闭合词汇方法。

Conclusion: 通过精细设计的方法整合和改进，一种针对开放词汇3D实例分割的高性能框架得以实现，同时验证了其实验效果的优越性。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为X-NeMo的新型零样本扩散式头像动画方法，可通过驾驶视频中的面部运动驱动静态头像动画。用1D身份无关的潜在运动描述符控制运动并解决身份泄露及表情捕捉的挑战，表现超过现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中身份泄露和难以捕捉微妙与极端表情的主要问题。

Method: 引入端到端训练框架生成1D身份无关的潜在运动描述符，通过交叉注意力控制图像生成中的运动。采用双GAN解码器和增强技术增强表达能力并分离运动和身份特征。

Result: 实验显示，X-NeMo在表达性和身份保持方面超越现有技术，生成高质量头像动画。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法在身份保持和表情细节捕捉方面效果显著，开源代码和模型为后续研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种神经逆向渲染方法，无需光线校准或中间线索即可从多视图图像中同时重建几何、反射率和光照条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多视图光度立体方法需要光线校准或中间法线图等问题，提高复杂几何和反射率场景的重建能力。

Method: 通过神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，并应用阴影感知体积渲染技术，方法包括空间网络预测场景点距离签名及反射率潜码，反射网络根据潜码和方向编码的表面法线等计算反射率值。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度方面超越现有基于法线引导的方法，并能处理对齐视图的多光源图像以及具有挑战性几何和反射率的对象。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下实现了更加精确的重建，是一种无需光线校准的有效神经逆向渲染方法。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单幅图像雨条纹去除问题面临的保护细节与提升视觉质量的双重挑战。

Method: 引入Corner Loss防止边界和细节信息丢失，同时在编码器和解码器中引入残差卷积通道注意力模块（R-CBAM），增强对雨条纹影响区域的关注。

Result: 在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上的去雨性能显著优于现有方法，分别取得了PSNR为33.29 dB和26.16 dB的结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效去除雨条纹，同时保持图像的结构细节和视觉质量，为单幅图像去雨任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

### [17] [Adversarial-Guided Diffusion for Multimodal LLM Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23202)
*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Adversarial-Guided Diffusion（AGD）的新方法，用于生成对抗性图像以欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过生成对抗性图像在避免显著失真情况下影响MLLMs输出响应，具有理论和实际价值。

Method: 引入对抗指导噪声，将目标语义嵌入扩散模型的反向扩散噪声中，从而生成包含全频谱对抗信号的图像，增强防御鲁棒性。

Result: AGD在对抗攻击性能及对一些防御方法的鲁棒性上优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: AGD方法展示了在生成对抗性图像攻击MLLMs方面的效能，其创新设计使得在面对防御时依然保持良好性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

### [18] [Confidence-aware agglomeration classification and segmentation of 2D microscopic food crystal images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23206)
*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文研究了在食品晶体团聚现象中的分类和分割问题，并设计了一种方法结合多个模型的优势，解决手动标注的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究食品中的晶体团聚现象，因为其会影响食品质量，而手动标注图像困难重重；需要开发一种精确的方法替代人工。

Method: 提出了一种监督基线模型生成伪标记用于粗标注数据分类训练；同时训练一种结合了实例分类和像素分割的模型，并在推理阶段结合两者各自优势。设计后处理模块以保留晶体属性。

Result: 提出的方法相比现有方法提高了分类准确性和晶体尺寸分布预测的精度，还在不同手动标注置信水平下实现了潜在团聚实例分类。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了手工标注挑战，提高了食品晶体团聚分类和预测的精度，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

*Zicheng Lin,Weichao Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO-ROC, 一个轻量化、高精度模型，通过增强多尺度特征提取能力及减少计算复杂性，提升道路损坏检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前深度学习在道路损坏检测中存在多尺度特性提取不足和模型参数量大的问题，限制实际应用中的性能和实时性。

Method: 设计了一个BMS-SPPF模块来提高小目标检测的多尺度特征提取能力，并引入层次化通道压缩策略以降低计算复杂性。

Result: 在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上取得了67.6%的mAP50，模型参数减少至0.89M，GFLOPs降低到2.6，模型体积为2.0 MB，小目标D40类的mAP50提高了16.8%。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC提高了道路损坏检测的精度，尤其是小目标检测能力，同时实现了模型轻量化，具有良好的实用性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可扩展、人类对齐的框架以保障AR体验，并期待在感知建模、多模态内容实现和轻量化模型适配方面得到反馈。

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究一种新的增量学习方法，即广义半监督少样本增量学习（GSemi-FSCIL），通过引入ALDC策略解决数据分布偏差问题，实现了最新的性能进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督少样本增量学习仅考虑当次新类的无标签数据，与实际场景不符，因此提出广义方法，利用所有曾见类别数据，更符合现实需求。

Method: 提出了歧义引导的可学习分布校准（ALDC）策略，利用丰富的基类样本动态修正少样本新类的特征分布偏差。

Result: 通过实验验证，ALDC策略在三个基准数据集上均表现优于现有方法，创造了最新的性能记录。

Conclusion: 文章拓宽了少样本增量学习的研究方向，提出的新策略有效应对了更复杂的实际场景，同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为RL-QR的强化学习框架，用于针对检索器进行特定的查询重写，能够在没有人工标注数据的情况下提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的RAG系统查询效果受限，尤其在处理多样化、非结构化的文档时，查询优化仍然具有挑战性。本文旨在提供无需人工标注的有效优化方法。

Method: 通过合成场景-问题对，并利用广义奖励策略优化（GRPO），训练适配于特定检索器的查询重写器，适用于文本及多模态数据库。

Result: 在工业内数据上，RL-QR多模态框架实现了NDCG@3的11%相对提升，针对词汇检索器实现了9%增益。但在语义及混合检索器中表现欠佳，可能源于训练不匹配问题。

Conclusion: RL-QR展示了面向RAG系统的查询优化潜力，提供了具备可扩展性、无需标注的解决方案，但仍需在语义检索领域进一步探索与完善。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服由每对颅神经独特的解剖结构和颅底复杂环境带来的难题，开发一个综合的扩散束流图谱自动化处理方法。

Method: 通过多阶段纤维聚类策略，分析50名来自人体连接组项目(HCP)数据中的约100万条束流，来生成CN图谱，并验证其空间匹配性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，提出的CN图谱在多个数据集上与专家手动注释高度匹配，能够自动识别5对颅神经相关的8个纤维束，并在临床病例中具备鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究在扩散成像领域具有重要意义，可更有效地自动化映射多对颅神经通路，增进对复杂脑结构的分析与理解。

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

### [25] [Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253)
*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TGSI的时间序列几何结构指数评价指标，以解决传统数值指标无法评估时间序列几何结构的问题，同时设计了名为SATL的训练损失函数来增强模型对结构的建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列评估主要依赖传统指标如MSE，其只针对点的精度，难以评估时间序列数据的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间序列的动态特性十分重要。

Method: 本文提出TGSI指标，通过将时间序列转化为图像以利用其二维几何表示。此外，为弥补TGSI无法作为训练损失的不足，设计了多组件的SATL损失函数，具体包括一阶差分损失、频域损失以及感知特征损失来加强结构建模。

Result: 与现有基线方法相比，使用SATL训练的模型在传统MSE指标与新提出的TGSI指标上均表现优越，并且推理阶段没有额外的计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出了新颖的TGSI评价指标及支持其应用的SATL损失函数，为时间序列建模提供了有效的结构评估与优化途径。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多标签图像识别方法，称为Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL)，通过动态学习类别特定的阈值，改进了使用部分标签的多标签识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在未知标签的伪标签生成上表现不佳，原因在于忽略了不同类别的分布变化，伪标签不够准确完整，影响模型性能。

Method: 引入Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL)算法，根据正负样本的分布动态计算类别特定阈值，结合差异化排序损失优化分布区分性。

Result: 在多个大型多标签数据集（如Microsoft COCO和VG-200）上的实验表明，该方法在部分标签场景下显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 动态更新的类别特定阈值和分布优化机制有效提升了多标签图像识别在有限标签条件下的表现，有应用推广潜力。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的模型PixelNerd，用于图像生成任务，通过利用神经场的高效表示，避免了传统方法中的错误积累和解码伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖于预训练的VAE生成压缩潜在空间，但这种两阶段训练方式会引入误差积累和伪影问题。

Method: 提出一种单尺度、单阶段、端到端的PixelNerd模型，利用神经场进行补丁式解码，同时避免了复杂的级联流水线。

Result: 在ImageNet $256\times256$和$512\times512$上分别实现了2.15和2.84的FID分数；在文本到图像生成任务中，PixNerd-XXL/16在GenEval和DPG基准测试中分别达到了0.73和80.9的得分。

Conclusion: PixelNerd是一种高效且创新的方法，它简化了传统的扩散模型流程，同时在多个基准测试中展现了强大的性能。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

TL;DR: 研究评估了通用模型SAM2在乳腺MRI中通过单次注释实现低成本、最小化输入的3D肿瘤分割能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前乳腺MRI的3D肿瘤评估费时费力，且商业化AI工具在资源有限国家应用受限，因此需要开发便宜、简易的分割方法。

Method: 使用SAM2模型，通过单个切片上的注释框，采用三种策略在MRI体积数据中传播分割结果，并评估其表现。

Result: 研究发现基于中心向外传播策略性能最佳。尽管SAM2没有针对医学数据训练，但在最小监督下仍表现出良好的分割效果。

Conclusion: SAM2等通用基础模型在资源有限的环境中可以作为一种低成本的医学影像分析工具。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了iLRM方法，以高效和可扩展的方式进行3D高斯表征的快速重建，有效解决了多视图全注意力带来的计算开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的3D建模方法存在严重的扩展性问题，因为它们依赖多视图输入图像的全注意力机制。当视图数或图像分辨率增加时，计算成本变得不可接受。

Method: 通过引入迭代大规模3D重建模型（iLRM），该方法应用了三大核心原则：1）将场景表示与输入视图图像解耦，生成紧凑的3D表示；2）将全注意力多视图交互分解为两阶段注意力机制以降低计算成本；3）在每一层注入高分辨率信息以实现高保真重建。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集RE10K和DL3DV上的实验表明，iLRM在重建质量和速度方面优于现有方法，具有更高的扩展能力。在同等计算成本下，通过高效利用更多输入视图，iLRM实现了显著更高的重建质量。

Conclusion: iLRM能够以较低计算成本实现高质量和高效的3D重建，为可扩展的3D建模提供了一种新方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了UniLIP，用于统一图像理解、生成和编辑任务，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，实现了保持CLIP理解能力同时增加生成和重建性能的目标，并在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在统一理解、生成与编辑任务时需依赖额外扩展导致一致性差或理解性能下降的问题。

Method: 引入两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略强化CLIP的重建能力，提出双条件结构结合多模态隐藏状态，用于支持文本到图像生成及编辑任务。

Result: UniLIP在GenEval和WISE数据集上得分分别为0.87和0.53，在ImgEdit基准测试中得分3.62，均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的应用范围，不仅保持其在理解任务中的优异表现，还在生成与编辑任务中表现出强竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过BLiM和候选优先级归一化（CPN）来改进文本-视频检索，克服了现有方法中因候选优先级偏差带来的问题，显著提升检索表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂或长查询时使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），但模型容易因候选优先级而产生偏差，削弱了检索的准确性。

Method: 提出了一个双向似然估计框架BLiM，通过训练模型从视频生成文本以及从文本生成视频特征，同时引入无训练需求的候选优先级归一化（CPN）模块，以校正候选优先级偏差，提升模型表现。

Result: 在四个文本-视频检索基准上，BLiM结合CPN平均在R@1指标上提高了6.4分，大幅超过现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 该方法显著缓解了候选优先级偏差问题，强调查询与候选项的相关性，同时分析表明CPN模块有助于其他多模态任务的视觉理解。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的评估指标如IoU和mAP无法有效地检测文档布局模型中出现的结构性错误，如区域合并、拆分和遗漏内容。

Method: 设计了一个新的基准LED，用于定义八种标准化的错误类型，并提出三个互补任务。同时构建了一个合成数据集LED-Dataset，通过基于现有模型经验分布注入错误来生成。

Result: 通过实验，LED能够有效区分布局模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标未能体现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为评价文档布局分析模型的结构鲁棒性提供了更为全面的工具，弥补了传统评估方法的不足，具有较大的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种解耦的几何图像编辑方法，将对象转移、源区域修复、目标区域细化三个任务分开处理，并提出无需训练的扩散方法FreeFine，其在GeoBench任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的扩散编辑方法在处理较复杂或大规模的图像变换时效果较差，本文试图通过解耦编辑过程解决这一问题。

Method: 提出解耦式的几何图像编辑流程，包括对象变换、源区域修复及目标区域细化；引入无需训练的扩散方法FreeFine进行区域修复与细化。

Result: 在新的GeoBench基准上，FreeFine方法在图像质量和编辑精度方面优于现有方法，特别是在复杂变换情境下表现突出。

Conclusion: 解耦的编辑框架以及FreeFine方法提供了一种针对复杂几何图像编辑的高效解决方案，并在实验中实际验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ST-SAM的半监督伪装目标检测（SSCOD）新框架，仅使用1%标注数据即可达到全监督方法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少高昂的标注成本，利用有限标注数据和大量未标注数据提升伪装目标检测性能。

Method: 提出ST-SAM框架，引入动态自训练策略和结合Segment Anything Model的伪标签混合提示，以单模型结构代替多网络结构，解决预测偏差与误差传播问题。

Result: ST-SAM在伪装目标检测基准数据集上表现出色，仅使用1%标注数据即可超越现有方法，并与全监督方法相匹敌。

Conclusion: ST-SAM创新性地摆脱了传统SSCOD限制，提供了一种高效标注的全新范式。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Conclusion: PriorFusion通过有效整合多种先验信息克服了复杂环境感知的困难，提高了道路元素的预测精度和一致性，为自动驾驶感知提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Motivation: 尽管文本到图像扩散模型在生成艺术内容方面表现出色，但其内部如何表示内容与风格这一重要问题仍未被探索。

Method: 研究使用了基于transformer的文本到图像扩散模型，通过交叉注意力热图将生成图像中的像素与特定的提示词进行关联分析，以隔离内容描述与风格描述词所影响的图像区域。

Result: 结果显示，扩散模型对内容和风格的区分能力取决于艺术提示词和风格请求；大多数情况下，内容词影响对象相关区域，而风格词影响背景与纹理区域。

Conclusion: 研究表明扩散模型在生成艺术品时展现了内容与风格区分的潜在能力，并推动了对生成模型如何表示复杂艺术概念的理解。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过实现专注于前景信息的视觉标记修剪，显著提高了自主驾驶场景中的性能，同时兼具高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Method: 提出了 FASTopoWM 框架，其中包括快速与慢速系统的并行监督，以及基于动作潜在的查询和 BEV 世界模型来传播状态表示。

Result: 在 OpenLane-V2 基准测试中，FASTopoWM 在车道段检测（37.4% 对比 33.6%，mAP）和中心线感知（46.3% 对比 41.5%，OLS）方面超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FASTopoWM 通过引入快速-慢速系统和潜在世界模型，提高了时间传感性能，为端到端自动驾驶的感知模块提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Conclusion: 该框架解决了领域转移导致的性能下降问题，通过改进特征调整和一致性约束，提高了医学图像分割模型的适应性和精确度，在多领域环境下展示出显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个稳健的道路表面重建框架，通过整合遮挡感知的2D高斯表面点与语义引导的颜色增强，克服动态遮挡、静态障碍可见性以及光照和天气的影响，实现高质量的道路重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于网格渲染或3D高斯技术的重建方法对动态遮挡、视觉杂波以及光照和天气的变化敏感，难以在真实城市环境中进行稳健的道路重建。

Method: 提出使用平面适应的高斯表面点进行高效大型建模，通过分割引导的视视频修复消除动态和静态前景对象，并利用语义感知的颜色校正提高颜色一致性。

Result: 在城市规模数据集上的实验显示，该框架在视觉连贯性和几何精度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架是一种在真实世界条件下实用且有效的道路重建方法，为自主驾驶的高精度地图制作提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Motivation: 研究低分辨率图像对深度学习基础的人脸检测模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在不同分辨率(160x160, 320x320, 640x640)对三种模型进行评估，分析其精度、召回率、mAP和推理时间等指标。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下检测精度领先，YOLOv12召回略高，MTCNN在实时推理速度方面较弱但定位表现较好。

Conclusion: 为在不同操作约束条件下选择适合的分辨率感知人脸检测模型提供实用见解。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Method: 构建并公开了大规模AGTH评估数据集，并结合主客观指标（包括第一帧、Y-T切片、音调-嘴唇一致性）分析AGTH质量。

Result: 提出的方法在AGTH质量评估上实现了先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据集与评估方法为AI生成头部研究领域提供了新的工具和方向，并显著提升了评估的综合有效性。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉中的关键设计模式及其背后的技术进步，以推动深度学习模型的发展。

Method: 通过对六篇具有影响力的论文进行回顾与分析，包括从图像识别基础架构（如ResNet和ViT）到生成模型（GANs与LDMs），以及自监督学习方法（DINO和MAE）。

Result: 展示了这些关键设计模式的创新点及其在图像分类和生成中的显著效果，例如LDMs在高保真图像合成中的先进性和MAE在大规模模型预训练中的高效性。

Conclusion: 通过研究这些设计模式，明确了计算机视觉领域中从结构设计到优化方法的演进，并进一步指明了该领域发展的未来方向。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Motivation: 现代大规模视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）因参数规模庞大和计算成本高昂，限制了其实用性，而自然语言处理（NLP）领域的层剪枝方法为LVLMs的高效压缩提供潜在的解决方法。

Method: 文章通过实验证明直接采用NLP领域的层剪枝方法在LVLMs中效果不佳，并进一步诊断出关键问题后，提出了Short-LVLM框架，利用重要的视觉-语言标记并减小层间特征差距，提升效率和性能。

Result: 短-LVLM框架不仅在性能和效率之间实现了优越的权衡，同时具备无需训练、模型无关、高兼容性等潜在优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM框架为LVLMs提供了一种有效的层剪枝解决方案，同时强调其运行高效且应用广泛。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基于学习的特征匹配方法性能虽然出色，但依赖于Transformer的注意力机制，计算成本高。本研究旨在解决这一效率问题。

Method: 通过整合Mamba的高效长序列处理和Transformer的注意力机制，提出了多种VMatcher配置，包括分层结构。

Result: VMatcher在保持高效性和稳定性能的同时，为实时推理设定了新基准。

Conclusion: VMatcher在性能和效率之间实现了平衡，为计算密集型任务提供了更优的解决方案，适合实时应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

TL;DR: UniEmo是一种统一的情感生成与理解框架，通过多层次情感特征提取和融合机制，实现情感任务的互相增强，并显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感理解与生成方法通常是分离的，而情感任务的本质决定了两者可以互相补充和增强，因此有必要设计一个统一框架来结合这两种任务。

Method: 提出了UniEmo框架，包括通过分层情感理解链提取多尺度情感特征，以及融合这些特征与情感表征来指导扩散模型生成情感图片。同时，设计了情感相关系数与情感条件损失以增强生成的多样性与真实性。此外，通过数据过滤算法选取高质量生成图片，进一步优化理解能力。

Conclusion: UniEmo通过联合情感生成与理解的任务，不仅实现了相互优化，还为情感任务提供了一种创新的解决方案，实用性与性能均具有较高价值。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理多源领域自适应时容易因标签噪声导致特征学习不稳定，从而表现不佳。

Method: 通过从高置信度的目标样本开始逐步扩展到更具挑战性的样本，以渐进方式对齐CLIP模型，从而减轻错误传播及确认偏差的影响。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三大基准上实现了最新的精度表现，优于大多数CLIP基础方法。

Conclusion: MP^2A方法显著提高了多源无监督领域自适应的稳定性和有效性，可以有效应对标签噪声的问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有的3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）存在对高斯初始化敏感、空间感知能力有限以及高斯间关联性弱等局限性，亟需优化其表现力。

Method: 通过引入NeRF-GS框架，对NeRF与3DGS进行联合优化，同时共享3D空间信息。通过优化隐含特征和高斯位置的残差向量解决两种方法的形式差异，并增强3DGS的个性化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，NeRF-GS在基准数据集上超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NeRF与3DGS是互补的，而非竞争的。NeRF-GS的研究为结合3DGS与NeRF的混合方法提供了新视角，用于高效3D场景表示。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

Motivation: 解决医学领域影像-文本学习中忽视结构化语义及对大量负样本依赖的问题。

Method: 使用自适应双向分组机制，通过稀疏相似矩阵进行分组，并引入动态门限模块及实例感知分组对齐损失实现组内外语义对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集的图像-文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，兼顾了微调与零样本能力。

Conclusion: AGA克服了现有方法的局限性，能有效提取影像和报告中的结构化语义并提高任务性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 在医学影像中，低发病率病理检测缺乏标签且对数据不平衡敏感，现有方法计算昂贵且可靠性差。

Method: 引入一种基于Stein分数的去噪扩散模型（SBDDM），利用其正向扩散轨迹曲率进行异常评分，只需五步扩散，实现重建自由分析。

Result: 单一预训练SBDDM可在多个Near-OOD和Far-OOD基准上达到最先进性能，相对改进高达10.43%和18.10%，推理计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是实时、可靠计算机辅助诊断的实用工具，尤其在无标签医学影像异常检测中具有显著价值。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: 该系统分为两个子系统：植物来源识别子系统和掺假检测子系统。两者均先利用线性判别分析(LDA)提取特征，然后使用K近邻(KNN)模型进行分类和掺假程度量化。

Result: 基于公开的蜂蜜高光谱图像数据集，系统总体交叉验证准确率达到96.39%。

Conclusion: 提出的系统能够高效准确地检测蜂蜜掺假，是现有化学检测方法的一种有效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前艺术风格分类领域面临标注数据稀缺以及特征间复杂非线性交互的问题，现有双教师框架难以处理整体风格上下文和复杂风格特征的交互。

Method: 通过用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）取代传统MLP投影和预测头，增强双教师知识蒸馏框架，以分别从局部纹理和整体风格层级中提取非线性特征关联。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上表现出较高的分类准确性，尤其在Top-1准确率和线性探测精度方面超越了传统双教师架构。

Conclusion: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks能够有效解构复杂风格特征并增强艺术风格分类的表现，有潜力替代传统MLP在类似任务中的应用。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于光谱影像(Hyperspectral Image, HSI)可调压缩的新模型HyCASS，其在光谱与空间压缩的结合以及效率上表现卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着遥感领域中光谱数据的迅速增长，压缩存储的需求也急剧上升，但目前对光谱与空间压缩联合效应的分析尚少。本研究旨在深入分析光谱、空间和联合冗余对HSI压缩的影响。

Method: 提出HyCASS模型，由6大模块组成：光谱编码器、空间编码器、压缩率适配编码器与解码器、空间解码器和光谱解码器。模型结合卷积层和Transformer模块来捕获短程与长程冗余。

Result: 实验表明，HyCASS在两个HSI基准数据集上相较现有压缩模型表现更优，并提供了在不同压缩率条件下平衡光谱与空间压缩的有效指引。

Conclusion: HyCASS模型在提供可调的光谱空间压缩方面展示了优异的性能，为未来该领域的研究与应用提供了宝贵的参考。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用机器学习方法通过数据训练模型，从复杂数据关系中识别模式并解决问题。

Method: 对5824张胸部X光片实验，分别实现基本的卷积神经网络(CNN)和DenseNet-121并进行比较分析。

Result: DenseNet-121在二分类问题中表现优于基本CNN，并能更专注于输入图像的关键部分进行决策。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在疾病预测和胸片分析中具有显著优势，充分展示了其辨别能力。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

*Taeheon Lim,Joohyung Lee,Kyungjae Lee,Jungchan Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了联邦学习在处理非分类任务时的挑战，特别是因客户端分辨率差异引发的“分辨率漂移”问题，并提出了一种以热图知识蒸馏为基础的解决方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，联邦学习作为一种保护用户隐私的去中心化学习方式备受关注，但其主要应用于分类任务，对于非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）的研究较少。本论文旨在填补这一研究空白，分析因数据分辨率异质性导致的“分辨率漂移”问题对性能的影响。

Method: 提出一种名为分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF）的方法，通过多分辨率的热图知识蒸馏，在高分辨率输出（教师模型）和低分辨率输出（学生模型）之间进行知识传递，从而提高模型对分辨率变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF方法有效缓解了分辨率漂移问题，大幅提升了性能，并且能够无缝集成到现有的联邦学习框架中。此外，t-SNE分析显示RAF在保留空间细节的任务上具备泛化潜力。

Conclusion: RAF为解决非独立同分布数据中的分辨率问题提供了新思路，尤其适用于高分辨率表征任务。这一方法不仅增强了联邦学习的鲁棒性，也扩大了其应用范围。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

*Bin Xie,Congxuan Zhang,Fagan Wang,Peng Liu,Feng Lu,Zhen Chen,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CST Anti-UAV，一个用于复杂场景微型无人机单目标跟踪（SOT）的全新热红外数据集，包含220个视频序列和超过24万框架标注。此外，该数据集引入了详细的属性注释，并评估了20种现有方法的表现。实验结果显示，当前最佳方法表现仍有限，这强调了进一步研究的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无人机跟踪数据集在场景复杂性和属性表达方面缺乏多样性，限制了其实用性，因此需要一个更适合复杂场景的无人机跟踪数据集。

Method: 作者提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，其特点包括微型无人机目标、高质量标注和复杂多样的场景，并通过全面的属性注释进行精准评估，然后使用该数据集分析了20种现有单目标跟踪方法的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，复杂环境中跟踪微型无人机仍有很大挑战，最先进方法的状态精确度仅为35.92%，显著低于已有数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV的发布将促进更加鲁棒的单目标跟踪方法和反无人机系统的创新开发。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D视觉语言模型在推理和泛化能力上存在不足，主要原因在于高质量空间数据不足和静态视角假设的局限性。作者希望通过新的方法克服这些挑战。

Method: 作者首先创建了一个高质量的合成数据集Scene-30K用于冷启动，并在强化学习框架中引入GRPO策略以及三种奖励函数（感知奖励、语义相似性奖励、格式奖励）来增强推理能力。同时提出动态视角选择策略以自适应地优化场景理解。

Conclusion: 3D-R1通过创新的数据集构建、强化学习策略和动态视角选择，从根本上解决了3D视觉语言模型在场景理解任务中的核心问题，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Conclusion: 提出的模型在有限资源环境中实现了基于AI的多任务功能，显著推进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based
acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between
sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance
curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现更高精度的3D仿真数据，突破了数据驱动的3D仿真研究的瓶颈。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法解决了传统方法在复杂遮挡模式下的关键局限性，为自动采摘和产量监测提供了较为稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于欧几里得空间的图像配准方法难以处理跨模态失配，导致对齐和融合质量不佳，因此需要探索在非欧几里得空间中进行图像配准的方法。

Method: 提出了Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment Network（Hy-CycleAlign），利用超曲面空间进行配准与融合，并设计了双路径跨模态循环配准框架以及Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment（H2CA）模块。

Result: 实验表明，Hy-CycleAlign在跨模态图像的配准和融合性能上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 超曲面空间为多模态图像的配准和融合提供了更高效的解决方案，Hy-CycleAlign是一个有前景的方法。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 通过分析模型对像素集中区域的依赖性，可以更深入地了解不同架构的行为，并为未来模型选择提供参考。

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VRD模型仅使用关系检测数据进行训练，难以泛化到所训练关系以外的场景。

Method: 引入了ART框架，通过指令微调和自适应实例选择，将VRD数据集转化为指令微调格式，并使用自适应采样算法优化训练。

Result: 提出的方法相较于基线显著提高了性能，尤其在预测未见过的关系概念上表现出色。

Conclusion: ART框架能够实现更具泛化性的VRD，同时在复杂场景分割任务中展现了其实用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

Motivation: 手语翻译任务难以跨越视觉与语言信息的跨度，并需要精准捕捉手部细微动作的变化，现有方法在长期细节建模上存在障碍。此研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入BeyondGloss框架，通过视频大语言模型生成时间感知的手部运动文本描述，采用对齐模块和特征蒸馏，同时使用对比损失缩小跨模态间的差距。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib实现了基于V2X的自动化基础设施摄像头校准，具有高效性与鲁棒性，为未来大规模部署提供了可能性。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决单视图图像生成3D头像时未见部分的细节推测和3D一致性问题。

Conclusion: MoGA实现了从单视图图像生成高保真、3D一致、支持动画的头像，同时解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Conclusion: 新方法展示了在精度与计算效率之间的优异平衡能力，为资源受限的真实环境实时部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Vcamba的新方法，用于解决视频伪装目标检测(VCOD)中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的VCOD方法主要依赖于空间外观特征，受限于其对高相似前景和背景的区分能力。研究发现频率特征可以补充外观特征的不足并感知动态变化的运动线索。

Method: 提出Vcamba框架，集成空间和频率特征，通过设计新的模块（RFVSS、AFE、SLMP、FLMP和SFMF），实现高效准确的VCOD。

Result: Vcamba在两组数据集的6项评价指标上超过了现有最先进方法，并显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的Vcamba方法通过结合空间和频率域双重特征，有效提升了VCOD的准确性和效率，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: MIDI-B挑战提供了基于HIPAA和DICOM的标准化平台，用于评估医学图像去身份化工具性能。比赛分为训练、验证和测试三阶段，参与者使用合成PHI/PII的DICOM图像进行测试，最佳准确率达99.93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动医学图像共享与人工智能开发，同时确保符合患者隐私法律并保留研究关键元数据。

Method: 基于HIPAA、DICOM等规则开发的去身份化标准化评估平台，对参与者的算法进行多阶段测试，并提供合成标识符的真实影像数据。

Result: 10支队伍完成最终测试，去身份化准确率在97.91%-99.93%间。采用多种开源与专有工具、语言模型及OCR技术。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战成功证明了高效去身份化的可能性，并提供了关于平台设计和工具开发的经验。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在处理新条件时缺乏泛化性并且适应成本较高，需要改进训练效率和生成效果。

Method: 采用SVD分解ControlNet结构，将其分为条件无关和特定部分，通过知识分流在多条件训练中实现解耦，并使用动态门软路由技术实现零样本泛化和高效适应。同时引入表示对齐损失提升条件嵌入与扩散特征的一致性。

Result: DivControl在可控性和训练成本方面领先，同时在未见条件下展现出优秀的零样本及少样本性能，体现了更好的扩展性和模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升生成能力和适应效率方面达到了最新技术水平，并为未见条件提供了高效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Result: EMAT在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上优于所有现有方法，并且使用了至少四倍更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升Few-shot分类与分割性能，尤其是对小目标效果，同时提出更贴近实际的两种新评估设定。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了SNN训练中的难题，还在多个数据集上取得优异表现，展示了能效优势，适合能耗敏感场景。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Conclusion: OmniTraj模型验证了一种新的、高效的时序动态泛化方法，其实现了在不同数据集间的强泛化能力。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了FlowGaussian-VR，一种用于高保真3D视频重建的流加速速度场建模方法，旨在解决复杂运动和显著尺度变化带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂运动和显著尺度变化下无法有效处理动态内容的问题。

Method: 提出了基于光流优化的速度场渲染(VFR)管线和流辅助的自适应稠密化(FAD)策略，以改进动态区域的3D视频重建。

Result: 相比现有方法，FlowGaussian-VR在多个真实场景数据集上的PSNR提升超过2.5dB，同时减轻了动态纹理中的模糊伪影，并实现了规则、可跟踪的高斯轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法在高保真3D视频重建中显著提高了视觉质量和动态效果，同时增强了轨迹的可追踪性和规则性。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Motivation: 深度学习模型的像素归因方法在图像分类中虽受欢迎，但其预测结果可能存在过度自信问题。为此研究提出一种方法，改进像素归因的同时评估风险。

Method: 方法通过分类模型与像素归因方法的迭代结合创建一组像素归因（PA）图谱，利用这些图谱生成像素分布，并通过期望值和变异系数（CV）生成增强的PA图和像素级风险估计。

Conclusion: 这种整合风险评估的像素归因方法改进了深度学习模型的预测可解释性，为图像分类中的安全决策提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

TL;DR: 提出一种新的方法DIAS，通过重初始化和自蒸馏改进Slot Attention模块，用于解决对象分割主要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对象学习方法存在冗余问题，且监督信号单一，导致对象被错误分割及任务效果受限。

Method: 提出DIAS算法，包含两部分：通过减少槽的冗余和重新初始化进行更新；通过自蒸馏提高初始和后续的注意力映射效果。

Result: 在对象发现与识别、视觉预测及推理任务上均取得了最新的领先表现。

Conclusion: DIAS有效解决现有问题，为对象学习任务设立新基准。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Method: 创建SUB数据集，通过Tied Diffusion Guidance方法确保生成图像的精确控制，允许对CBMs等模型在微小概念变化下的表现进行测试。

Result: 生成了包含38,400张图片的SUB数据集，涵盖33种鸟类和45个概念的分布变化，用于评估CBMs模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过一个精确控制的合成基准测试集推动CBMs的发展，有助于其在实际问题中的透明性和鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

Motivation: 当前3D可操作性推理方法在处理单对象、单步骤交互时表现良好，但无法应对长时间、多对象任务的复杂需求。本文旨在填补这一研究空白，为复杂3D场景中的多步骤任务提供解决方案。

Method: 提出SeqSplatNet框架，该框架通过大语言模型预测3D操作区域序列，同时引入条件几何重建策略，提升模型对复杂几何场景的鲁棒性。还通过特征注入机制，融合2D视觉模型的语义信息，大幅加强了3D解码性能。

Result: 在全新的SeqAffordSplat基准上，SeqSplatNet实验结果表明其在复杂场景中的长序列任务推理能力远超现有方法。

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet推动了3D可操作性推理从单步交互到复杂场景的多步骤任务演进，为实现现实中的复杂应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Motivation: 现有的3D人类模型（如SMPL-X）在处理与环境的物理交互时存在局限性，例如实体穿透和物体动态的不真实。研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种'半物理'机制，将3D运动学动作转换为物理模拟，在保留SMPL-X运动学控制的同时实现与场景和物体的物理交互。

Conclusion: 该研究为3D人类模型在物理交互场景中提供了一个实时、学习无关且高保真度的解决方案，展示了显著改进的物理交互能力。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏视角的重建问题，适用于多样化动态场景，同时公开了代码和数据以促进研究。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Conclusion: 该研究为高质量动画3D内容生成奠定基础，其对真实视频输入的良好适应性尤为值得注意。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Motivation: 在线住宿预订平台依赖于第三方数据来源，这些数据常面临信息不完整或不一致的问题，导致用户体验不佳及市场流失。旨在利用LLMs改进住宿数据质量。

Method: 通过将LLMs集成到CALEIDOHOTELS平台，评估Mistral 7B和Mixtral 8x7B两种模型，并对其内容生成的完整性、一致性以及幻觉率进行测评。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6% vs. 93%）、准确性（98.8% vs. 96%）以及幻觉率（1.2% vs. 4%）上优于Mistral 7B，但需要更高的计算资源（50GB VRAM $1.61/小时 vs 5GB VRAM $0.16/小时）。

Conclusion: Mixtral 8x7B尽管资源成本更高，但在改善住宿数据一致性和可靠性方面效果显著。研究提供了关于模型质量与资源效率权衡的实际见解。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate

outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

TL;DR: 该研究介绍了ElectriQ，一个专用于评估和增强电力营销场景中大语言模型的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电力客户服务系统响应慢、灵活性差且特定领域任务准确性有限，因此需要改进大语言模型以适应电力营销需求。

Method: 提出ElectriQ基准，包括六类服务对话数据集和四种评估指标，同时结合领域知识库并提出知识增强方法用于提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，通过微调和增强后的小型模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性方面优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为开发适应电力营销需求的大语言模型奠定了全面基础。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种分层分类框架，通过结合语言模型和半监督学习策略，有效检测和分类非法市场内容，实验结果表明性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法市场内容扩散至深网、暗网及各类线上平台，检测和分类这些内容因数据不足、语言演化和平台多样性面临挑战。

Method: 采用ModernBERT进行语义表示提取，结合手工特征和半监督学习，基于两阶段分类管道：第一阶段检测销售相关文档，第二阶段进一步分类为药物、武器或凭证销售。

Result: 在包括多源语料库、DUTA和CoDA的三个数据集上，提出的模型显示出优于多个基线模型（如BERT、DarkBERT等）的性能，准确率达到0.96489，F1分数为0.93467，TMCC为0.95388。

Conclusion: 该模型在少量监督下表现出强大的泛化能力、鲁棒性和实际应用效果，可以有效检测非法内容。

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Motivation: 探讨如何利用LLMs改进图书主题分析的表现，同时解决其过度生成和虚假信息问题。

Method: 提出一种混合框架，结合嵌入式ML模型和LLMs。ML模型预测最佳标签数，引导LLMs生成，同时利用ML模型对生成内容进行后期编辑，提高标签的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，混合框架可以生成更受控且与标准词表（LCSH）对齐的标签，显著提升输出质量。

Conclusion: 混合框架在改进主题分析方面表现优异，为处理未知数据提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的知识图谱（KG）集成方法，包括标签匹配和三元组匹配，并引入新的测试数据集以验证方法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的实体匹配方法在处理复杂多样的上下文融合场景中存在不足，需要一种能够整合多源、各异上下文的知识图谱的方法。

Method: 采用字符串操作、模糊匹配和向量相似性技术对实体和谓词标签进行对齐，并在三元组层次识别传递类似信息的映射，通过这些映射提升实体匹配的准确性。

Result: 提出的方法在OAEI竞赛及多个监督学习方法对比中表现具有竞争力，在多样化测试用例中获得较高的准确性。

Conclusion: 证明了三元组匹配在知识图谱上下文整合中的重要性，并通过推出新的数据集进一步验证方法的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Conclusion: 本文为应对大语言模型中幻觉这一关键挑战，构建了理论和实践基础，并提出了全面的检测、缓解和评估方法。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进RAG的框架，解决其在处理时间相关查询上的不足，实验表明该方法显著提高了答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在处理时间维度查询上不足的问题，特别是其无法同时考虑主题相关性和时间连贯性。

Method: 设计了一个新的RAG框架，通过解析用户查询的主题和时间窗口，使用专门的检索算法校准语义匹配与时间相关性，并引入评估基准ADQAB进行验证。

Result: 在ADQAB基准上的实验结果显示，新方法比标准RAG实现的答案准确率高出13%-27%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了RAG系统在复杂时间演变分析方面的能力，为解决真实世界复杂问题铺平了道路。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的跨模型可解释性及其在不同规模下特征的统一性，这对于理解模型的设计与应用具有重要意义。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）词典学习管道分析模型的残差流激活，通过激活相关性对单语义特征进行对齐，并用SVCCA和RSA比较匹配的特征空间。此外，还进行了从单个token到多token子空间的初步实验。

Result: 中间层特征表现出最强的重叠性，而早期和晚期层的相似性较低；多token子空间的初步实验表明语义相似的子空间与模型的交互方式相似。

Conclusion: 尽管规模不同，大语言模型仍能对世界进行类似的、可解释的特征划分。这种特征通用性为跨模型的可解释性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在临床实验开始前，预测其安全性结果的方法，为优化试验设计提供依据，避免不必要的试验终止和参与者风险。

Method: 通过22,107个临床试验的数据，构建分类器和回归模型，运用转移学习（如ClinicalT5和BioBERT），结合深度学习方法，并引入滑动窗口技术处理过长文本数据。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在预测高SAE比率组的AUC为77.6%，在预测对照组SAE比例的RMSE为18.6%。滑动窗口技术显著提升了模型表现。

Conclusion: 通过预训练语言模型和滑动窗口技术，可以有效预测临床试验的安全性结果，为优化试验设计提供实质性帮助。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

Conclusion: 本文弥合了传统矢量量化与现代LLM应用间的鸿沟，为高效、通用的多模态系统开发提供了基础性参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

Motivation: 现有语言模型虽然能捕获复杂关系，但计算开销大且易生成虚假的信息。针对这些问题，研究希望通过优化策略减少资源浪费并提高信息准确性。

Method: 提出了一种多阶段级联的LMC算法，依赖候选答案集验证文本信息准确性，不正确的响应将交由更强的语言模型重新预测，直至所有预测均正确。

Result: 在提取医疗文档中的出生日期任务中，LMC算法在速度和准确性上明显优于单一语言模型，同时显著减少了幻觉生成。

Conclusion: LMC算法为知识提取领域提供了重要创新，未来应进一步探索其潜力。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

Method: 基于Reddit r/wallstreetbets评论，使用两种现有情感分析方法，并引入基于ChatGPT-注释和优化的RoBERTa模型，通过相关性和因果性分析评估预测能力。

Result: 发现社交媒体情绪与股价变化的相关性较弱，而评论量和搜索趋势表现出更强的预测信号。

Conclusion: 传统情感分析方法可能无法完全捕捉市场趋势，需结合其他更直接的指标。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Conclusion: 研究建议在多语言系统中广泛采用多语言资源共享和跨语言提示优化，特别是针对低资源语言的应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

Motivation: 研究语言背景如何影响学生在线课程中同行反馈的情感与评价，以改善教育质量并促进跨文化互动。

Method: 利用Twitter-roBERTa模型对500名随机学生的同行审查情感进行分析，并将情感得分与语言背景、性别、年龄等变量进行关联研究。

Result: 发现母语者对反馈评价较低，非母语者的反馈更正面，却收到较负面的情感反馈。同时控制性别和年龄后发现语言背景影响显现出复杂性。

Conclusion: 语言背景对同行反馈有适度但复杂的影响，这提示教育者需考虑语言文化因素以改善在线教育体验。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了文档级关系抽取问题，提出了一种新型的输入嵌入方法，通过全局上下文建模与多句推理，改善了关系预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的方法仅关注实体出现的语句，未能有效捕获完整的文档上下文，导致关系抽取准确性不足。

Method: 提出了独特的输入编码方法，将实体作为独立段表示，捕获文档全局关系和支持多句子推理。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL等关系抽取数据集上取得了优异表现。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅在理论上推进了文档级关系抽取的全局上下文建模和多句推理，并且在实际场景中表现出色，有助于改进 NLP 系统的关系检测能力。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark，这是一种细粒度多层次的基准测试框架，用于评估检索增强生成（RAG）系统中大型语言模型（LLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统评估方法偏重总体性能，缺乏对LLM特定能力的系统和细致评估，尤其是在文档利用能力方面。

Method: 提出Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark，通过多层次维度（过滤能力、组合能力、参考推理）细致分析LLM利用外部知识的表现，并采用基于占位符的方法区分模型的内在与外部知识贡献。

Result: 实验表明当前主流LLM在RAG系统生成能力上存在局限性，特别是错误弹性和上下文真实性方面。

Conclusion: Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark是一个可复现框架，有助于开发更可靠、高效的RAG系统，相关代码公开在Github。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过链式思维（CoT）提示提升大型语言模型（LLM）在多步骤任务上的表现，研究了CoT生成的“思维”是否反映真实推理过程，提出了第一个CoT的特征级因果研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨链式思维提示是否能够真实反映语言模型内部推理，同时验证其对内部计算结构的影响以及跨模型规模的表现差异。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活补丁技术，从Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B模型中提取单语义特征，对比分析CoT和非CoT提示下模型处理GSM8K数学问题的表现。

Result: 在大规模模型（2.8B）中，CoT提示的特征互换显著提高答案的对数概率，同时提高激活稀疏性与特征可解释性；但在小规模模型（70M）中没有类似效果。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，链式思维可在高容量语言模型中引导更具解释性的内部结构，验证了其作为结构化提示方法的效用。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出EH-Benchmark，专用于评估医学大语言模型(MLLM)中视觉和逻辑推理相关的幻觉问题，并提出三阶段多智能体框架以降低幻觉发生率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM在眼科诊断中发挥重要作用，但因医学知识不足、视觉定位及推理能力受限和多模态数据不足，导致病变检测和疾病诊断的准确性下降。同时，目前医学基准未能全面评估模型幻觉的多样性，也未提供有效缓解方法。

Method: 提出了EH-Benchmark，专注评估模型中的两大类幻觉：视觉理解和逻辑组合，并通过知识检索、任务级案例研究和结果验证的三阶段多智能体框架降低幻觉风险。

Result: 实验结果表明，该多智能体框架显著减少了两类幻觉，提升了模型的诊断精度、解释性及可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark弥补现有评估指标不足，为眼科诊断中的模型幻觉分析提供了新的基准，并提出了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

*Shalini Jangra,Suparna De,Nishanth Sastry,Saeed Fadaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个生成社交平台个人信息识别（PII）文本的合成数据集的方法，并针对Reddit帖子开发了19种PII分类的合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究受限于缺少公开标注数据集，难以有效检测社交平台上披露的敏感PII信息，进而减少隐私泄露风险。

Method: 通过构建包含19种PII分类的分类法，并利用Llama2-7B、Llama3-8B及zephyr-7b-beta三种大型语言模型生成合成数据集，确保数据与原始数据在可复现性、非关联性、相似性之间的平衡。

Result: 合成数据集在模型训练中表现出与原始数据集等同的效果，同时保障生成数据不仅无法通过搜索关联至用户，并且与人类生成的数据难以区分。

Conclusion: 研究证明了方法的有效性，并公开了数据集及代码，为进一步研究社交媒体中PII风险提供支持。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

### [116] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种动态调整上下文压缩率的框架ACC-RAG，用于优化RAG生成效率，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统因检索到的长上下文导致推理成本高，而固定压缩率方法无法适应查询复杂度的变化，影响效率或准确性。

Method: 提出了一种动态上下文压缩框架ACC-RAG，通过结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，根据输入复杂度调整压缩率。

Result: 在Wikipedia和五个QA数据集上的测试表明，ACC-RAG比固定压缩率方法效果更好，并在保持或提高准确性的同时，实现了高达4倍的推理速度提升。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在保持准确性的基础上显著提升了推理效率，为RAG技术提供了一种适应性更强的压缩策略。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the

prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how

Conclusion: 验证了将协作专家框架与大语言模型结合在AIOps领域的有效性，可显著改善任务分类与解决性能。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于文本的检索增强生成（RAG）系统在处理涉及流图等图像信息的问题时表现乏力，尤其是在技术文档中。

Method: 通过使用VLM生成流图的图表示，将其整合到文本嵌入管道中，优化检索性能；包括处理文档、图像分类、构建图结构并融合文本嵌入过程。

Result: 实验结果表明采用微调后的VLM模型生成的图表示具有较低的编辑距离，展示了其在流图图像分析中的鲁棒性；且这种方法在QA任务中，通过文字嵌入模型实现了良好的检索表现。

Conclusion: 结合图表示的解决方案不仅提升了QA系统的检索能力，还降低了推理过程中对VLM的依赖，显著减少了系统部署成本。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

### [126] [Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940)
*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RELIANCE框架，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLM）中推理过程中的事实性错误现象，并显著提升模型的推理事实鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、法律分析和科学研究等高风险领域，模型在推理链中出现事实性错误但最终答案正确的现象可能误导用户，造成危险决策。

Method: 提出三部分框架：1. 使用反事实增强数据训练的专用事实核查分类器；2. 基于多维奖励的GRPO强化学习策略；3. 从激活层面分析事实性改进如何影响推理过程。

Result: 在十种最先进模型上进行评估，发现模型推理事实准确性普遍较低（例如Claude-3.7为81.93%，GPT-o1为82.57%），而RELIANCE框架将事实鲁棒性提升了最高49.90%，并在Math-500、AIME-2024等难题基准测试中保持或改善了性能。

Conclusion: RELIANCE框架通过激活引导的优化方法，为未来的训练方法奠定了针对事实鲁棒性的基础，同时显著改进了推理过程中的事实性表现。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SigBERT的创新框架，利用文本嵌入与时间序列特征来增强临床报告中的生存分析，最终通过LASSO-惩罚Cox模型预测患者风险，C-index达到0.75。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生存分析方法难以处理电子病历中复杂的文本数据序列化问题，研究旨在开发高效处理时序文档数据的方法。

Method: 提出SigBERT框架，提取时间戳文档中的词嵌入并转化为句嵌入，使用粗路径理论中的特征提取技术，结合LASSO-惩罚Cox模型预测患者特定的风险分数。

Result: 在Léon Bérard中心的实际肿瘤学数据集上，该模型C-index得分为0.75（标准差0.014），表现良好。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序文档中的信息，有效提升了基于叙述的生存分析的风险预测能力。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新方法，用于高效验证基于代码的健康结局算法的测量特性，通过自然语言处理（NLP）和多波次自适应抽样方法减少时间和资源开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大规模数据库的分析需要通过验证基于代码的算法的测量特性来提高精度，但人工审查耗时且资源消耗大。

Method: 研究引入了NLP技术以加速人工审查，以及多波次自适应抽样方法设定停止准则保证精度，同时减少审查所需的患者图表数量。

Result: NLP技术使每份图表审查时间减少40%，采用多波次抽样方法减少了77%的图表审查量，精度基本未受影响。

Conclusion: 此方法可更高效地验证基于代码的算法，提高数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文将“武断”重新定义为一种结构化人类系统的功能性机制，而非不公正的表现。由人类社会延伸到人工智能领域，提出理论为解释性分析提供新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视“武断”含义，挑战其与不公正的传统关联，并体现其在系统操作中的重要性。

Method: 提出“动机-可验证性-可争议性”链，分析动机如何使行为逻辑在交互中易受质疑。同时应用能源熵模型构建武断新理论框架。

Result: 阐明武断作为系统操作的核心机制，展示其在语言、法律和社会互动中的适用性，并将其扩展至解释人工智能系统行为。

Conclusion: 武断是系统设计中不可或缺的中性机制。其隐形逻辑虽然减少了问责，但在不同领域中赋予了系统稳定性与功能性。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含英语和中文的基准数据集，用于评估语音对话模型（SDMs）处理实际对话挑战的能力，同时提出了更接近人类判断的LLM评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音对话模型在理解和模拟人类对话方面的实用性和挑战，以弥补现有研究与文本语言模型相比的不足。

Method: 制作一个包含1079实例的英语和中文数据集，用以测试语音对话模型的性能，并使用基于大语言模型的评估方法进行分析。

Result: 该基准数据集和评估方法推动了对语音对话模型实际能力的全面探讨，尤其是在应对歧义情境和多轮上下文依赖性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 通过基准数据集和新的评估方法，可以更科学地理解语音对话模型的真实表现，为未来发展提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

TL;DR: 研究探讨现今的大型语言模型（LLMs）能否在数学文本中执行自然语言推理（NLI）任务，并提供相关文献对比和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLMs在数学文本推理中的表现，并为提升Math NLI的研究提供高质量的数据。

Method: 构建一个Math NLI语料库，其中前提来自现有数学文本，假设和标签由具有数学和NLI领域经验的人提供，并分析LLMs生成的假设质量。同时比较不同LLMs在推理任务中的表现和一致性。

Result: 发现LLMs在某些情况下的推理表现可与人类标注的结果相媲美，但在理解数学语言和基本推理上仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI任务中表现存在局限性，但其潜力和局部优势值得进一步研究，且提供的语料库可支持未来相关工作。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨在大语言模型（LLM）上使用上下文学习（ICL）进行无微调的框架语义解析（FSP）。提出了一种基于FrameNet数据库自动生成针对任务的提示方法，从而实现了较高的F1评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为避免传统模型微调的复杂性，探索如何通过大语言模型的上下文学习方法完成领域特定的框架语义解析任务。

Method: 基于FrameNet数据库，自动生成用于框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL）的任务特定提示，并将这些提示应用于六种不同的大语言模型中以指导任务。

Result: 在与暴力事件相关的框架子集中实验，FI和FSRL任务分别达到了94.3%和77.4%的F1分数，具有较强的竞争力。

Conclusion: 上下文学习方法为领域特定的框架语义解析任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代方案，无需进行模型微调。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

TL;DR: CARoPE通过动态生成与上下文相关的频率模式，改进了Transformer的RoPE编码，在多个任务中表现优于RoPE且适用于长文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE虽然在效率和相对位置编码方面表现出众，但其固定的正弦频率模式限制了捕捉上下文相关关系的能力。

Method: 提出CARoPE，通过结合输入相关的相位偏移动态生成与上下文相关的频率模式，并在多注意力头中整合这种机制，同时保持RoPE的效率与结构简单性。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集以及GPT-2模型中测评，CARoPE在降低困惑度、处理长文本方面表现优于RoPE，同时提升了训练效率并保障了模型的稳定性。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了更具扩展性、表现力及高效的定位编码解决方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在局部编辑时缺乏全局一致性的问题，提高编辑质量。

Method: 通过Reward-Refine的推理期奖励引导和RewardDPO的训练期偏好优化实现全局一致性。

Result: 提出的模型在SMARTEdit-Bench基准测试中相较于基线模型有显著优势，最多提升15%的性能。

Conclusion: 使用奖励引导的规划方法能有效提高编辑的语义一致性和视觉匹配性。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的数据库自然语言接口在处理企业级数据目录时存在部署复杂、语义上下文利用不足等局限。

Method: 将数据库模式和元数据分解为独立的语义单元，分别索引以进行针对性检索，并通过表和列的信息管理上下文预算。

Result: 所提出的方法在大规模和结构多样的数据库中实现了高召回率和准确率，并在无需专用微调的情况下优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方案填补了自然语言数据库接口在企业环境中扩展性方面的关键空白，实现了可推广的企业级部署。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在面对语言歧义时的信任性问题，尤其关注中文歧义文本的处理能力。

Method: 构建了一个基准数据集，包括具有上下文的歧义句子及其多种可能解释的消歧对，并将其分为3大类和9小类，以分析模型的表现。

Result: 实验表明，现有的大型语言模型在辨别歧义文本与非歧义文本方面不可靠，且容易过度自信地将歧义文本理解为单一意义或过度思考可能的多种意义。

Conclusion: 现有大型语言模型在处理语言歧义上存在根本性局限性，这对其在含有语言歧义的实际应用中部署提出了警示，同时需提出改进模型处理不确定性的方案。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

TL;DR: 提出了ISO-Bench，用于评估模型是否能推断视觉观察与程序文本之间的因果依赖关系，现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨模态因果关系推断的能力，是在真实环境中操作的多模态模型的核心挑战。

Method: 提供基准ISO-Bench，每个样例包含任务步骤的图像和计划文本片段，模型需判断图像步骤发生在文本步骤之前或之后。

Result: 在十个最新视觉-语言模型上的实验结果显示性能一般。最佳零样本F1值仅为0.57，即使链式推理也仅提升至0.62，远低于人类0.98的表现。

Conclusion: 目前模型在多模态因果理解方面表现较差，需要进一步研究改进方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

TL;DR: 研究探索从用户与语言模型（LM）交互日志中提取隐式用户反馈以改进模型表现，分析反馈内容的作用与局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型部署后需要长期与用户交互，并基于用户反馈不断进化，而直接向用户索取反馈可能会中断交互，因此探索如何利用隐式用户反馈改进模型显得尤为重要。

Method: 研究了两个用户与语言模型交互数据集（WildChat和LMSYS），分析用户-模型对话中的隐式反馈内容及收集学习信号的方法，并评估其对短问题和长问题的模型性能提升效果。

Result: 反馈内容（例如澄清需求）对短问题（MTBench）的模型性能有积极影响，但对长问题（WildBench）的效果有限，且用户初始提示的质量显著影响反馈的效用。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈具有改进语言模型性能的潜力，但存在局限性，其有效性依赖于用户初始提示质量等因素。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过分析内部表示来估计模型信心的新方法LENS，并在多项任务中表现优于传统集合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的集合方法在结合多种大语言模型的预测时缺乏对模型信心和可靠性的动态考量。

Method: 提出了LENS方法，通过分析LLM的内部表示（如隐藏状态和归一化概率），训练轻量的线性信心预测器，以动态调整模型预测的权重。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务上，LENS比传统集合方法表现出了显著的优势。

Conclusion: 内部表示可作为重要信号，用于确定模型信心并优化集合学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用GEAK框架，通过先进的大语言模型生成针对AMD GPU优化的高效Triton代码，并展示了其在正确性和执行速度方面的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载日益复杂和多样化，手动优化GPU内核既耗时又具有挑战性，自动化生成高性能内核需求迫切。

Method: 提出了一种名为GEAK的框架，利用大语言模型和Reflexion风格反馈机制，在推理时进行计算扩展，用于生成高效的Triton内核代码。

Result: GEAK在两个评估基准上显著超越了直接提示前沿LLM和基于Reflexion的生成管道，正确率提升至63%，运行速度提高至2.59倍。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了采用具备代理特性的代码生成方法加速多样化硬件平台采用的潜力，并推动专家级内核性能的普及。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新方法，利用负样本来优化正样本选择，从而提升大语言模型在少样本情景学习中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要专注于通过检索正样本提高少样本情景学习，但忽视了负样本中的附加信息。

Method: 首先基于Zero-Shot-Cot构造正样本和负样本语料库，在推理阶段基于语义相似性从正负样本语料库中检索出相关样本，然后进一步利用负样本从正样本语料库中选择更多相关的正样本，最终将这些样本结合作为情景学习的示例。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在少样本学习中优于只利用正样本的传统方法，验证了负样本信息的辅助作用。

Conclusion: 负样本的引入能有效提高大语言模型少样本学习的正样本选择和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主题模型——机械主题模型（MTMs），利用稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）的可解释特征，解决了传统主题模型无法捕捉语义抽象特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型受限于词袋模型或简单的词表表示，难以捕捉复杂的语义特征，且无法实现灵活可控的文本生成。

Method: 提出了机械主题模型（MTMs），基于稀疏自动编码器学到的可解释特征定义主题，还设计了基于LLM的主题比较评估框架——Topic Judge。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统和神经网络主题模型表现相当甚至更好，并在主题判断评价上具有优势，同时支持可控的文本生成。

Conclusion: MTMs通过语义丰富的特征表示，改善了主题发现和文本生成的能力，是对现有主题模型的重要扩展。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: 提出TAP-GPT框架，通过表格化LLM对AD早期诊断进行预测，有效整合了复杂的生物标记信息，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默症（AD）的早期诊断需要使用多种异质的生物标记数据，而大语言模型（LLM）具有灵活的推理、多模态整合和基于自然语言的可解释性能力，为利用这些结构化生物医学数据的预测提供了前所未有的机会。

Method: 设计了一种名为TAP-GPT的新框架，通过基于表格专用的多模态LLM（TableGPT2），使用少样本推理和qLoRA调整技术，以完成AD或认知正常的二分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT框架结合了TableGPT2的表格理解能力和LLM的先验知识，实验中优于先进的通用LLM和针对表格预测任务设计的基础模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLM应用于基于表格化生物标记数据的预测任务的研究，开创了未来LLM驱动的多智能体框架在生物医学信息领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Motivation: 目前关于心理健康的个性化聊天机器人有显著进展，但在解释性及对话推理方面的研究不足。作者旨在探索LLMs在心理健康领域的语用推理潜力。

Method: 1. 提出了P-ReMe数据集，重定义语用现象（如隐含意义和假设）。2. 制定了两个涉及隐含意义的任务和一个假设任务。3. 使用Llama3.1、Mistral、MentaLLaMa和Qwen模型进行了基准测试。4. 借助StiPRompts研究LLMs对心理健康污名的处理。

Conclusion: 所提出的任务和评估方法揭示了不同LLMs在心理健康领域的潜力与不足，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Method: 选择10种开源大型语言模型，在8个经过翻译的数据集上进行评估，结合全面的错误分析，揭示其主要失败模式，探索分词效率与模型表现的关系。

Result: 发现小型模型和特定模型（如Mistral）在孟加拉语上的表现显著低于英语，而某些架构（如DeepSeek）展现出更强的跨语言稳健性。分词过度会降低性能，而高效简洁的分词则改善了模型表现。

Conclusion: 当前模型在孟加拉语上的种种不足表明需要改进数据集质量和多语言评估方法。本研究有助于推动对低资源语言的NLP研究，促进先进语言技术的普及。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家模型缺乏对专家重要性异质性的深入理解，急需找出对模型性能至关重要的专家子集。

Method: 通过分析open-source MoE模型的专家激活状态，识别出稀有但极端激活的SEs，并通过裁剪实验评估其对模型性能的影响，特别是对数学推理任务的作用。

Result: 发现SEs的分布具有模型特异性，且SEs裁剪严重影响注意力分布，引发模型性能下降。

Conclusion: MoE模型依赖于SEs以保证注意力分布的稳定性，裁剪SEs会严重干扰模型性能，尤其在数学推理任务中显著。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Method: 通过实验分析GPT-4o-mini在改写敏感内容时的行为，同时评估其分类句子敏感度的零样本能力，与传统方法对比性能。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o-mini能够系统性地将内容调整为更不敏感的类别，显著减少侮辱性和违禁词汇。

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini具备隐性内容调控的能力，并且在句子敏感度分类任务中显示出竞争力，展现了LLM在内容管理中的潜能。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在许多领域表现出色，但在音乐相关任务上的效果有限，因为训练数据中音乐领域知识较少。

Method: 提出MusT-RAG框架，引入音乐专用的向量数据库MusWikiDB进行信息检索，并在推理和微调中使用上下文信息优化模型对音乐领域的适应性。

Result: 实验显示，MusT-RAG在音乐领域适应方面优于传统微调方法，在内外部的音乐问答测试中均表现出一致改进；MusWikiDB在性能和计算效率上也优于通用的Wikipedia数据库。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG框架显著提升了大型语言模型在音乐文本问答领域的表现，为类似任务提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 任务导向对话（TOD）系统需要外部数据库支持以提升可解释性和可控性，但构建这类数据库的本体学需人工或有监督训练，较为复杂。提出能通过LLMs自动构建的解决方案以简化这一过程。

Method: 提出TeQoDO方法，结合LLMs的内在SQL编程能力和提示词中的对话理论，实现从零开始独立构建TOD本体，且无需人工监督。

Result: 实验显示TeQoDO相比迁移学习方法表现更佳，在对话状态追踪任务中也竞争力较强，并验证了对话理论的关键作用。同时其方法还适用于大规模数据集上的本体构建。

Conclusion: TeQoDO为LLMs在无需监督的情况下构建任务导向对话本体提供了切实可行的方案，是推动LLMs可解释性及本体学应用的一步重要进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准难以直接评估真实多模态情境下的规划能力，同时缺乏跨模态约束的衡量方法。

Method: 通过引入名为MPCC的新基准，设计三类真实任务（航班、日历、会议规划），并结合预算、时间、空间等复杂约束。根据任务复杂度划分为三级（简单、中等、困难），以分离约束复杂性与搜索空间扩展影响。

Result: 测试13种先进MLLM发现，闭源模型的成功规划率仅为21.3%，开源模型则低于11%。MLLM对约束复杂性表现出高敏感性，且传统的多模态提示方法在多约束场景中的表现失效。

Conclusion: 本研究系统化了多模态约束规划，提供了严格的评估框架，强调了在真实应用中提升具备约束感知的推理能力的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码器模型在进行语义信息提取时存在对双向注意力的修改影响，以及引入额外输入文本增加计算开销的问题。

Method: 通过轻量级BERT先将文本编码为单一上下文标记，并将其添加至LLM的输入序列中，同时结合特殊的嵌入方法提升语义抽取效果。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，实现最佳性能，同时减少序列长度85%和推理时间82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec无需改变LLM架构或增加显著计算负担，即可优化语义嵌入的性能和效率。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared

TL;DR: 本文探讨了本地部署的开源大语言模型在翻译领域作为替代云端AI解决方案的可行性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前云端AI聊天机器人在翻译研究广受关注，但隐私、安全性和公平接入性的担忧推动了对替代部署模式的探索。

Method: 评估三种安装在CPU平台上的开源模型性能，并与商用线上聊天机器人进行对比，重点考察功能性表现而非直接的翻译质量比较。

Result: 研究表明，本地部署尽管有挑战，但在数据控制、隐私保护和独立于云服务方面有显著优势。

Conclusion: 研究为推广AI技术的公平性和实用性提供了参考，尤其是针对个人译员和小型企业的需求。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MRGSEM-Sum框架提出了一种基于多关系图和结构熵最小化的无监督多文档摘要方法，解决了信息冗余和关系复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多文档摘要方法常局限于单关系图，并需要预定义的簇数量，无法充分捕捉丰富的关系信息或自适应地减少冗余。

Method: 提出MRGSEM-Sum框架，构建综合语义和语篇关系的多关系图，采用二维结构熵最小化算法进行聚类，自动确定最佳簇数，并引入基于位置感知的压缩机制生成摘要。

Result: 在Multi-News、DUC-2004、PubMed和WikiSum等四个基准数据集上，新方法的表现优于其他无监督方法，并在部分情况下接近监督模型与超大语言模型的水平。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum通过高效的图建模与压缩策略，生成了更具一致性和覆盖性的摘要，接近人类写作的质量。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Dense Passage Retrieval框架，专为阿拉伯语优化，通过创新的注意力相关性评分机制提升了问答任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语由于其复杂的词法结构、可选的重音符以及现代标准阿拉伯语与方言的共存，对自然语言处理和信息检索提出了特殊挑战。同时，尽管阿拉伯语全球重要性不断上升，但在自然语言处理研究与数据集资源中仍然代表性不足。

Method: 提出了新颖的注意力相关性评分（ARS）机制，替代了传统的交互机制，通过自适应评分函数更有效地建模问题和段落之间的语义相关性。此外，结合了预训练的阿拉伯语语言模型和架构优化。

Result: 方法显著提高了阿拉伯语问题的检索性能和排名准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种针对阿拉伯语优化的Dense Passage Retrieval框架，并是专为增强阿拉伯语信息检索能力的有效方法。代码也已公开发布，便于社区使用。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究引入主动性批判性思维，并提出GSM-MC与GSM-MCE基准，用于评估模型在不完全或误导条件下的数学推理能力，同时指出强化学习（RL）可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要关注于被动批判性思维，仅拒绝问题，而未主动寻求解决方案。为改进这点，研究推动AI能主动寻找关键信息，从而实现更有效的问题解决。

Method: 提出两项基准测试GSM-MC与GSM-MCE，用于检验AI的数学推理及其应对不完全且带有干扰信息的能力。此外，引入强化学习方法，增强模型的主动批判性思维能力。

Result: 通过实验，Qwen3和Llama系列模型在传统推理任务中表现优异，但在主动批判性思维场景下表现较差。然而，通过优化的强化学习算法，Qwen3-1.7B在GSM-MC测试中的准确率从0.15%提升至73.98%。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法显著提升了模型的主动批判性思维能力，有望让AI在与用户协作解决问题时表现更佳。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在企业环境中通过大型语言模型（LLMs）控制用户行为的方法，提出了三种建模策略以优先级生成不同角色的响应，并对其性能与鲁棒性进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在企业中的广泛应用，确保模型能够根据用户角色控制行为成为迫切需求。现有方法未能解决角色特定的访问约束问题，因此需要探索特定的解决方案。

Method: 提出了三种建模策略：基于BERT的分类器、基于LLM的分类器以及角色条件生成。构建了两个数据集，一个根据现有指令调优语料库生成，另一个模拟生成反映企业场景。评估模型在不同组织结构上的性能与鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法能有效生成符合角色权限的响应，并具有一定的抵抗提示注入、角色不匹配和越权尝试的能力。

Conclusion: 通过调整与优化，LLMs可以被应用于角色敏感的企业场景中，增强行为控制和安全性。因此在具体环境中的可行性具有实际意义。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决LLMs在临床决策辅助中面临的安全性和有效性验证的问题。

Method: 开发了CSEDB框架，包括30个标准和加权后果衡量的多维度评价体系，模拟真实场景，由32名专家医生设计和审核了2069个开放式问答，并评估了6种LLMs的表现。

Result: 发现一般LLMs在高风险场景中的表现下降显著，而针对医学领域优化的LLMs在安全性和有效性方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为评估医疗LLMs的临床应用提供了标准化评价基准，有助于进行比较分析、识别风险暴露和改进方向，同时推动LLMs在医疗中的安全有效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Med-R^3的框架，专注于在医学场景中联合优化知识检索与推理，通过渐进式强化学习设计提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多独立提升检索或推理能力，忽略了两者协同优化，同时过度依赖监督微调，限制了模型在新问题中的泛化能力，尤其医疗领域中相关方法的奖励函数设计不足以满足其特定需求。

Method: 提出了Med-R^3框架，依次通过逻辑推理能力培养、动态优化检索能力、以及检索与推理的联合优化，以渐进式强化学习方式全面增强模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，使用Med-R^3的模型性能显著提升，例如LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R^3超过GPT-4o-mini 3.93%，而Qwen2.5-14B结合Med-R^3提升13.53%。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化检索与推理，Med-R^3在医学领域中展现了领先的性能，提供了一种改进任务解决路径的有效方式。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在应对当前复杂文本生成模型带来的挑战，开发能够识别对抗性机器生成文本的检测方法。

Method: 基于对抗性文本展现显著峰态分布的观察，提出采用Student's t分布的重尾差异评分取代高斯分布正态化；实现通过与t分布的期望矩比较正则化文本似然分数来检测文本。

Result: 在RAID和HART数据集上的测试表明，T-Detect在多个领域相较强基线提供了最高提升3.9%的AUROC表现，并在Books域达到0.926的最先进性能。

Conclusion: T-Detect提供了一种理论有依据、鲁棒性更强的方法，有效检测对抗性文本，且代码已开源，具备实用价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Motivation: 当前Transformer模型存在噪声问题，差分注意力机制通过去噪操作改善了模型性能，DiffLoRA旨在参数高效的同时，保留差分注意力的优化效果。

Method: 通过将低秩适配器应用于正负注意力项上，结合差分注意力机制，设计参数高效的DiffLoRA方法，并在多种NLP任务中进行评估。

Result: 在大多数评估任务中，DiffLoRA表现不及其他参数高效的微调方法，但在特定领域如HumanEval任务中表现显著提升（+11分）。

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在参数高效设计上有一定价值，其在特定领域的表现值得进一步研究，并通过对模型微调后的注意力模式分析，揭示了其性能特点。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在仇恨言论检测和清理中均表现优异，达到了良好的效果。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

Motivation: 解决知识图谱中逻辑规则难以理解的问题，提高图谱的完整性和推理能力。

Method: 利用AMIE 3.5.1规则发现算法，从FB15k-237等数据集中提取逻辑规则，并采用多种提示方式（零样本、少样本、链式思维等）生成自然语言解释。

Result: 生成的自然语言解释在正确性和清晰度上表现出良好效果，但仍存在需要解决的挑战。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型有潜力帮助理解知识图谱中的逻辑规则，但未来还需进一步改进。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Motivation: 现有的QA基准评估方法间接评估了LLMs的问题解决能力，需要一种更全面准确的方法。

Method: 通过阶段性揭示问题信息，收集模型响应，以促使LLMs进行广义推理并评估其能力。

Result: 新方法改进了模型对比效果，并在多种数据集上验证其缩小现有评价方法中模型间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 本文发现传统QA评估方法高估了模型之间的性能差距，而所提新方法更能准确反映模型能力。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的推理能力与社会偏见的关系，通过实验探索推理与去偏两者的权衡，提出了一种均衡方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽然在各种任务和模态下表现出色，但存在推理能力提升导致社会偏见加重的问题，亟需找到稳定的去偏与推理增强的方案。

Method: 作者比较了三种基准去偏策略（监督微调SFT，知识蒸馏KD，基于规则的强化学习RL）在同等条件下的表现，并通过调整去偏样本与推理样本比例，研究推理与去偏之间的平衡点。

Result: 通过实验发现，采用1:4去偏样本与推理样本的比例并结合强化学习能够在减少10%偏见的同时，保留88%的推理准确率。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种兼顾公平性和推理能力的具体指导方案，推动多模态大语言模型更为平衡的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [167] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出当前AI系统在处理人类自然擅长的听觉任务上表现严重失常，并提出了一个涵盖七类挑战的听觉图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示当前AI系统在复杂听觉场景处理中的短板，弥补人机听觉差距，并推动人类水平机器听觉的发展。

Method: 设计了一个917项挑战的听觉图灵测试，并评估先进音频模型（包括GPT-4的音频能力和OpenAI的Whisper）的表现。

Result: 评估显示最好的模型仅能达到6.9%的准确率，而人类在类似任务上的成功率为52%，表明机器远远落后于人类。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统缺乏人类级别的选择性注意、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应能力，未来需整合物理听觉、选择性注意和上下文感知以提升多模态AI系统的听觉处理能力。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [168] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了论证一致性概念，并通过实验表明一致性在提高预测准确性方面的重要性，同时发现用户对该概念的自然接受度较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何将论证一致性作为一种机制，提升人类和大型语言模型（LLM）的预测准确性。

Method: 提出论证一致性的形式定义，通过对人类和LLM预测者的实验评估一致性对预测准确性的影响，并通过用户实验探索用户对一致性概念的接受度。

Result: 论证一致性能够滤除不一致的预测，从而显著提高人类和LLM预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 需要在基于论证的预测中引入过滤不一致意见的机制，以改进群体预测的结果。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [169] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Shapley值的责任衡量方法在本体介导查询中的复杂性问题，发现其复杂性随着本体语言能力的增强而增加，同时也探讨了结合复杂性的正负面结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基于责任衡量的query answer方法的计算复杂性，以了解如何高效量化事实对查询答案的贡献。

Method: 利用数据库背景下的现有结果，结合本体介导的查询框架，分析Shapley值基础上的最小支持集合加权求和（WSMS）计算的可行性与复杂性。

Result: 发现当本体语言具有较高表达能力时，WSMS的计算变得极为复杂，而对于DL-Lite等限制性本体语言，通过限制查询结构，仍能保持计算的可行性。

Conclusion: 通过研究不同复杂性条件下的WSMS计算，可以更好地理解责任衡量方法的适用范围，并为特定场景的优化提供理论支持。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [170] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的“分而治之”方法，用多次简化的部分MILP调用代替复杂的BaB调用，从而提高验证效率并减少计算复杂性。提出的SAS方法显著减少了二进制变量的使用，并通过一种混合方案提升了验证器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往方法在选择ReLU变量时效率不高，本研究旨在优化ReLU变量选择步骤，减少模型复杂性并提高验证器性能。

Method: 提出一种新的解决方案驱动的ReLU评分方法（SAS），并将BaB-SR和BaB-FSB分支功能调整为全局ReLU评分功能（GS）。结合α, β-CROWN和部分MILP的混合方法，用于逐步处理易解和难解实例。

Result: SAS方法比以往方法减少了约6倍二进制变量，同时保持准确率。实现的混合MILP验证器显著降低了未决实例数（减少40%），运行时间缩短且支持较大规模的CNN模型。

Conclusion: 通过新的变量选择方法和混合策略，验证器不仅提升了效率和准确率，还能够处理更大规模的网络结构，为神经网络的验证技术提供了新的思路。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Method: 通过提出AI自主性的三级模型，结合12条支持主张的论点、6条反驳及辩驳，并附上15项最近的误用案例证据来讨论问题。

Result: 文章强调完全自主AI存在高风险，特别是无责任监督的情况下可能带来严重问题。

Conclusion: 必须保持对AI的责任监督，防止自主性过高所引发的潜在威胁和伦理问题。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

TL;DR: 本文评估了当前最先进的大型语言模型在因果发现任务中的表现，提出模块化的上下文推理框架，在基准任务中取得了显著提升。

Motivation: 传统模型在因果发现任务中表现有限，特别是在数据扰动情况下，表现常接近随机性。本研究探讨是否能利用先进的推理模型实现更健壮的因果发现能力。

Method: 本文基于OpenAI的o系列模型和DeepSeek-R模型家族，提出了一种受到Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts方法启发的模块化上下文推理框架，并对模型的推理链长度和复杂性进行了分析。

Result: 相比传统基线模型，该方法在因果发现基准任务Corr2Cause上取得了接近三倍的性能提升。同时，通过定性和定量方法分析，验证了推理模型和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 先进的推理模型尽管已展现强大能力，但结合精心设计的上下文推理框架更能全面发挥其潜力，为跨领域的因果发现提供通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Conclusion: 因果解释方法兼具形式严谨性和对图像分类器的适配性，与黑箱算法完美结合，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了传统信任评估中资源消耗高与优化不足的矛盾，为大规模系统中的分布式协作提供了支持。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

### [181] [MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633)
*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新型的策略引导的人工智能辅助记忆召回方法，通过将原始查询转化为富含提示的查询，帮助人们回忆记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的记忆召回方法受限于内存模块容量，难以帮助人们完整回忆。因此，需要一种能主动激活相关记忆的策略，以提升召回性能。

Method: 设计了一个5W召回地图，将记忆查询分类为五种典型场景，并定义了十五种召回策略模式。使用层次召回树和蒙特卡洛树搜索算法优化策略选择和响应生成，并开发MemoCue系统，结合微调多种开源大语言模型实现。

Result: 实验表明，MemoCue在召回灵感方面比基于LLM的方法提升了17.74%，并通过人类评估证明了其在记忆召回应用中的优势。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效提升了人工智能在记忆召回中的表现，对人机交互领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在训练过程中对学生最适合的问题的探索效率较低，需要改进模型的探索机制。

Method: 提出了Ranking Alignment Recommendation（RAR），通过融入协作思想提升探索效率，并适用于任何基于RL的问题推荐系统。

Result: 实验结果显示RAR显著提高了推荐性能。

Conclusion: RAR提供了一种创新的探索机制，可高效推荐问题并提升学习效果。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in
https://github.com/wuming29/RAR.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法完全捕捉代理在复杂互动环境中的长期自主推理能力，因此需要更适合的工具来刺激这种能力的发展。

Method: 提出TextQuests作为基准，基于交互式小说游戏，限制外部工具使用，迫使AI依赖内在的长时间推理能力进行问题解决。

Result: TextQuests衡量了LLM代理在无需外界工具的情况下，独立解决问题及进行长期上下文推理的能力。

Conclusion: TextQuests为评估AI自主推理和问题解决能力提供了一个可靠的测试环境。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在数学理论证明上表现不佳，主要由于其基于自然语言的训练缺乏明确的监督信号。通过使用像Lean这样的专用领域语言，可以借助形式验证提供清晰的训练反馈信号，从而有效提升推理能力。

Method: 提出了Seed-Prover模型，能够通过Lean反馈和自我总结，迭代改进推理过程，并在测试阶段提供深层和广泛的推理策略。此外，开发了Seed-Geometry，一个专用于几何推理的引擎，与现有几何引擎相比具有更强性能。

Result: Seed-Prover模型成功证明了78.1%的IMO数学问题、完全解决了MiniF2F测验，并在PutnamBench上超越了50%的表现，远超之前技术。同时，Seed-Geometry在几何问题求解中超越此前成果。

Conclusion: 这一研究显著提升了通过强化学习和长链式推理进行形式化数学推理的能力，为自动数学推导提供了新的高效路径，同时展现了在未来领域应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: 在可验证推理任务中，生成的数据在MATH500、AMC23、AIME24和GPQA-Diamond数据集上的表现显著优于现有训练集；在不可验证任务上，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard评估中超过了人工和标准自我指导提示。

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct方法通过生成高质量合成数据，显著增强了大语言模型在推理和任务学习中的表现优势，可作为下一代LLM训练的数据增强策略。

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0

Motivation: 当前AI领域的单任务单代理模型存在扩展性和通用性不足的问题，需要更强大的通用推理代理架构。

Method: 提出SimuRA架构，通过LLM实现概念丰富的语言潜在空间的世界模型，结合基于世界模型的模拟规划进行推理。

Result: 在复杂的网页浏览任务中，SimuRA将成功率提升从0%增加到32.2%，基于世界模型的规划比自回归规划提升高达124%。

Conclusion: SimuRA展示了世界模型模拟作为推理范式的显著优势，首次让基于LLM的单一通用代理模型具备在多种环境下表现出超强智能的潜力。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Motivation: 脑老化的预测对临床和计算神经科学具有重要意义，但受限于高维度数据、年龄间结构细微变化和个体化模式，这一任务仍有较大挑战。

Method: 该模型通过自回归方式估计未来扫描的离散Token映射，将之前和未来扫描的嵌入作为输入，并使用交叉注意机制结合扫描年龄和目标年龄进行生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，NeuroAR在中老年和青少年人群中的图像保真度上优于现有生成模型（如LDM和GAN），并通过预训练的年龄预测器验证了其生成图像的逼真性和一致性。

Conclusion: NeuroAR展示了对个体化脑老化轨迹建模的高保真能力，明显优于当前主流模型，提供了先进的脑老化模拟方法。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Method: 在实验中，提取了按键时序和节奏特征，设计多种分类器场景，包括认知感知（Cognition-Aware）和非认知感知（Cognition-Unaware）两种设置，研究各特征的检测表现。

Result: 时序特征在认知感知场景效果更优，节奏特征在跨认知场景泛化表现更佳。此外，检测转录和改编ChatGPT生成内容的任务对模型和人类评估者都更具挑战性，其中，模型显著优于人类表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，按键动态特征能可靠地用于检测复杂认知需求及不同写作策略下的大语言模型辅助写作行为。

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Motivation: MLP 存在解释性差、固定激活函数、不易捕获局部或高频特征等问题，而 KANs 可以克服这些局限性。

Method: 本文通过将 KANs 的进展分类为数据驱动学习、物理启发建模和深度算子学习三个视角，研究其架构设计、训练策略、应用效果及与 MLP 的对比。

Result: KANs 在准确性、收敛性和频谱表示方面较传统 MLP 具有稳定的改进，能够更好地捕捉复杂动态。

Conclusion: KANs 具有增强的灵活性和解释性，但仍需在计算效率、理论保证、超参数调优和算法复杂性方面进行研究，以提升其鲁棒性、可扩展性及物理一致性。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Conclusion: 研究成果显著提升了多灾害预警系统的解释性和适用性，促进跨学科信任并改善气候风险管理决策。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Conclusion: FedCVD++实现了将非参数模型成功应用于联邦学习的第一例，提供了一个隐私保护和高扩展性的多机构健康预测解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

Method: 使用多模态深度学习框架GSM-UTCI，将地表形态、高精度土地覆盖数据和每小时气象条件结合，并使用FiLM动态调节空间特征进行预测。

Result: GSM-UTCI在准确度上达到了近物理模型水平（R2=0.9151，MAE=0.41°C），推断速度显著加快至五分钟内完成城市范围预测，并能有效评估绿化策略的降温效果。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是一个可扩展的高精度决策支持工具，用于城市气候适应规划及针对性的绿化场景评价。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

Result: 揭示当前使用人类测试评估AI表现的缺陷，并提供建设性改进建议。

Conclusion: 人类测试与AI特性不匹配，强烈呼吁开发适合AI的评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态潜在空间在任务特定AI模型中的逆向能力及更广泛的实用性，提出了一种基于优化方法的框架来探索从目标输出推测输入特征的逆向任务。结果表明，这些潜在空间在逆向映射中缺乏语义意义和感知一致性，强调了研究可解释和可逆多模态潜在空间的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态AI模型在特定任务上的正向能力（如文本转图像生成、音频转文本转录）表现出色，但其逆向能力的潜力尚未深入研究，作者希望探究和拓展这一潜能。

Method: 提出了一种基于优化的框架，在文本-图像和文本-音频两种多模态环境中进行双向应用，以研究模型构建输入特征逆向的可能性及其表现。

Result: 实验验证了虽然优化可以引导模型完成某些逆向任务（如生成符合目标文本描述的图像或正确转录为目标的音频等），但生成结果的感知质量和语义逻辑常常混乱甚至无意义。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间主要为特定正向任务优化，缺乏支持稳健、解释性强的逆向映射所需的结构，需要进一步研究开发真正语义丰富且可逆的多模态潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

TL;DR: 提出KLLM，这是一种硬件-软件协同设计框架，采用K-Means量化技术优化LLM推理，显著提高了速度和能效。

Method: 引入KLLM框架，包括基于索引的计算方案以高效处理K-Means量化数据，并设计Orizuru引擎用于高效在线识别激活数据的极值。

Result: 相比A100 GPU和Atom，KLLM在推理速度上分别提升了9.67倍和7.03倍，能效提升分别达到229.50倍和150.21倍。

Conclusion: KLLM框架在高效执行LLM推理方面显示出巨大潜力，成功克服了传统低精度量化方法的局限性并显著提高了性能和能效。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前急症监护病房（ICU）中使用万古霉素治疗严重革兰氏阳性感染会带来高肾毒性风险，但及时预测肾损伤较为困难。

Method: 分析了MIMIC-IV数据库中10,288名使用万古霉素的ICU患者数据，结合多种特征选择方法和算法进行预测并通过SHAP等工具评估模型可解释性。

Result: CatBoost模型表现最佳，达到AUROC 0.818，敏感性为0.800，模型识别出磷、胆红素、镁等关键预测因素，并展示剂量反应关系。

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的预测模型，有助于万古霉素相关肌酐升高的早期风险识别，从而支持关键护理中的及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Motivation: 现有的断裂行为预测方法存在数据集局限性、模型稳健性不足和泛化能力不佳的问题。同时，基于物理的模拟器需要大量计算资源且方法专用化严重。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between

relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness

of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个无培训的多模态文档理解系统DocsRay，它通过伪目录生成和分层检索增强生成方法提高文档解析效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前复杂多模态文档的理解困难，主要由于其结构不一致性及训练数据的匮乏，因此需要一种无需专门训练的新方法来高效解析这类文档。

Method: DocsRay通过整合三个关键方法实现文档理解：(1) 使用基于提示的大型语言模型生成层次化的伪目录；(2) 利用多模态大型语言模型能力实现零样本多模态分析，将文档元素转化为统一的文本表示；(3) 一个两阶段分层检索系统，显著减少了检索复杂度。

Result: 在平均49.4页、20,971字节的文档上测试，DocsRay将查询延迟降低了45%，从3.89秒减至2.12秒。在MMLongBench-Doc基准测试中，DocsRay-Pro精度达到64.7%，显著超过之前的技术水平。

Conclusion: DocsRay通过无训练的方法显著提升了多模态文档的解析效率和精度，为复杂文档处理提供了简单而高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在生成文本时容易产生语境性幻觉，这些不基于上下文的内容会降低生成质量与可靠性，亟需有效的检测和缓解方案。

Method: 作者提出一种观察模型，该模型通过单次前向传递和对残差流的线性探测，可准确识别幻觉文本。利用梯度与激活方法进一步定位到稀疏的晚层MLP活动，并证明通过操控线性方向可以显著影响生成器的幻觉率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，生成文本中幻觉的低维追踪信号与特定MLP子电路相联系，这种可操作性为更有效的检测和缓解方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有影响力驱动遗忘方法计算开销大、难以实际应用的难题，通过构建记忆和遗忘的理论连接，优化机器遗忘过程。

Method: 提出了影响近似遗忘(IAU)算法，将遗忘问题转化为更高效的增量学习问题，使用梯度优化代替昂贵的Hessian矩阵计算。

Conclusion: IAU算法从理论和实际验证了增量学习与遗忘的关系，提供了一种高效且可靠的机器遗忘方法。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统使用固定的协作图结构，限制了适应性和性能，因此需要更灵活的框架。

Method: 提出DynaSwarm框架，结合A2C强化学习优化图结构，并通过动态图选择器基于样本特性动态调整图结构。

Result: DynaSwarm在问答、数学推理和编码任务上超越了单智能体和其他多智能体系统基线。

Conclusion: 样本意识的结构灵活性对大语言模型中的多智能体系统设计尤为重要。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Result: 发现样本的学习难度与脆弱性之间存在强相关性；最终模型中隐私高风险的样本，其风险大多在训练早期就已确定。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了隐私风险在训练中的动态变化过程，为隐私保护的模型训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个易于创建序列建模的工具，使模型既能逐层（如教师强迫训练）又能逐步（如自回归采样）运行，同时减少流处理和并行序列处理中的常见错误。

Method: 通过定义层的时间状态表示与步骤方法（如Transformer缓存、卷积缓存、RNN隐藏状态），并测试验证其在有状态和无状态调用中的一致性。

Result: 所提API促进了复杂模型的流化，即使模型来自简单的流媒体组件也能保证正确性；并在JAX与TensorFlow2中实现。

Conclusion: 提供了一个强大的、易用的API来简化生产级序列模型的构建，同时降低出现错误的可能性并提升流模型的性能。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型基于过程奖励的算法TP-GRPO，以改进大规模推理模型（LRMs）在数学推理任务中的学习效率，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有强化学习方法中，由于仅依赖稀疏结果奖励而导致优化效率低的问题。

Method: 通过引入过程奖励模型（PRMs），采用一种内在信号驱动的生成过程评估机制，在思路级别对解决方案的正确性进行分步评估，并将连续的正确/错误步骤整合为统一的“思路”单元。同时，提出能力自适应奖励机制动态平衡探索与利用。最终研发出一种新的基于过程奖励的强策略优化算法TP-GRPO。

Result: 在包含1.5B和7B参数的LRMs上的实验表明，与仅基于结果的奖励方法相比，TP-GRPO用更少的训练样本达到了更高的问题解决准确性。

Conclusion: 结构良好的过程奖励能显著加速LRM在数学推理任务中的优化效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出CostCert，一种新颖、可扩展且精确的基于投票机制的认证恢复防御方法，用于提升深度学习系统在对抗性补丁攻击下的鲁棒性认证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的认证恢复技术无法精确地对位于top-k预测标签内的唯一真实标签进行认证，且现有方法容易受攻击预算影响，或者受到组合爆炸问题的限制。

Method: 设计了一种新的方案，通过验证攻击预算是否足以覆盖攻击者无法控制的最小额外票数，从而排除真实标签是否仍位于top-k预测标签内，并避免了成对比对和组合爆炸问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，当补丁大小为96时，CostCert的认证准确率可达57.3%，显著优于当前最先进技术PatchGuard（认证准确率降至零）。

Conclusion: CostCert在对抗性补丁攻击防护方面具备显著提升的性能，并能以较高的可扩展性和认证精度保障深度学习系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Conclusion: 设置合适的初始条件可将平衡库存时的折扣成本降至最低，证明了该方法对动态定价问题的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: PLARE展示了通过大规模视觉语言模型替代传统奖励函数设计的潜力，为离线强化学习提供了更加高效和实用的途径。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a system for detecting adulteration in coconut
milk, utilizing infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning-based proposed
system comprises three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时空状态空间神经算子（ST-SSM），用于学习时间相关偏微分方程（PDE）的解算子，具有参数高效性和建模灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是针对时间相关偏微分方程，研发一种高效、灵活的算子学习架构，同时提供理论支持。

Method: 通过将空间和时间维度进行分解，使用结构化状态空间模型分别建模时间演化和空间交互，同时建立SSM与神经算子的理论联系并证明统一的普适性定理。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个PDE基准上优于其他方案（如之字扫描和并行处理），并在参数使用量更少的情况下表现出色。

Conclusion: 维度分解的算子学习方法在有效性与泛化性上具有优势，并且为PDE建模提供了理论保障。

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

*Yinhui Ma,Tomomasa Yamasaki,Zhehui Wang,Tao Luo,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Coflex的新型硬件感知神经网络结构搜索（HW-NAS）框架，通过结合稀疏高斯过程（SGP）与多目标贝叶斯优化，实现了高效硬件设计与网络性能联合优化的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法面临巨大的搜索空间和高计算成本等挑战，限制了其实用性。

Method: Coflex框架通过稀疏高斯过程（SGP）和多目标贝叶斯优化结合，使用稀疏诱导点将GP内核复杂度从训练样本数量的三次方降至近线性，从而降低计算开销并保证预测精度。

Result: Coflex在多个基准测试中表现优异，特别是在加速器特定架构上的实验中实现了1.9x至9.5x的计算加速，同时在网络精度和能量延迟积（Energy-Delay-Product）上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Coflex证明了其在硬件感知神经架构搜索中的高效性，同时显著降低了计算负担，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推理方法通常忽略因果关系的结构性不确定性，研究此问题对提升决策质量尤为重要。

Method: 提出了在因果结构存在不确定性时，采用贝叶斯模型平均的方法，并分析了其适用的条件和理论证明。

Result: 证明了该方法在结构性不确定性中可优化决策，并通过模拟演示现代因果发现方法能够定量化这些不确定性。

Conclusion: 建议的框架可与现有的因果推理方法互补，更好地应对实践中常被忽视的不确定性问题。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

### [228] [Directional Ensemble Aggregation for Actor-Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23501)
*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种名为方向性集成聚合（DEA）的方法，用于改进连续控制任务中离线强化学习的Q值估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过保守的集成策略（如取最小值）减轻Q值估计的高估偏差，但这些静态规则存在信息丢失的问题，且无法适应特定任务需求。

Method: 提出方向性集成聚合（DEA），通过引入两个可学习的方向性参数，分别调节评论者的保守性和引导行动者的策略探索。参数学习是基于加权贝尔曼误差进行的，其中权重仅基于贝尔曼误差的方向。

Result: 在多种连续控制任务和学习模式（如交互式和样本高效模式）下，验证了DEA优于传统静态集成策略。

Conclusion: DEA通过数据驱动的方法动态调整保守性和探索性，从而改进了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言中验证时间与证明长度之间的关系，以及对复杂性类分离问题的影响。

Method: 通过证明验证器权衡定理，从理论上分析验证时间从 \(f(n)\) 减到 \(g(n)\) 的代价—证明需要的长度至少为 \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\)。

Result: 研究表明验证器权衡定理可以用于分析复杂性类之间的猜测分离（如 \(NP\) 和 \(EXP\) 的关系），并应用于自然问题如字符串的周期性和旋转检测。

Conclusion: 将 \(P\) vs. \(NP\) 问题与子线性证明的存在性建立联系，为深入了解复杂性理论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Motivation: 探索在具有重尾噪声条件下，边界固定剪裁水平的高概率收敛性如何与差分隐私机制结合。

Method: 提出DP-Clipped-SGD固定剪裁水平下的高概率收敛性分析，适用于凸和非凸平滑优化问题，并基于中心α阶矩假设来处理重尾噪声。

Result: 证明了方法可以在固定剪裁水平下以优于现有方法的速率收敛至最优解的邻域，并提供了对收敛速度和隐私保证之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 本文首次以固定剪裁水平分析DP-Clipped-SGD收敛性，解决了与差分隐私机制结合的难题，为重尾噪声下的优化提供了新见解。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了利用合成边界数据（SBD）缓解灾难性遗忘的新方法，并通过一种经验混合框架集成实际和合成数据，显著提升CL任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经验回放方法在灾难性遗忘问题中的效果有限，主要由于存储样本分布稀疏，导致决策边界过简化。因此，亟需一种使模型边界更稳定、更少遗忘的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种经验混合框架，包括两个核心组件：（1）采用差分隐私噪声机制，在特征表示中注入批噪声生成SBD；（2）通过端到端的训练策略，同时利用存储的关键样本和SBD进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上的实验验证了方法的有效性，与九种基线方法相比，分别提高了10%、6%和13%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 通过引入动态合成边界数据以及经验混合框架，该方法改善了灾难性遗忘问题，为CL模型提供了更优的表现。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Method: 对LoRA、DoRA和GaLore在处理分布转换和未见类时的性能进行了基准测试，比较了它们与传统微调方法在模型性能与计算成本上的表现，并分析了在不同秩维度下的效率。

Result: PEFT方法在深度可分离卷积架构中的内存效率仅为在大型语言模型中表现的一半，但适配了边缘环境优化的卷积架构后，其计算成本可下降至95%。

Conclusion: 基于硬件约束、性能需求和应用需求，提供了在边缘设备应用中选择PEFT方法的有益指导。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power
consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range

advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze
inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for
our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our
results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy

Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements

Motivation: 解决高维分类任务中特征选择问题，特别是考虑到模型稀疏性和可解释性的重要性。

Method: 将特征选择视为组合优化问题，用模拟退火算法进行全局搜索，并通过费舍判别比指导优化。

Result: 在大规模数据集测试中，SA-FDR比贪心算法能选择更紧凑的特征子集，同时保持高预测精度。

Conclusion: SA-FDR能够捕捉贪心方法经常遗漏的特征间依赖性，为高维设置下需要稀疏性和可解释性的模型提供了一种灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently

### [238] [EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23600)
*Yu-Tang Chang,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过引入基于能量的深度学习求解器EB-gMCR，本文提出了一种新方法用于信号分离分析，旨在在大规模数据集上实现高效且可靠的化学和生物信号解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多元曲线分辨方法（MCR）依赖矩阵分解，难以应对数据集规模或成分数量增长所带来的扩展性和可靠性问题，且对成分数量的先验信息要求高。

Method: 本文将MCR重新表述为生成过程（gMCR），并利用基于能量的深度学习求解方法EB-gMCR，通过可微分的门控网络从一个大候选池中自动选择和优化出最小必要成分集，并估算其浓度。

Result: 在噪声合成数据集上，EB-gMCR在检测多达256个潜在源时保持R^2 >= 0.98，且成分估算能接近真实值；低噪声下，EB-gMCR实现了R^2 >= 0.99和几乎准确的成分计数。

Conclusion: 通过结合高容量生成建模与硬性成分选择，EB-gMCR实现了高效大规模信号分离，并支持通过插件函数引入化学先验知识，适应于不同领域的研究。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新方法，结合层级强化学习和消息传递来提升多智能体层级策略学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的分布式MARL方法虽然具有扩展性，但难以解决部分可观测性和非站性问题，而现有层级策略的优化在多智能体系统中的应用仍有较大限制。

Method: 采用阶层HRL框架，基于层级图结构实现规划和智能体间协调，设计了一种新的奖励分配方法，以最大化上层优势函数为目标来训练下层策略。

Conclusion: 通过整合消息传递和层级结构，有效提高了多智能体系统的规划和协调能力，为领域提供了一种新颖有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Conclusion: 该研究证明，通过深度学习和概率建模可以显著提高临床试验患者入组预测的准确性，有助于试验的有效规划和执行。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Conclusion: L-GTA 提供了一种更高效的数据增强方法，有助于改进时间序列分析任务的表现。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了softmax注意力机制的优越性及其与线性注意力的关系，并解释了为什么softmax具有更高的表现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者希望理解为什么softmax注意力相较于线性注意力表现更优，并揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 通过推导softmax注意力的递归形式，将其表述为一种循环神经网络（RNN），从而能够分离比较softmax的各组成部分作用。

Result: 研究发现了softmax注意力不同于线性注意力的关键点，并揭示了softmax在表达能力上的优势与其特定组件的交互有关。

Conclusion: softmax注意力具有更高的表达能力，其复杂性和表现优越性来源于核心机制的细致设计，这解释了其在transformer架构中不可替代的地位。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: OptiGradTrust和FedBN-Prox能有效应对联邦学习中的攻击和数据异质性问题，显著提升模型的可靠性和收敛性能，提供了一种新的联邦学习防御解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种可扩展的高效缓存解决方案，在高访问量场景中应用时不影响用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Motivation: 扩散策略在在线强化学习中表现出色，但其通过迭代采样进行推理时效率较低，研究希望通过新算法改进推理速度。

Method: 提出一种名为Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD)的在线强化学习算法，通过利用分布方差和单步采样离散误差的理论联系，实现了无需额外训练的单步采样推理，并提供了基于Flow Policy和MeanFlow Policy两种实现方案。

Result: 算法在MuJoCo基准测试中表现良好，与扩散策略基线类似，但推理时的函数评估次数减少了数百倍，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: FPMD算法在保持性能的同时，大幅提升了推理效率，为在线强化学习扩散策略提供了一种更实际可用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff框架在稳健性、对不同癌症类型的通用性方面优异，展示了其在微生物组数据填补中的潜力。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少主动学习中因标注错误导致的误分类，并提高效率，从而更快地达到期望精度。

Conclusion: 内部因素（如心情和疲劳）对标注性能的影响显著，本研究通过知识推荐系统有效减小了标注误差，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Result: CODA在26个基准任务上验证了其有效性，与现有方法相比，显著减少了70%以上用于发现最优模型的标注努力。

Conclusion: CODA显著提升了主动模型选择的效率，为机器学习模型选择提供了一种更具成本效益的方法。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PancreasDG，一个大规模多中心3D MRI胰腺分割数据集，用于研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题，并提出了一种基于解剖学不变性的半监督方法，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺分割是腹部成像的主要挑战，其复杂性源于器官小且形状不规则、低T1对比度以及周围脂肪和器官的影响。此外，胰腺在公共跨领域基准中代表性不足，尽管其在癌症早期检测、手术和糖尿病研究中具有临床重要性。

Method: 研究设计了PancreasDG数据集，包含来自6个机构的563份MRI扫描，并基于双盲双遍标注协议生成像素级胰腺掩码。研究分析了数据集中的跨中心和跨序列变化，并提出了一种基于解剖学不变性的半监督分割方法。

Result: 提出的半监督方法在跨序列分割中实现了61.63%的Dice分数提升，在两个测试中心上达到了87.00%的Dice分数，显著超越当前最先进的领域泛化技术。

Conclusion: PancreasDG数据集为医学影像中的领域泛化研究提供了新的基准，同时该论文提出的技术在复杂变异条件下的胰腺分割表现出显著优势，为领域泛化研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
