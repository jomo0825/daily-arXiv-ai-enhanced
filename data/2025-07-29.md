Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为调节自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的模型，用于增强低光图像，改进图像细节和自然对比度，同时保持色彩分布的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光条件下图像质量下降会影响影像对比度、细节清晰度及噪声水平，因此需要一种高效的图像增强方法。

Method: 基于分析低光图像的色彩亮度，计算出自适应的伽马系数，无需人工干预即可自动调整伽马值，适配不同光照水平的图像增强需求。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明TAGC模型有效改善了低光图像，同时保留细节、自然对比度与正确的色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC模型是一种高效的低光图像处理方案，适用于夜间监控、医学影像质量提升和低光环境下的摄影等多种应用。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [2] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新方法，通过控制深度网络中前景和背景特征差异，以解决医学影像分割中因数据增加引起的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因数据池化或新增数据导致的分布偏移问题，即“数据新增困境”，提升医学影像分割效果。

Method: 基于因果框架，提出控制深度网络各层前景与背景特征差异的新方法，优化特征表示。

Result: 该方法在五个数据集（包括一个新创建的超声波数据集）上实现了医学影像分割的最新性能，生成的分割图更精细准确。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效提升数据新增情境下的医学影像分割性能，且具备通用性。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network (T-MPEDNet)，用于CT扫描中肝脏和肿瘤的自动分割，取得了优异的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏及其肿瘤的精确自动分割对快速诊断和治疗方案设计至关重要，但因肿瘤异质性及患者间肝脏特征多样性，面临巨大挑战。

Method: 提出T-MPEDNet网络，基于渐进式编码解码结构和Transformer动态注意机制，同时利用多尺度特征和形态学边界优化，提升分割精度。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet在肝脏及肿瘤分割方面均优于12种最新技术，DSC分别达到97.6%、89.1%及98.3%、83.3%。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效且可靠的肝脏及其肿瘤自动分割框架，在CT扫描中表现优越。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

### [4] [SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592)
*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SurgPIS，一个针对外科手术工具的统一模型，用以解决工具部件分割和实例分割的联合任务问题，并通过部分监督学习策略提升性能，在多个数据集上实现了领先的分割表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对手术工具的分割方法只能单独处理实例级或部件级分割，未能结合两者，这限制了自动化手术的进一步发展。

Method: 设计SurgPIS模型，将手术工具分割定义为部件意识的实例分割问题，基于transformer的mask分类，并通过部件与实例的直接关联解决任务统一性。同时利用部分监督学习策略，结合不同标注的数据集进行联合训练，采用师生框架提升一致性。

Result: SurgPIS在多个数据集上进行了实验，结果显示其不仅在部件实例分割中达到领先性能，还优于现有方法在实例分割、部件分割和工具级语义分割任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 通过引入SurgPIS模型，这项研究展示了在有限标注条件下实现手术工具多维度分割优秀表现的可能性，为未来机器人辅助手术的自动化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

### [5] [Object-centric Video Question Answering with Visual Grounding and Referring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19599)
*Haochen Wang,Qirui Chen,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Yao Hu,Weidi Xie,Stratis Gavves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的VideoLLM模型，通过引入STOM模块和VideoInfer数据集，显著提升了视频问答及目标分割的能力，并在多项基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的VideoLLM模型主要局限于高层次理解且仅支持文本响应，缺乏处理对象中心的多轮交互能力。

Method: 引入了一种支持视频对象引用与输出定位的VideoLLM模型，提出了STOM（空间-时间覆盖模块）进行视觉提示传播，同时构建了VideoInfer数据集，用于对象中心的视频推理。

Result: 模型在VideoInfer及其他12个基准测试任务（涵盖视频问答与目标分割）上都显著优于现有模型，证明了其实用性及鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了VideoLLM在多模态理解及对象中心任务中的性能，为未来视频大语言模型的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

*Sheethal Bhat,Bogdan Georgescu,Adarsh Bhandary Panambur,Mathias Zinnen,Tri-Thien Nguyen,Awais Mansoor,Karim Khalifa Elbarbary,Siming Bayer,Florin-Cristian Ghesu,Sasa Grbic,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了Exemplar Med-DETR，一种创新的多模态对比检测器，在不同医学影像模式和任务中实现了优秀性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在学习类特定特征上存在困难，无法适应不同任务和影像模式的需求，尤其在由致密乳腺组织遮挡病变的乳腺X光中面临挑战。

Method: 提出一种基于特征的检测方法：Exemplar Med-DETR。方法结合跨注意力机制和类特定样本特征，采用迭代训练策略进行多模态对比检测。

Result: 在四个公开数据集的三种影像模式中均达成最佳性能指标。特定结果如：越南致密乳腺X光达到mAP为0.7（肿块）和0.55（钙化点），绝对提升16个百分点；在中国外分布乳腺队列中的检测性能提升两倍；在胸部X光和冠状动脉造影的mAP分别提高4和7个百分点。

Conclusion: 方法具有显著提升不同医学影像中鲁棒和通用检测能力的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决医学图像分割方法比较困难的问题，并满足标准化与定制化工具的需求。

Method: 开发并扩展了MIST工具的后处理模块，其中包括多种变换操作（例如移除/替换小物体、提取最大连通区域及形态学操作等），支持用户自定义策略和模块组合。

Result: 通过在BraTS 2025挑战中的实验验证了三种后处理策略的性能，结果显示MIST可快速进行实验和优化，提升最终分割质量。

Conclusion: MIST作为开源、可扩展的工具，在医学图像分割研究中提升了实验可重复性和可扩展性，支持高质量分割的产生。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了名为SynPAIN的大规模合成数据集，用于解决痛觉检测中的种族、年龄及性别方面的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于沟通能力受限的患者（如患有痴呆症的老年人）的痛觉评估存在困难，优化自动化痛觉检测系统具有重要意义。现有数据集存在种族、隐私和年龄群体代表不足等问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 研究利用商业生成式人工智能工具创建了一个包含10,710张合成面部表情图像的数据集，涵盖不同种族、年龄和性别，并验证了其痛觉面部表情的临床有效性。

Result: 实验表明，SynPAIN能识别现有痛觉检测模型中的算法偏差，并通过数据增强提高实际临床数据的痛觉检测精度，实现了7.0%的性能提升。

Conclusion: SynPAIN填补了在老年人痛觉评估研究中的关键空白，为测量与减轻算法偏差提供了框架，并公开提供数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过直接偏好优化(DPO)在半监督学习框架中高效微调紧凑型视觉语言模型（2B-3B参数），并在电商属性预测任务中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的监督微调面临高成本问题，因此研究更高效的半监督方法以充分利用未标注数据来提升电商领域属性预测的性能具有重要意义。

Method: 使用一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的半监督微调方法，通过对未标注样本生成优劣对比选取自洽链策略，结合低秩适配器模块实现高效参数调整，并反复更新模型权重。

Result: 该方法在十二个电商领域中取得了显著优于传统监督模型的性能，并显示其精度还随着未标注数据量的增加而进一步提高。

Conclusion: 通过DPO方法实现了利用大规模未标注数据提升模型表现的可能，为低标注成本的高效电商领域图像属性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Conclusion: DeepJIVE 是一种有效的多模态数据分析工具，可以用于高维数据和非线性结构的联合与个性化变异分析。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Conclusion: 本文提出的uQRPCA和uQRPCA+提供了一种在色彩视频中进行高效目标分割和背景恢复的有效方法，显著提升性能并具有实际价值，代码已公开以便社区使用和验证。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at
https://github.com/Ruchtech/uQRPCA

*Jinsu Yoo,Sooyoung Jeon,Zanming Huang,Tai-Yu Pan,Wei-Lun Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究如何在RAST-Stereo框架下利用LiDAR数据提高立体匹配准确性，提出并验证了用于稀疏LiDAR点的预填充方法，并提出了GRAFT-Stereo体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏LiDAR点情况下提高立体匹配精度的有效方法。

Method: 在稀疏LiDAR点条件下，通过信号处理视角，提出了对初始视差图的预填充方法，结合早期特征融合优化策略，最终开发了GRAFT-Stereo方法。

Result: GRAFT-Stereo在各种数据集中，在稀疏LiDAR点条件下表现显著优于当前方法。

Conclusion: 预填充策略和早期特征融合可显著提升稀疏LiDAR引导下的立体匹配性能，提出的方法为未来研究提供启发。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视频实例分割方法LOMM，通过最新对象记忆系统显著提升了长期对象跟踪效果，并在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上取得了54.0的先进AP分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视频实例分割中由于对象频繁出现和消失而导致的身份不一致和无法准确跟踪的问题。

Method: 核心是最新对象记忆（LOM），通过显式建模每帧中对象的存在来保持最新状态跟踪；还引入了解耦对象关联（DOA）策略，分别处理新出现和已存在对象以确保匹配准确性和身份一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上达到了54.0的AP分数，优于传统方法，并证明其在动态场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: LOMM方法显著改善了视频实例分割中的长期对象跟踪能力，是一种在动态和复杂场景中表现优异的新型解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

### [16] [MoFRR: Mixture of Diffusion Models for Face Retouching Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19770)
*Jiaxin Liu,Qichao Ying,Zhenxing Qian,Sheng Li,Runqi Zhang,Jian Liu,Xinpeng Zhang*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的面部修复任务（FRR）和相应的解决方案MoFRR，专注于恢复经过精修的面部图像的原始样貌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上面部润饰的广泛使用引发了对于面部图像真实性的担忧，然而关于如何从润饰图像准确恢复原始面容的问题尚未解决。

Method: 提出了MoFRR方法，一种基于扩散模型的解决方案，结合了专门处理不同润饰类型的专家模块和通用处理模块，采用双分支结构（低频和高频处理）进行图像修复，辅以一个新设计的迭代失真评估模块（IDEM）和高频细节交叉注意机制（HFCAM）。

Result: 在一个新构建的数据集RetouchingFFHQ++上进行了大量实验，验证了所提方法在面部修复任务（FRR）中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了MoFRR可以有效恢复经过复杂润饰操作的面部图像，验证了其在新任务中的潜力和优势。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了MAE的自监督学习特性并提出了一种改进的方法，提高了学习效率和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析MAE的学习机制及其问题所在，进一步提升其学习效率和表现。

Method: 通过分析MAE预训练的早期阶段，发现其学习模式分组的特性，并提出了一种自引导遮掩编码器方法，用内部生成的知情掩码替代随机掩码。

Result: 提出的方法在多种下游任务上显著提高了MAE的学习效率和效果。

Conclusion: 基于内部生成的知情掩码能有效增强MAE的学习能力，同时保持其自监督学习的特性。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Kanglin Qu,Pan Gao,Qun Dai,Yuanhao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型的新型点云学习网络HydraMamba，旨在解决点云串行化效果差和缺乏局部学习能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制在点云学习中由于复杂度高，难以处理长距离依赖，而已有的状态空间模型（例如S6）在全局依赖捕获中表现良好，却缺乏局部学习能力和点云串行化的优化。

Method: 提出了HydraMamba模型，包括：1. 一种基于洗牌的点云串行化策略；2. 新型ConvBiS6层用于同时捕获局部几何和全局上下文依赖；3. 多头设计（MHS6）的扩展以增强建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在目标级和场景级的多项任务上达到了目前最新的最优性能。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和引入本地性学习，显著改善了点云学习中的长距离依赖建模能力与整体性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出JDATT框架，通过联合知识蒸馏实现大气湍流减轻与目标检测，并显著减少模型大小和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大气湍流减轻与目标检测方法复杂高耗，且分离处理降低性能，缺乏适合资源受限实时应用的解决方案。

Method: 提出JDATT框架，将最先进湍流减轻与检测模块整合，同时运用通道式与掩码生成知识蒸馏以及输出级KL散度蒸馏的混合策略优化模型。

Result: JDATT在合成和真实湍流数据上实现了更优视觉恢复与检测精度，同时显著减少了模型大小与推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT适用于资源受限场景中的实时部署，兼具效率与性能。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

*Suhwan Cho,Minhyeok Lee,Jungho Lee,Sunghun Yang,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFlow是一种从视频扩散模型中转移运动知识来生成真实培训数据的视频显著目标检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限于现有的视频数据集稀少性，以及现有生成方法在运动指导任务上的局限性。

Method: 利用预训练视频扩散模型的运动先验知识，从静态图像生成具备语义感知的光流，实现自然运动模式及时空一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，证明了运动知识传递的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过将视频扩散模型的运动知识用于生成训练数据，提升了视频显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DepthFlow的新方法，通过从单幅图像生成光流以扩展无监督视频目标分割(VOS)模型的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督视频目标分割训练数据稀缺的问题，尤其是对光流的依赖。

Method: 通过先估计图像深度图，然后将深度图转换为保留结构信息的合成流场，利用此生成的图像-流-掩膜对进行模型训练。

Result: 训练一个简单的编码器-解码器架构并在所有公共VOS基准上实现了新的性能最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的DepthFlow方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，并证明了其在无监督视频目标分割任务中的可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Conclusion: 本文通过设计改进证明了神经网络的架构优化能够实现性能提升与资源需求降低，这在计算机视觉领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Conclusion: ForCenNet通过关注前景元素的几何信息，有效提升了文档图像校正的精度，并为后续研究提供了资源链接。

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DS-Det的新型检测器，通过单一查询范式和优化的解码器设计，解决了现有检测器中固定查询和查询歧义的问题，并显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的检测器使用固定查询的方式限制了其灵活性，并且受到查询间的相互干扰(recurrent opposing interactions)的影响，同时在训练中也存在查询歧义的问题。

Method: 提出了一种单一查询(Single-Query)范式，将固定查询转变为灵活查询，并设计了一个简化解码器，通过解耦的注意力机制解决ROT和查询歧义问题。此外引入了一个统一的PoCoo损失函数以增强对硬样本(如小目标)的学习能力。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上使用五种不同骨干模型进行了广泛实验，验证了DS-Det的通用性和优越性能。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过改进解码器的查询机制和优化训练过程，不仅提升了检测性能，还提高了解码效率，为目标检测任务提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为SeeDiff的方法，通过利用Stable Diffusion中的关注机制，无需额外训练过程或预训练的分割网络即可生成高质量的像素级注释掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成像素级注释掩码时，依赖额外的训练、精心设计的文本提示或预训练的分割网络，效率低下。

Method: 通过对Stable Diffusion中的交叉注意力和自注意力机制进行深入研究，设计了一种模仿种子分割的方法，从初始种子利用自注意力扩展至整个类，并利用简单背景的合成图像进一步优化背景掩码。

Result: 证明了SeeDiff能够直接从Stable Diffusion生成高质量注释掩码，无需额外训练或调优。

Conclusion: SeeDiff方法有效、简洁，为语义分割提供了一种实用的生成方法。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FM-LC的分层框架，用于解决干旱地区的城市洪灾精准绘图难题，展示了显著优于传统单阶段U-Net的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于干旱地区水域与周围地表光谱对比弱且城市地表复杂，传统洪水绘图方法表现不佳，亟需提高应急响应能力及规划韧性的新方法。

Method: 设计FM-LC分层框架，分三阶段进行：初步分类、多类混淆问题分类调优、贝叶斯平滑优化；基于高分辨率PlanetScope影像验证方法效果。

Result: 实验表明，FM-LC在多地表分类的F1评分上提高了29%，洪水边界绘制更加清晰，远超传统单阶段模型。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架在干旱城市地区洪水精准绘制领域展示出高度潜力，具备应用于紧急响应及恢复计划的能力。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

Motivation: 现代城市环境产生大量视频数据，需要可扩展的视频分析方法，而现有基于SQL的视频查询方式过于刚性，限制了分析的灵活性。

Conclusion: LAVA系统实现了灵活自然语言驱动的视频分析，显著提高了处理精度与速度，展示了其在大规模视频数据分析中的潜力。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

Method: 提出一种基于解码器的转换器模型AutoSign，结合时间压缩模块（1D CNN）处理姿态序列，并利用预训练的阿拉伯语解码器AraGPT2生成文本（手语词汇）。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，AutoSign与现有最佳方法相比，WER指标提升了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign成功消除了多阶段管线，实现更高效的手语识别，为用户提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

*Wenjie Zhu,Yabin Zhang,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出KR-NFT，改进了视觉语言模型的OOD检测性能，同时保持了对未见类别和风格的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的负提示调优方法虽然提升了OOD检测能力，但往往降低了对未见类别和风格的泛化性能。

Method: 引入了负特征调优（NFT）架构和知识正则化（KR）优化策略。NFT通过对文本特征进行分布感知转换，分离正负特征空间；KR优化策略则旨在增强ID和OOD数据集的判别性，同时减少预训练知识的遗忘。

Result: KR-NFT在ImageNet数据集的少样本训练下，不仅提升了ID分类准确性和OOD检测性能，还减少了FPR95达5.44%。

Conclusion: KR-NFT通过分离特征和知识正则化显著改进了OOD检测性能，适用于未见类别和风格的泛化场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

TL;DR: 提出FineMotion数据集，支持通过文本描述生成细粒度的人体动作，显著提升生成准确性，并支持零样本细粒度动作编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通过文本生成人体动作方法普遍忽略了特定身体部位的细节与时间一致性，需改进文本描述的细粒度表达。

Method: 构建FineMotion数据集，包含442,000个人体动作片段及详细描述，及95,000段对应完整动作序列的细粒度文本描述。

Result: 实验表明，该数据集在细粒度的人体动作生成任务中性能显著提升，MDM模型Top-3准确率提高了15.3%。

Conclusion: FineMotion数据集为文本驱动人体动作生成和编辑提供了新的方向，尤其在细粒度控制层面产生突破，数据集和代码已经开源。

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

### [31] [A Structure-aware and Motion-adaptive Framework for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19852)
*Ye Lu,Jie Wang,Jianjun Gao,Rui Gong,Chen Cai,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为SAMA的框架，用于解决姿势提升任务中的关节依赖性建模问题，能以较低计算成本达到更高级别的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的基于Mamba的方法在姿势提升任务中虽然有效，但对关节动态的建模有限，特别是无法准确处理复杂的关节关系和不同运动特性之间的差异性。

Method: 提出了一个名为SAMA的框架，其中包括结构感知的状态集成器（SSI）和运动自适应的状态调整器（MSM），分别负责动态关节关系整合和不同关节的运动特性识别与调整。

Result: 在多个基准上进行的广泛实验表明，该算法在较低计算成本下取得了先进的结果。

Conclusion: SAMA框架通过结构感知和运动自适应的方式，有效应对了复杂关节关系和运动特性差异，提升了姿势提升任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

TL;DR: 本文提出RaGS框架，通过3D高斯点融合4D毫米波雷达与单目图像，从而用于3D物体检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的融合方法要么缺乏整体场景理解，要么受限于固定的网格结构，本研究旨在解决这些限制。

Method: RaGS框架利用3D高斯点表示，逐步构建和优化高斯场。具体包括Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI)初始化3D高斯位置，Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)跨模态优化稀疏区域，以及Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF)将高斯渲染成多层BEV特征以进行检测。

Result: 实验表明，RaGS在View-of-Delft、TJ4DRadSet和OmniHD-Scenes等基准上达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过动态集中稀疏目标，RaGS满足目标区集中和全面场景感知的双重需求，是3D物体检测的新颖高效解决方案。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的视觉分析系统OW-CLIP，用以解决开放世界目标检测中的数据需求和过度拟合问题，采用多模态提示调优和裁剪平滑技术，在数据量极少的情况下达到SOTA的89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测需要识别已知和未知物体，并需随新增标注数据进行模型的连续适应，现有方法依赖大量标注数据且模型架构限制较多。

Method: 引入OW-CLIP系统，通过多模态提示调优和裁剪平滑方法缓解过拟合问题，并利用大语言模型与跨模态相似性进行数据生成与筛选，同时提供可视化接口提升标注质量。

Result: OW-CLIP在仅使用3.8%自生成数据的情况下，性能达到当前SOTA的89%，且在相同训练数据量下超越SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 新的方法显著减少了数据需求，优化了标注质量，并增强了开放世界目标检测的效率和精度。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为DiffCode的框架，利用潜在扩散增强的矢量量化词典先验，解决多个医学图像恢复任务中的异质性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效处理不同任务之间的异质性造成的信息丢失问题，因此需要统一的模型来更好地解决此问题。

Method: 提出了一个任务自适应词典库和潜在扩散策略，结合扩散模型的强大能力，改善低质量医学图像的恢复性能。

Result: 在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成三项任务中，DiffCode在量化指标和视觉质量上均表现优越。

Conclusion: DiffCode框架有效解决了信息丢失问题，为多任务医学图像恢复提供了一个统一的高性能解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

TL;DR: ATCTrack是一种新型的视觉-语言跟踪方法，利用多模态特征建模解决了目标状态动态变化及文本提示处理的难题，达到了新的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言跟踪器无法动态处理目标状态及有效利用目标和上下文提示词，尤其在复杂的长时间序列中表现乏力。

Method: 提出ATCTrack，通过视觉和文本两种模式建模动态目标-上下文特征。具体包括时间视觉特征建模方法和文本目标词识别及上下文词校准方法。

Result: 在主流基准上获得了新的SOTA性能，展示了跟踪效率和鲁棒性的提升。

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过目标-上下文特征建模显著提升了视觉-语言跟踪性能，验证了方法的有效性且相关代码和模型已开放。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Conclusion: 新方法在室内的GPS缺失环境下验证成功，适用于实时嵌入式部署，在性能与资源效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

Result: 实验在五个实际数据集（Cityscapes, BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, ACDC）上验证，全局模型优于单客户端模型，并接近拥有集中数据训练的模型，性能仅落后2个mIoU。

Conclusion: FedS2R 在联邦学习环境下实现了语义分割任务的有效性，尤其适用于自主驾驶领域的合成到真实场景应用。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

TL;DR: 提出一种名为反向对比注意（RCA）的插件方法，用于强化视觉语言Transformer中的目标定位，而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过解决当前视觉语言模型中注意力极端值的偏差问题，以提升模型对语义相关特征的感知能力，从而改进开放词汇指示目标检测的性能。

Method: 利用反向对比注意的方法，重新加权Transformer最后一层的注意力，通过压制极端值和增强中等级激活，从而使语义相关但被压制的Token更好地指导预测。

Result: 在开放词汇指示目标检测任务（OV-RefOD）中，引入了FitAP指标，评估RCA在15个开源视觉语言模型中的表现，11个模型获性能提升，最大增益达到+26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA不仅提供了对多模态Transformer的解释性，还提高了其性能，尤其在注意力集中度高和后融合模型中表现尤为明显。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法需要针对每一类别单独训练模型，泛化能力有限，且在实际场景中不可行，因此需要设计能够推广到多个类别的统一模型。

Method: 提出了TrackAny3D框架，引入参数高效的适配器以弥合预训练和跟踪任务的差距；设计了几何专家混合架构（MoGE）根据几何特征自适应激活子网络；结合时间上下文优化策略以传播历史信息并减轻时间漂移。

Conclusion: TrackAny3D框架为类别无关3D单目标跟踪领域提供了新的思路，同时展示了大规模预训练模型在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Motivation: 为了解决传统卷积网络受限于局部感受野及视觉Transformer高计算成本的问题。

Method: 设计了一个混合的Hi-Encoder和BF-Decoder，其中Hi-Encoder使用Mamba结合卷积进行低层语义特征提取和长期依赖建模，BF-Decoder通过跳跃连接融合局部与全局信息生成分割掩码。

Conclusion: 该方法能以低计算成本有效处理医学图像分割并具有广泛的实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，与其他最新方法相比，LLM_Control在多种预训练模型上的图像合成质量具有竞争力。

Conclusion: LLM_Control能处理大多数现有方法难以应对的复杂输入条件，提升文本生成图像的控制精度和质量。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Conclusion: 结合CNN和Transformer的UniCT Depth方法显著改进了事件-图像深度估计性能，同时对边缘与纹理细节有更好的处理能力。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP方法有效提升了异常检测的精确性和实用性，同时实现了零样本学习到少样本学习的扩展。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our

state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Conclusion: FROSS能够以更实时和高效的方式生成3D语义场景图，为高层次场景理解提供了新可能。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Conclusion: 提供了一种新型多用途的CVD风险评估范式，提高了预测的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient
and efficient deployment strategies.

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和多模态大语言模型视觉感知任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: RICE方法在区域级视觉与OCR能力上显著提升，是相关任务的有力工具。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been
released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型的图像标题生成通常过于简短和泛化，尽管模型具有强大的视觉和语言能力。

Method: 通过一种无监督方法，减少模型在训练中对结束标记（EOS）过早预测的偏差，提升标题长度和细节，无需复杂奖赏函数或监督。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督方法简单易行，能够显著提高图像标题生成的细节丰富性和长度，但虚假内容问题需要关注。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了KB-DMGen方法在提升人像生成模型中的姿态准确性和整体图像质量的效果，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在应对多目标和风格指定的复杂提示时，缺乏风格统一性和空间一致性问题。

Conclusion: LPA方法为扩散模型在可控性与表现力方面提供了一个新方向，同时无需耗时的模型训练。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法在检测内上髁撕脱中优于已有方法，提供了一种有效的异常检测手段，同时公开了相关数据集供研究使用。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM 实现了在3D场景理解中的重大进步，解决了点云处理中的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对在线视频分割存在时序一致性差、噪声积累、遮挡和场景切换等问题，提出一种新的解决方案。

Method: 利用DETR框架引入局部查询和全局查询，并设计轻量级的transformer解码器L2G-aligner，增强局部和全局特征的对齐，无需复杂的启发式或记忆机制。

Result: 在多个VIS和VPS数据集上实现了当前最优性能，例如在Youtube-VIS-19/-21数据集上分别取得54.3和49.4的AP，在OVIS数据集上取得37.0的AP。

Conclusion: 通过简单的在线训练，Local2Global框架实现了无复杂策略的高性能视频分割，具备优异的时间一致性和学习效率。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC模型在智能农业领域有潜在应用价值，为农业生产及相关学术和工业研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

real-time instance segmentation (Box mAP@0.5 ~ 0.769, Mask mAP@0.5 ~ 0.800 at ~

which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated
blast-effect assessment in field conditions.

Conclusion: WMNet在解决跨模态对齐问题中具有显著效果，并在实际应用中具有较强的实用性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Result: 实验表明，使用GT-mean loss能在多种方法和数据集上提升性能。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss有效解决了亮度不匹配问题，为低光图像增强提供了一种改进方法。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Motivation: 当前将视觉数据引入VLMs会带来数据质量的挑战，优质训练数据对模型效果影响显著，因此需要一种高效、精准的数据过滤方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于紧凑VLM的数据过滤框架，通过微调在高质量图像-文本数据集上的小型VLM，评估并过滤潜在训练样本的图像质量、文本质量及其对齐度，无需额外的过滤模块，从而降低训练成本。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种轻量化但有效的解决方案，用于构建高质量的视觉语言训练数据集，并显著优化图像与文本的对齐和描述流畅性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,
training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely

Method: 提出了LLM-IAVC模型，包括：1）身份相关信息提取模块（IRIEM），结合视觉特征、球员名字与双向语义交互；2）视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），捕捉视频上下文信息；3）利用上述模块输出的多模态提示输入到大语言模型生成带有球员身份的描述。同时构建了用于验证的数据集NBA-Identity。

Conclusion: 通过提出多模态网络大幅提升了体育视频描述的准确性和实用性，并公开了相关代码和数据集供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Zeyu1226-mt/LLM-IAVC.

*Clinton Ansun Mo,Kun Hu,Chengjiang Long,Dong Yuan,Wan-Chi Siu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了用于TPC格式数据的运动合成模型PUMPS，其在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动数据难以在不同骨架间转移，基于TPC的兼容性进行直接运动学习面临挑战，急需相关数据合成方法支持。

Method: 提出PUMPS模型，通过基于线性分配的点对优化重建TPC，并使用潜在高斯噪声向量作为采样标识符。无需使用昂贵的点注意力机制，实现了3D运动合成任务预训练。

Result: PUMPS在无监督数据集上表现出与当前最佳方法相当的性能，在运动降噪及估计任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PUMPS具有通用性，可广泛应用于运动预测、过渡生成、关键帧插值等领域，并为基于TPC的运动合成提供了一种高效方案。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)在空间理解上的新方法和基准，并发现现有VLMs在空间理解能力方面仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动视觉语言模型在绝对空间理解和三维空间理解（包括移动和旋转）方面的研究，以满足真实世界对精确空间感知的需求，比如自动驾驶和仿人机器人操作。

Method: 设计了一个全新的空间评估流程，并构建了一个完全合成的数据集，该数据集可以低成本生成测试样本，避免数据集污染，并采用该数据集对多种先进的VLMs进行了实验评估。

Result: 实验表明，现有的VLMs在绝大多数任务中的表现显著低于人类水平，尤其在复杂任务中的表现接近于零。而人类在所有任务上几乎达到了完美表现。

Conclusion: 当前的视觉语言模型在空间理解上还有巨大改进空间。本研究为未来的模型评估和改进提供了重要的基准和参考工具。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有许多红外与可见光图像融合方法未充分考虑光照变化因素，导致融合结果中存在模态偏差。

Method: 提出了MoCTEFuse网络，使用基于光照引导的异向变压器专家模块动态调整模态信息，通过多阶段堆叠逐步聚合和优化特定模态及跨模态信息，并结合三层次的竞争损失函数实现鲁棒训练。

Result: MoCTEFuse在DroneVehicle、MSRS、TNO和RoadScene数据集上表现优异，分别在MFNet和DroneVehicle数据集上达到70.93%和45.14%的mAP。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse显著提升了异构模态图像融合质量，发布的代码和模型将为相关领域研究提供支持。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model

Motivation: 探索如何提升大模型SAM在复杂任务中的表现，弥补传统微调方法在特征提取上的局限性。

Method: 提出使用小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并设计复杂值适配器以增强SAM对空间-频率信息的捕获能力。

Conclusion: SAMwave展现了卓越的性能、灵活性和解释性，为大模型在细粒度任务上的应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model

We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了MIRepNet，这是第一个针对运动想象(MI)范式定制的EEG基础模型，展现了在多个数据集上的卓越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG基础模型未能充分考虑不同脑机接口(BCI)范式的神经生理学差异，降低了其泛化能力，尤其是在实际应用中需要针对特定范式设计如运动想象(MI)的情况。

Method: 提出MIRepNet，包含一个高质量EEG预处理管道（基于神经生理学的通道模板）以及一种混合预训练策略（结合自监督的掩码重构与有监督的MI分类）。

Result: MIRepNet在五个公开MI数据集上的评估中，一致取得了最先进的性能，且显著优于现有的专用与通用EEG模型。

Conclusion: MIRepNet展现了其在运动想象范式中的优越性，为快速适应与精准解码新任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on
GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/staraink/MIRepNet}.

TL;DR: 提出轻量化多模态对比注意力变压器 (L-MCAT)，用于高效的遥感图像分类，具备高准确性和低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能有效处理非配对遥感数据且对标签需求低的模型，同时提升计算效率。

Method: 引入模态-光谱适配器（MSA）和非配对多模态注意力对齐（U-MAA），在统一嵌入空间压缩输入及对齐异构模态。

Result: 在SEN12MS数据集上仅需每类20个标签就能达到95.4%的准确率，并在参数量和计算量上显著降低，同时对空间错位具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: L-MCAT在保证高精度的同时具备轻量化、高效性与鲁棒性，适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%
spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

*Yooshin Cho,Hanbyel Cho,Janghyeon Lee,HyeongGwon Hong,Jaesung Ahn,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用可控特征白化框架，以解决深度神经网络学习数据集偏差问题，并验证其在多个数据集上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在使用中容易学习到数据集中的虚假关联，影响人工智能的可靠性，因此需要一种新方法来减少特征间的偏差并提高模型的公正性。

Method: 通过协方差矩阵衡量目标特征和偏差特征之间的线性关联，并利用白化模块消除这种关联，从而减少偏差。此外，可通过调整权重系数来控制算法的实用性与公平性之间的权衡，而无需使用正则化项或对抗学习。

Result: 该方法有效减轻了偏差，在不建模高阶依赖的情况下显著提高模型可靠性，并在四个基准数据集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过消除最后线性分类器输入特征间的线性关联，该方法显著提高了模型的公平性和可靠性，且具有简单、高效和稳定优化的特点。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对紧急新闻的假新闻视频检测效果较差，且存在事件间分布转移导致的一般化问题。

Method: 采用测试时间训练（TTT）框架，设计基于语言掩码模型（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，通过多模态上下文信息来预测被掩码的单词。

Result: 公开基准上进行了大量实验，证明了该方法在尤为紧急新闻的检测中具有高效性。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性，特别是在紧急新闻场景下表现良好。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Transfer VAE Training (TVT)的策略，用以提升基于稳定扩散模型的图像超分辨率能力，特别是在细节结构上的恢复效果，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对稳定扩散模型中变分自编码器（VAE）采用激进的8倍下采样导致细节结构（如小字符和纹理）恢复效果较差的问题，该研究希望找到解决方案。

Method: 提出了TVT策略，将原先8倍下采样的VAE转移为4倍下采样，同时适配预训练的UNet。具体实现包括先训练一个4倍的解码器，然后固定该解码器训练4倍的编码器。此外，优化VAE和UNet的架构以降低计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在提升细节结构还原能力方面优于其它基于稳定扩散的模型，同时计算成本显著低于最先进的单步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT策略不仅改善了图像超分辨率模型的细节恢复能力，还通过架构优化实现了计算效率的提升，为实际应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

### [90] [SWIFT: A General Sensitive Weight Identification Framework for Fast Sensor-Transfer Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20311)
*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SWIFT框架，用于快速跨传感器自适应，旨在解决深度学习方法在跨传感器时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在处理未见传感器数据时表现不佳，而完全重新训练或设计复杂架构在实际应用中成本过高且不可行。

Method: SWIFT框架利用无监督采样策略选择目标域中最具信息量的3%样本，通过分析模型参数的梯度行为快速定位和更新对域偏移最敏感的权重子集，实现快速跨传感器自适应。

Result: SWIFT方法大幅缩短了适配时间（从小时缩短至约一分钟），在多个实验中表现优异，不仅优于直接迁移并且在某些场景下超越了重新训练的效果。

Conclusion: SWIFT框架作为一种即插即用的方法，为跨传感器的全色锐化任务提供了高效且通用的解决方案，并在多个数据集上树立了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法，用于在动态视频场景中插入3D物体，以实现写实的光照效果和时域一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在时域一致性和真实光照效果之间难以兼顾，且动态场景的复杂性增加了难度，因此需要一种新的方法应对这些挑战。

Method: 使用3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）进行初始渲染以保证时域一致性，并通过2D扩散模型进行光照优化，同时引入分离固有属性的着色管线和多帧加权调整优化。

Result: 证明了结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法可以在动态手腕场景中成功插入手镯，实现了高质量、时域一致的真实效果。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功将3D渲染与2D扩散模型相结合，为实现真实且一致的视频编辑提供了创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Motivation: 增强现实引导的腹腔镜肝脏手术需要将术前信息准确地融合到术中视图中，但肝脏变形预测困难重重，如大范围变形、噪声数据、视野受限等。

Method: 提出PIVOTS，一种基于点云输入的神经网络，利用几何特征提取编码器和新颖的变形关注交叉模块实现信息交互及多级位移预测，并通过生物力学模拟管线生成合成数据进行训练。

Result: 验证表明PIVOTS在合成和真实数据集上的注册性能优于基线方法，对高噪声、大变形和不同术中可见性具有较强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究显著推动了肝脏注册方法的发展，并提供相关代码和数据集以促进公平对比研究。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code
and datasets are available here https://github.com/pengliu-nct/PIVOTS.

Conclusion: 通过分类和数据集构建以及多模态检测框架的设计，本研究成功实现了增强现实中视觉信息操控攻击的识别，为该领域提供了新方法和工具。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前面部美感预测对高层次的美学评价特征难以有效捕捉，需要开发针对性的特征提取方法。

Method: 首先对Diffusion Transformer利用无标签数据集进行自监督预训练，然后固定编码器为特征提取器，并通过轻量化回归头在目标数据集上微调。

Result: 在FBP5500标杆数据集上取得最佳表现，PCC达到0.932，大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成模型的预训练策略对提升特征表达作用显著，适用于主观视觉任务中的高效推断。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Method: 创建MagicAnime数据集，该数据集包括不同类型的卡通动画视频及关键点对等多模态数据，支持多种任务，并提出MagicAnime-Bench基准提供方法比较。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集及其基准可以有效支持多模态卡通动画生成任务的研究，对领域发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了通过整合多模态信息，能够显著提升低光照图像增强性能，提供了一个新的方向和思路。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Motivation: 尽管先前研究表明面部特征可以改善手语识别，但相关工作大多依赖于手工特征提取，且未深入探索不同面部区域的具体贡献。

Method: 采用两种深度学习模型（基于CNN的模型和基于Transformer的模型）对手语数据集进行训练，并评估不同面部区域对识别性能的贡献。

Result: 通过量化性能和显著性图评价，发现嘴巴区域对手语识别准确率提升最为显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调在ASLR中整合面部特征的必要性，尤其是嘴巴特征的关键作用。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

*Zhecheng Li,Guoxian Song,Yiwei Wang,Zhen Xiong,Junsong Yuan,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将图像中的数学表达式或表格数据转换为LaTeX代码，并提出了一个名为$A^2R^2$的框架，通过视觉推理和注意力引导的改进来实现更高的精确度和自我校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像转LaTeX任务上的表现不尽如人意，特别是在处理细粒度视觉元素时容易出错，因此需要一个更有效的方法。

Method: 提出了$A^2R^2$框架，该框架将注意力定位与迭代改进融入到视觉推理框架中，并设计了一个新数据集Img2LaTex-Hard-1K，用于严格评估VLM在这一领域的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明：1）$A^2R^2$在六项评估指标上显著优于基线方法；2）增加推理次数会提高性能；3）消融实验和人为评估验证了该方法的实际有效性及其核心模块间的强协作性。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$通过解决VLM在细粒度视觉元素上的不足，显著改进了图像到LaTeX转换的性能，并展现出在推理扩展场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

TL;DR: VESPA是一种结合LiDAR几何精度和相机图像语义丰富性的多模态自动标注流程，用于生成高质量3D伪标签，无需地面真实标注或高清地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注特别是3D标注的高成本和劳动强度严重限制了自动驾驶数据的扩展能力，现有基于LiDAR的自动标注方法存在数据稀疏、遮挡和目标观察不完整等问题，同时缺乏语义细化能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何与语义信息，以及利用视觉语言模型，VESPA实现了对3D点云的高效、高质量自动标注，解决了自动驾驶数据标注的关键难题。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法中3D面部模型重建与说话人脸合成脱节的问题，提出联合学习模型以优化表情表示并提升嘴唇同步效果。

Method: 通过联合学习3D面部重建模型和说话人脸合成模型，引入基于FACS的blendshape表情表示，同时设计了新的嘴唇同步流水线，解耦下巴轮廓以减少闪烁。

Result: 所提出方法提高了生成面部的质量，优化了基于音频的嘴唇同步效果，显著减少了口部闪烁问题。

Conclusion: 联合学习的策略表明，优化用于说话人脸合成的3D表情表示可以显著提升生成效果，并在嘴唇同步方面展现了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SparseVAR，这是一个加速视觉自回归建模的新框架，通过在推断过程中动态排除低频token实现高效计算，同时保持图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决下一尺度预测中高分辨率阶段计算开销高的问题，提出方法在不需要额外训练的情况下，通过动态排除低频token来加速计算。

Method: 通过观察低频区域token对图像质量影响小且与邻域token相似性强，以及模型不同部分关注点的不同，引入MSE-based指标识别低频token，同时保留部分anchor token以保证质量。

Result: 在HART和Infinity框架中显著减少计算成本的同时，SparseVAR实现了生成图像高质量和加速性能，在Infinity-2B模型中达到了最高2倍加速，并且质量降级少。

Conclusion: 通过动态排除低频token及保留必要的锚点，SparseVAR在保持图像质量的同时大幅度提高了生成速度，展现了高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过纵向层级和横向层级优先级设定解决了现有多实例学习（MIL）在病理诊断中缺乏优先级的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL模型无法区分病理症状与诊断类别之间的优先级，可能忽略重要类别，影响临床应用效果。

Method: 设计了纵向层级间（inter-hierarchy）和横向层级内（intra-hierarchy）的优先级机制，同时引入特征重用，以便在训练过程中优先处理临床上更重要的类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效减少误诊，并在多类别场景中优先考虑更重要的症状。进一步的分析验证了各组件的有效性，并通过案例确认了其预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入层级优先机制，提升了MIL模型在临床病理诊断中的应用效果，尤其在复杂多症状情境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv8s-p2模型兼具高准确性和速度，为杂交水稻种生产中的自动化监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

*Haiyang Bai,Jiaqi Zhu,Songru Jiang,Wei Huang,Tao Lu,Yuanqi Li,Jie Guo,Runze Fu,Yanwen Guo,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种基于3D高斯点分布的户外重光框架，使用内在图像分解更精确地结合了阳光、天空辐射和间接照明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将每个图像的全局照明压缩为单一隐向量，限制了阴影和光照效果的多样性和动态性。

Method: 提出了三大技术创新：(1) 基于残差的太阳可见性提取方法，用于准确分离阳光效果；(2) 基于区域的监督框架和结构一致性损失进行物理可解释的光照分解；(3) 基于光线追踪的技术模拟真实阴影。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在新视图合成的保真度方面可与最先进的重光解决方案竞争，并能够生成更自然、多样化的光照和阴影效果。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了重光技术效果，还在物理可解释性和动态阴影生成方面展现了显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

### [112] [T2VParser: Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for Partial Alignment in Text to Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20518)
*Yili Li,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Xiangyan Qu,Jiamin Zhuang,Zhen Li,Junzheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VParser 提出一种方法，通过提取多视角的语义表示，实现文本和视频的自适应语义对齐，避免直接对齐所带来的错误监督问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本和视频在多模态匹配中常出现信息不对等的现象，现有方法直接对两者对齐可能产生部分错误监督，因此需要一种能自适应捕捉多种语义对齐的系统。

Method: 通过引入自适应分解标记（Adaptive Decomposition Tokens），实现跨模态的内容分解与对齐，同时保留预训练模型的知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，T2VParser 能有效实现文本与视频的部分精确对齐，提高检索性能。

Conclusion: T2VParser 提供了一种新颖的方法来解决视频与文本的不对等信息对齐问题，为这一多模态领域的研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at
https://github.com/Lilidamowang/T2VParser.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AgroBench, 一个专为农业领域设计的视觉语言模型(VLMs)评估基准，覆盖了广泛的农业主题并由专家农学家标注。研究发现现有的VLM在细粒度任务中表现仍有提升空间，特别是在杂草识别中接近随机表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现有视觉语言模型在农业任务中的潜力，推动其在病害识别等可持续作物生产关键领域的应用。

Method: 开发了AgroBench，涵盖7个主要农业主题及其详细分类，包括203种作物和682种病害，以全面评估视觉语言模型的能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有视觉语言模型在细粒度识别任务中表现一般，特别是杂草识别的表现几乎与随机结果无异。提出了未来可能改进的方向。

Conclusion: AgroBench为农业视觉语言模型提供了专家级评估基准，数据集和代码公开，为模型改进和应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

*Xun Liang,Xin Guo,Zhongming Jin,Weihang Pan,Penghui Shang,Deng Cai,Binbin Lin,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpatialVTS的方法，通过视觉与文本的双重思维增强空间推理能力，显著提高模型在多个空间理解任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间推理是视觉问答（VQA）和机器人领域的关键能力，但现有视觉语言模型在此任务上表现较弱，因此需要开发更强的空间推理方法。

Method: 提出SpatialVTS方法，包括两个阶段：在视觉思维阶段，通过训练生成与目标相关的位置特定标记；在文本思维阶段，基于视觉提示和对话进行长期推理。此外，通过手动修正现有数据集，优化标签，提高广义能力，并增强逻辑推理能力。

Result: 无需额外信息（如掩模或深度），模型在多个空间理解任务上的平均表现优于其他模型。

Conclusion: SpatialVTS方法能够显著提升空间推理能力，展示了其在空间理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文设计、开发并评估了一种基于计算机视觉和气动剔除的绿色扁豆动态分类系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有谷物分类系统的准确性和实时性不足，研究提出一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv8检测和分类技术，结合气动剔除机制和Arduino控制系统实现分拣，支持六类分类。

Result: 系统在59 mm/s的输送带速度下，分类准确性达到87.2%，但加工速率受限为8克/分钟。

Conclusion: 该原型展示了机器视觉在谷物分拣中的潜力，为未来改进提供可扩展基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

### [116] [T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536)
*Chieh-Yun Chen,Min Shi,Gong Zhang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个创新的无训练多代理系统T2I-Copilot，用于自动生成和优化文本到图像的生成提示，显著提升了生成质量和文本-图像对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感，用户需要多次反复优化提示词，没有明确反馈且控制性较差，因此需要一种简化提示工程并提高生成效果的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一个由三个代理组成的系统：（1）输入解释器解析输入提示并生成标准化报告；（2）生成引擎根据提示和模型组织生成多模态内容；（3）质量评估器评估生成质量以及文本-图像对齐性，提供反馈并辅助再生成。

Result: 使用开源模型在GenAI-Bench上达到媲美商业模型的VQA得分，超越了多个竞品模型的性能，并且成本更低。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot证明了多代理协作在高效生成文本到图像内容中的有效性，提供了显著增强的质量和对齐能力，同时具备经济可行性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

*Lan Yang,Kaiyue Pang,Honggang Zhang,Yi-Zhe Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了草图质量评估问题，提出了一种泛化的几何感知分类层（GACL）方法，通过特征大小作为质量度量标准，而无需特定人工质量标注。实验验证其与人类感知一致性，并拓展至图像质量评估和数据再加权领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草图在表示视觉信息时因质量参差不齐会对实际应用带来障碍，因此需要一种有效的草图质量评估方法。

Method: 提出了几何感知分类层（GACL），将特征量级与识别学习视为双重任务，以交叉熵分类损失联合优化，且无需人工标注质量数据。

Result: 通过16万次大规模人类试验验证了GACL度量与人类质量感知的一致性，并展示了三种草图应用场景。同时将其成功扩展到图像质量评估和噪声标注清理等问题。

Conclusion: GACL方法实现了泛化的质量度量与数据再加权能力，适用于草图、自然图像等多种抽象视觉表示和垂直领域问题。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

*Jingting Li,Yu Qian,Lin Zhao,Su-Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FED-PsyAU框架，通过整合心理先验和AU统计模式提升微表情识别性能，同时保护数据隐私并解决样本量少的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者希望克服微表情识别中的样本稀缺性、特征微弱性及数据隐私问题，提升真实场景下的识别性能。

Method: 提出FED-PsyAU框架，包括基于心理学的AU协调性研究和DPK-GAT网络模型，结合联邦学习以在多个客户端无数据共享下实现模型优化。

Result: 实验表明，方法在常用微表情数据库上表现出显著提升的识别效果。

Conclusion: 本文方法不仅提升了微表情识别性能，还在联邦学习框架下保护了隐私，解决了实际应用中的关键难题。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MemoryTalker模型，通过音频输入生成个性化3D面部动画，无需额外先验信息，并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外的先验信息，如说话人的类别标签或额外的3D面部网格，无法完全反映说话风格，限制了其实用性。

Method: MemoryTalker分为两阶段：第一阶段存储和检索通用动作（即记忆阶段），第二阶段根据音频驱动的说话风格特征个性化生成面部动作（即动画阶段）。

Result: MemoryTalker无需额外先验信息即可生成高质量的、个性化的3D面部动画，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker通过有效利用音频驱动，实现了真实而个性化的3D面部动作合成，显著提升了实用性和表现。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于音素上下文感知的新型损失函数用于改进语音驱动的3D面部动画，解决了传统方法的抖动和不自然问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中因逐帧优化导致的面部动作不连续和输出不自然的问题。

Method: 通过设计音素上下文感知损失函数，结合音素共发音权重调整面部动作在动态变化中的重要性，确保较平滑的动画效果。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在量化指标和视觉质量上均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 强调建模音素上下文相关的视觉语素对生成自然的语音驱动3D面部动画的重要性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统船舶检测在复杂场景中表现有限，亟需结合多模态图像提升鲁棒性和检测性能。

Result: 验证了LSFDNet在两个数据集上的优越性能，显著提升了船舶检测准确性。

Conclusion: LSFDNet通过融合多模态特性和改进损失函数，对复杂场景下的船舶检测具有显著提升作用。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型对MRI切片间的空间相关性利用不足，而这些信息对提升分割连续性和准确性至关重要。

Method: 提出M-Net框架，引入Mesh-Cast机制整合顺序模型同时处理通道和时序信息，并设计两阶段训练策略，分别学习序列间通用特征与切片特异性特征。

Result: M-Net在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上的关键性能指标优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net是一种鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了MRI肿瘤分割的效率和准确性，克服了全3D卷积的计算成本问题。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法HYPIR，通过预训练扩散模型初始化图像恢复模型并进行对抗训练，克服了现有方法在恢复质量、可信度和速度之间的权衡问题，表现优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像恢复方法难以在去除退化、生成真实细节和像素级一致性之间达到最佳平衡，且不同方法在恢复质量、忠实度和速度上各有不足。

Method: 提出了一种名为HYPIR的方法，通过预训练的扩散模型初始化图像恢复模型，然后进行对抗训练，无需额外损失函数、迭代采样或适配器。在理论上证明了这种初始化方式提升了数值稳定性，避免了模式崩溃并加速了对抗训练的收敛。

Result: HYPIR继承了扩散模型的丰富控制能力，可实现文本引导恢复和纹理丰富度调节。实验表明，其在收敛速度和推理速度上优于扩散方法，并且恢复效果和效率超过SOTA（最新最优）方法。

Conclusion: HYPIR方法提供了一种快速、高效且质量优异的图像恢复新途径，具备多样控制和纹理调节能力，为图像恢复领域做出了关键贡献。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

Motivation: 视频异常检测中存在多尺度时间依赖、视觉语义异构性以及数据标注稀缺等难题。本文旨在通过新架构解决这些复杂挑战。

Method: 提出了DAMS框架，其中主要路径结合了AMTPN和CBAM，另一并行路径利用CLIP进行语义引导，多路径和信息融合机制共同提高了异常事件的表示和识别能力。

Result: 在视频异常检测的UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准上，所述框架表现出色并验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS框架通过双路径和多尺度机制，为视频异常检测提供了系统性解决方案，能够有效处理视频异常相关的多重挑战。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TransPrune的新方法，通过使用Token Transition Variation (TTV)和Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA)来高效修剪视觉语言模型中的多余token，从而在保持模型性能的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模视觉语言模型虽然在多模态学习中表现优异，但由于视觉token数量庞大，推理计算成本很高，因而需要一种高效修剪token的方法来提高推理效率。

Method: 通过观察token转换动力学信号，提出基于Token Transition Variation (TTV)的定位方法评估语义信息变化，并结合Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA)来评判token重要性，逐步剪除低重要性的token，从而无需重新训练即可实现高效推理。

Result: TransPrune在LLaVA-v1.5和LLaVA-Next等模型上测试，8个基准上性能与原模型相当，同时推理计算量降低一半以上。而单独使用TTV无需依赖注意力方法即可达到类似性能水平。

Conclusion: TransPrune是一种高效且无需训练的token修剪方法，既能保持原模型性能，又显著降低计算开销，为LVLM的多模态任务推理提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at
https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效恢复了颜色图，具有平滑性和正确颜色顺序，可扩展至带颜色图例和离散颜色调色板的可视化。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 适用于全校准不可行的场景，适用于多摄像头系统和受限环境，方法简单且适用性广。

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback" (RRVF)的新框架，实现了从原始图像中学习复杂视觉推理，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对精细图文监督的依赖问题，提升视觉推理能力。

Method: 提出RRVF框架，基于验证非对称性原则，通过强化学习训练，采用闭环迭代流程包括推理、渲染与视觉反馈组件，以实现自我校正。

Result: RRVF在数据图表和网页界面图像到代码生成任务上，大幅超越现有开源模型和有监督微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过纯视觉反馈驱动的系统，可构建出更健壮、较少依赖明确监督的通用推理模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available
at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遥感视觉语言研究多依赖于单一来源的数据，且仅限于简单任务，无法统一处理多样化遥感数据。

Method: 提出一种基于RS-VL3M大规模数据构建的模型，引入模态自适应表示（采用分离式嵌入层）和任务特定标记结合高维解码机制的方法。

Result: 实验表明，RingMo-Agent在视觉理解及复杂分析任务中表现出色，且在跨平台和不同感知模态中的泛化能力强。

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent是一种适用于多模态、多平台的遥感数据处理的通用框架，能够显著提升感知与推理的表现。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Method: 生成平衡的人脸数据集，采用两种最新文本到图像生成器（Flux.1-dev和Stable Diffusion v3.5），并结合多个身份增强方法进行分析。

Conclusion: 研究提出了利用合成数据构建更公平人脸识别系统的实用指南。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Motivation: 提高森林高度估计的准确性，以支持气候变化监测和碳循环评估。

Method: 利用梯度提升与多通道SAR数据结合LiDAR数据，在有限的手工设计特征下实现森林高度估计，避免重预处理，支持分类和回归两种范式。

Conclusion: FGump框架能在无需大数据和复杂架构的情况下实现高效且高精度的森林高度估计，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术进步，伪造图片的制作变得更容易，这对确保身份验证的KYC应用构成威胁，激励了开发伪造检测算法的需求。

Method: 研究提出了一个名为FantasyID的新公开数据集，包含真实风格的身份证数据，并模拟了伪造的数字攻击，同时进行了现有算法性能评估。

Result: 现有算法如TruFor, MMFusion等在数据集上的测试条件下性能下降，体现了数据集的复杂性和挑战性。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集适合用作伪造检测算法的评估基准，可推动验证系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional

significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention

remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling

Motivation: 辨别并解决CLIP基础模型在Few-shot分类评估中的问题，通过引入真正归纳的基线评估方法，提升其分类性能的可靠性与准确性。

Method: 提出了一种使用"卸载技术（unlearning）"来创建真正归纳性的Few-shot评估基线，还提出了一种改进的Few-shot分类方法，并通过5880个实验验证。

Result: 在新归纳评估设定下，多数方法表现显著下降（13个基线平均下降55%），但改进的Few-shot分类法在13种最新基线中实现了稳定的最优性能。

Conclusion: 本文指出当前Few-shot评估存在问题，提出了基于卸载技术的解决方案和新的评估基准，并提供了一种分类性能更优的方法，推进了CLIP模型在Few-shot场景中的研究方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code
is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly

Conclusion: 该方法将分割与生成性能有效整合，为高级内容创建、语义编辑及动态场景理解提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Conclusion: OmniBrain提供了一种在真实世界中针对阿尔茨海默症的诊断上鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在自动驾驶中存在局限性，无法应对复杂环境下的可靠性问题。

Method: 设计了混合思维框架（Hybrid-Thinking）与主动感知机制（Active Perception），并采用三级强化学习策略进行训练。

Result: DriveAgent-R1在实验中表现优异，超越现有顶尖多模态模型，同时通过消融实验验证了其决策是基于主动感知的视觉信息。

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为实现更安全、更智能的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

<details>

Motivation: 传统图像和视频去雪方法存在伪影和依赖帧率的缺陷，难以有效解决复杂雪天条件下的图像处理问题。

Method: 利用事件相机的亚毫秒延迟特点，设计基于注意力的模块，专注于事件数据中的雪花遮挡轨迹，恢复背景点的原始强度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了视觉系统在冬季恶劣条件下的可靠性与安全性，为实现全天候应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以应对因全片扫描图像的数字扫描仪差异导致的变异性，这可能影响医疗诊断和治疗，在实际应用中需要提升扫描仪跨领域的泛化能力。

Method: 引入了SCORPION数据集，涵盖480个组织样本，5种扫描仪下生成2400个空间对齐的图像片段用于评估模型一致性。此外，提出了SimCons框架，将基于增强的域泛化技术与一致性损失结合以解决扫描仪泛化问题。

Result: SimCons框架在提高模型对不同扫描仪的一致性方面表现出色，同时保持了任务的特定性能。

Conclusion: 通过发布SCORPION数据集和提出SimCons框架，为研究界提供了验证和提高模型跨扫描仪一致性的重要资源，设立了可靠性测试的新标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Motivation: 现有方法在面对跨域泛化的需求时表现较差，缺乏领域不变表示的学习能力。

Method: 提出了HAMLET-FFD框架，利用对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP），通过知识精炼循环和双向模态融合机制，将视觉证据与概念线索结合，逐步对视觉观察与语义先验对齐来评估真实性。

Result: 实验验证显示，在多个基准数据集上对未见过的伪造形式有出色的泛化性能，同时视觉分析展示了不同嵌入对于细粒度伪造识别的专长。

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD不仅无需调整预训练参数，并可作为CLIP的外插件，在保留原始功能的基础上提升了真实性甄别能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Conclusion: RIS-LAD数据集和SAARN模型为低空无人机场景下的RIS任务提供了新基准和有效解决方案，代码和数据集即将公开。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

### [159] [Exploring text-to-image generation for historical document image retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20934)
*Melissa Cote,Alexandra Branzan Albu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为T2I-QBE的新方法，将文本生成图像技术与基于示例的文档检索（QBE）结合，用于历史文档检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QBE文档检索需要样本文档，但这些样本可能无法获得，为解决这一问题，提出了基于记忆性视觉特征的ABDIR。然而ABDIR存在限制，研究人员探索利用生成式AI弥合QBE与ABDIR之间的差距。

Method: 提出文本到图像生成（T2I）方法，结合ABDIR属性，通过生成查询图像替代传统样本文档进行检索。具体方法是使用Leonardo.Ai生成具有目标视觉特征的查询图像，再通过传统QBE框架进行文档匹配。

Result: 实验表明，在HisIR19历史文档数据集上的应用验证了T2I-QBE方法的可行性，生成的查询图像能有效检索相关文档。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE方法展示了将文本生成图像技术应用于文档图像检索的潜力，是基于生成式AI进行DIR的一种新尝试。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决短视频复杂的视觉元素、高信息密度以及多模态信息融合等难题，为视频搜索、推荐及新兴应用程序提供更好的支持。

Method: 通过视听文本端到端处理实现结构化理解，模型包含7B参数，采用多阶段综合训练，包括预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练及最终指令微调。

Result: 在ShortVid-Bench基准测试及实际性能对比中表现优异，同时支持零样本或少样本微调应用，并在生产环境中明显提高用户参与度和满意度。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video能高效理解短视频，通过10秒推理时间实现对一段1分钟视频的解析，展现了在视频理解和实际应用中的高效和准确性。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

Result: 通过在LRS2和HDTF数据集上的实验验证，该方法展示了在视听同步和生成质量上的显著提升，同时进行了多项消融实验来研究不同部分的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过去除遮罩并优化输入处理流程，大幅提升了生成的说话脸的真实性和同步性，并避免了传统方法的视觉质量和身份细节丢失问题，对音频驱动的面部生成任务有重要意义。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

Motivation: 现有技术在动态环境感知中对时间信息利用不足，主要关注相邻帧的局部交互，缺乏对历史时间序列全局信息的有效利用。

Method: 提出了一种名为GTAD的全局时间聚合去噪网络，包含模型内的去噪网络，用于结合当前时刻的局部时间特征和历史序列的全局时间特征。该方法强调全局与局部信息的结合，通过历史观察获取全局时间模式。

Result: 实验在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准上证明了该方法的优越性，同时通过消融实验进一步验证了其效果。

Conclusion: GTAD方法提供了对动态环境更加连贯和全面的理解，是一种有效利用全局时间信息的新范式，可提升全局3D场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net在可扩展性和任务相关性方面提升了锚点多视图聚类的性能，提供了优化痕迹清晰的深度网络架构。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

### [166] [Security Tensors as a Cross-Modal Bridge: Extending Text-Aligned Safety to Vision in LVLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20994)
*Shen Li,Liuyi Yao,Wujia Niu,Lan Zhang,Yaliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文在大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中引入安全张量，以在推理过程中通过文本或视觉模态应用，并延续文本安全机制以处理跨模态安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM的安全机制在视觉模态上存在空白，需要一种方法将文本安全对准转移到视觉处理中。

Method: 通过可训练的输入向量（安全张量）在推理时应用，并基于一个包含恶意、对比和常规样本的精选数据集对其进行优化，而无需修改模型的参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，安全张量能显著增强LVLM对有害视觉输入的拒绝能力，同时在处理常规任务上几乎不损失性能。

Conclusion: 安全张量能有效激活语言模块的文本安全层，将文本安全扩展到视觉模态，解决了LVLM中的跨模态安全问题。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前康复评估领域研究进展受限于缺乏标准的基准测试、统一的评估协议和可复现的研究方法。

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多教师对抗鲁棒蒸馏方法，通过自适应学习策略提升CNN模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法难以同时兼顾模型精度与鲁棒性，亟需创新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在多种对抗攻击数据上训练多个教师模型，再利用多教师知识蒸馏方式监督学生模型在纯净数据上的学习。设计自适应学习策略，根据模型预测精度动态分配知识权重。

Result: 在MNIST-Digits和Fashion-MNIST数据集上进行了广泛实验，验证了所提方法在多种对抗攻击下提升了CNN模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏与自适应策略的结合能有效提升CNN模型的对抗鲁棒性，展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 现有的面部情感识别系统局限于固定的分类或维度概念，难以捕捉情感的复杂性与细腻性，因此提出通过自然语言作为更灵活的监督信号来改进情感表征学习。

Method: 构建了一个包含10万多样本的情感描述数据集EmoCap100K，并提出EmoCapCLIP框架，采用全局-局部对比学习与跨模态正样本挖掘模块，充分利用多层次自然语言信息。

Result: 实验表明，EmoCapCLIP在超过20个基准测试的五个任务中表现优异，验证了通过丰富的自然语言描述学习情感表征的可行性和优越性。

Conclusion: 基于语义丰富的自然语言描述可以显著提升面部情感表征的效果，为面部情感识别领域提供了一种更具普适性和解释性的思路，并展示了广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/sunlicai/EmoCapCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的公开数据集，包含150多万个高质量图像编辑三元组（指令、源图像、编辑后图像），并证明其对开放源代码模型微调效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前高质量多模态模型（如GPT-4o）的专有性质为开放研究带来了障碍，因此需要一个公开的高质量数据集来推动这一领域的发展。

Method: 通过整合三个流行的图像编辑数据集（OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, UltraEdit）并利用GPT-4o的能力进行图像和指令的再生成与优化，构建出GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M数据集。

Result: 实验表明，基于该数据集微调的模型性能显著优于以往开源方法，例如FluxKontext在多个基准测试中表现出色，大幅缩小了与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M数据集的发布为指令引导的图像编辑开放性研究提供了资源基础，并希望能进一步推动该领域的创新。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望解决当前4D场景重建领域中缺乏全面分层分析的问题。

Method: 提出一个框架，将4D空间智能方法分为五级：从3D低级属性重建，到包含物理规则和约束的高级建模。

Result: 对现有方法进行分类与分析，总结了每个层级面临的挑战，并提出未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 分类框架为4D空间智能研究提供了新视角，有助于未来更丰富的场景理解与构建。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date
project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.

Motivation: 面对日益严重的心理健康问题，开发早期检测和监控的自动化工具变得尤为重要。

Method: 对多种转换器模型（如BERT、RoBERTa等）与基于LSTM的传统方法进行对比，采用不同的文本嵌入技术，并使用一个大型标注数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，转换器模型性能明显优于LSTM方法，尤其是RoBERTa模型，F1分数分别为99.54%（测试集）和96.05%（外部数据集）。

Conclusion: 转换器模型在心理健康实时监控中表现出色，但需要权衡计算资源需求，LSTM加BERT嵌入也表现出极强的竞争力。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文献数量暴增，使得研究者急需更高效的方法来组织、比较和对比文献资料。大语言模型可以通过生成共享比较方面的架构来支持这一需求。

Method: 1. 增强无标注表格语料库并生成相关意图数据集，以减少模糊性。2. 提出了多个基于LLM的架构编辑技术，并对单次架构生成方法进行了基准评测，包含提示式工作流和微调模型。

Result: 证明了通过表格意图提升表现的有效性，并展示编辑技术能进一步优化生成的架构。

Conclusion: 小型开放权重模型通过微调即可与SOTA提示型模型竞争，再加上编辑技术能使生成架构更加优化。

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,
reuse, and semantic interoperability of knowledge resources. WOKIE combines
external translation services with targeted refinement using Large Language
Models (LLMs), balancing translation quality, scalability, and cost. Designed
to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,
and ontology matching improvements. Our results show that WOKIE is suitable to
enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在地理空间领域上有较多应用，但其错误的地理空间知识会导致幻觉问题，影响模型的可靠性。因此，需要系统地评估与降低这类幻觉现象。

Method: 该研究提出了利用结构化地理空间知识图进行评估的框架，并采用基于Kahneman-Tversky优化算法的动态事实对齐方法，减少地理空间幻觉。

Result: 在20种先进LLMs上的实验表明，新方法可以显著减少幻觉问题，性能在基准测试上提升超过29.6%。

Conclusion: 该框架和学习算法有效提升了LLMs在地理空间知识和推理任务中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 本文为高效语言模型设计提供理论与实践指导，推进长文本处理能力及模型可扩展性。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

Conclusion: 代码生成模型在多轮恶意对话中存在鲁棒性问题，新设计的基准和改进的训练方法可以有效提升模型的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

Motivation: 解决低资源情境下的语言翻译问题，提高翻译质量。

Method: 将预训练的Whisper ASR模型与专注于Indic语言的Krutrim大型语言模型（LLM）相结合，采用端到端系统；同时探讨了链式思维（CoT）方法对质量提升的作用。

Result: 系统在英-印方向获得了28.88的平均BLEU分数，在印-英方向获得了27.86的平均BLEU分数；CoT方法对某些翻译方向显示出显著改进（如泰米尔语到英语提高了13.84 BLEU），但存在一致性挑战。

Conclusion: 融合预训练模型和专用LLM的端到端方法在低资源场景下表现优秀，CoT方法的潜力值得进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

Motivation: 现有基准在评估多语言和多模态能力方面存在局限性，例如仅限英语、专注于单一模态或短文本、缺乏人工注释等，因此提出了设计一个全面覆盖语言和模态的基准的必要性。

Method: 本文提出了MCIF基准，基于科学演讲，覆盖语音、视觉、文本三个核心模态，涵盖英语、德语、意大利语和中文四种语言，并包含人类标注的短文本和长文本输入。

Result: 通过MCIF，可以系统地评估MLLMs在跨语言和多模态场景下的指令跟随能力，填补了现有基准中的空白。

Conclusion: MCIF作为一个公开发布的基准（采用CC-BY 4.0许可证），为MLLMs研究和发展提供了一个全面的评估工具，助力多模态语言模型的进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）在罗马尼亚驾驶法教育任务中的表现，引入了一个名为RoD-TAL的新多模态数据集，并通过多种技术提升其信息检索和问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马尼亚语作为一种资源不足的语言，法律教育尤其是驾驶法律学习存在工具匮乏的现状，研究旨在探索如何利用AI来改进这些法律教育工具。

Method: 引入了一个名为RoD-TAL的新数据集，该数据集包含罗马尼亚驾驶法律的文本和图像问题。同时采用了检索增强生成（RAG）管道、密集检索器以及针对推理优化的模型，评估了多项任务如信息检索、问答、视觉信息检索和视觉问答的性能。

Result: 领域特定的微调显著提升了检索性能，并且链式思维提示和专门的推理模型提高了问答准确率，超过了驾驶考试的及格分。然而，视觉推理任务仍然面临挑战。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs和VLMs在法律教育中的潜力得以证明，但视觉推理的挑战暴露了它们的局限性，仍需进一步优化和研究。

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多语言和单语言LLMs在阿拉伯语、英语和部分印度语系语言中的表现，并研究了剪枝和量化等压缩策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究当前LLMs在低资源语言环境下的能力，尤其是在语言多样性和资源稀缺场景下的表现。

Method: 对比多语言和单语言模型，如BLOOMZ、AceGPT、Jais、LLaMA-2等，并测试压缩策略（4位/8位量化和剪枝）对性能的影响。

Result: 多语言模型整体表现优于单语言模型；量化维持准确性的同时提升效率，但激进的剪枝对大模型的性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 多语言转移学习在低资源环境中显著有效，未来需要关注减少幻觉性和泛化错误的干预策略。

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

*Ronak Upasham,Tathagata Dey,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的三阶段流水线方法，结合中间表示，生成包含主观性和客观性文本的Table-to-Text生成模型，表现优于多种现有大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2T生成领域关注于生成客观的表格描述，但生成带有主观性的解释性文本尚未得到足够研究。因此需要探索能在表格和主观性文本间构建关系的生成方法。

Method: 方法包括：1) 提取资源描述框架(RDF)三元组，2) 将文本聚合为连贯的叙述，3) 融入主观性以丰富生成文本。

Result: 利用经过微调的小型T5模型，在多个指标上性能优于Mistral-7B和Llama-2，同时与GPT-3.5表现相当。

Conclusion: 首次提出基于中间表示的结构化流水线模型，可有效平衡表述的事实准确性和主观解释性，推动T2T生成领域发展。

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为基本阅读蒸馏（BRD）的方法，使小模型通过模仿大语言模型（LLMs）的基本阅读行为，可以在多个任务中表现接近甚至优于大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高计算资源限制了LLMs的实际应用，而现有的蒸馏方法忽略了小模型在与下游任务无关的通用文本上的基础阅读教育。

Method: 提出基本阅读蒸馏（BRD），通过训练小模型模仿LLMs的基本阅读行为，如命名实体识别、提问和回答。

Result: 小模型在语言推理基准和BIG-bench任务中表现可与大20倍的模型相当或更优，分析表明BRD能有效地影响模型的概率分布，并与现有蒸馏方法互补。

Conclusion: BRD为小模型提供了一种高效的基础教育方式，不仅提升性能，还具有与知识蒸馏和任务蒸馏互补的特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

Conclusion: JT-Math-8B证明了系统化优化流程和精心设计训练策略的有效性，为数学推理和通用人工智能的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

TL;DR: 本文运用计算工具研究美国福音派运动中的基督教小说，通过标注并分析“上帝行为”，发现其性别和作品间的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基督教小说及“上帝行为”的描绘，以弥补对该类型文学研究的不足。

Method: 通过人工标注建立相关定义及编码手册，并结合轻量语言模型和大规模模型完成自动标注与分析。

Result: 语言模型能够媲美人工标注效果，发现《末日迷踪》与其他基督教小说及性别作者间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 利用计算工具可有效分析文学题材，揭示其内部主题及性别差异。

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UloRL的强化学习方法，解决大型语言模型超长输出训练中的效率问题，显著提升了推理能力及性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高大型语言模型在生成超长序列时的推理能力，并克服传统强化学习在处理超长输出时的效率低下问题。

Method: 提出一种Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) 方法，将超长输出解码分段处理，同时引入动态掩码机制避免信息熵崩塌问题。

Result: UloRL方法在Qwen3-30B-A3B模型上的训练速度提高了2.06倍，同时在AIME2025和BeyondAIME基准测试中分别提升性能至85.1%和61.9%，甚至超越了更大的Qwen3-235B-A22B模型。

Conclusion: UloRL方法显著提高了大型语言模型在生成超长序列时的推理能力和性能，展示了极大的应用潜力，并计划公开代码与模型以供社区研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Flora，一种无需人工或LLMs干预的方法，通过组合短指令和生成基于长上下文元指令的响应，提升LLMs的长上下文性能，同时轻微影响其短上下文表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在处理长上下文时面临稀有长文本、高计算需求以及短上下文能力的明显下降等挑战，需要更高效的方法来改进长上下文表现。

Method: 提出一种名为Flora的策略，通过分类组合短指令生成长上下文训练数据，使LLMs能够在丰富的多样数据中训练，同时维持短上下文能力。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和QwQ-32B模型的实验中，搭载Flora的模型在三大长上下文基准测试中表现更优，同时保持短上下文任务的强劲表现。

Conclusion: Flora无需依赖人工或LLMs干预即可构造多样化长上下文，为提升LLMs长上下文性能提供了有效途径，影响短上下文表现的幅度微小，实用性强。

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HCAttention的新框架，能够在极端内存约束下进行高效推理，同时保持模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于注意力机制中Key-Value缓存的内存需求巨大，长上下文输入的处理在大语言模型中面临挑战。而现有的缓存压缩方法在内存减少超过85%时性能会显著下降。此外，在GPU-CPU协作下实现近似注意力的方法尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出HCAttention框架，将关键量化、值卸载和动态KV逐出机制结合，实现高效的注意力计算，无需对现有Transformer架构进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，HCAttention在将KV缓存内存缩减至原始大小的25%下，能保持全注意力模型的准确性，甚至在缩减至12.5%时仍表现出色，并在KV缓存压缩领域达到了新的领先水平。

Conclusion: HCAttention首次实现了在单张80GB A100 GPU上扩展Llama-3-8B模型处理400万Token，表现优异，并提供了一种兼容性和效率均优的解决方案。

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为DiscoDrive的合成对话语料库，包含3500个跨七个汽车场景的多轮对话，用于解决现有数据集未能捕捉真实驾驶员与AI对话中不流利特征的问题，并通过实验验证了其训练和数据增强的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据集难以捕捉到真实驾驶场景下人机对话中常见的不流利现象（如犹豫、重复、自我纠正等）。

Method: 采用两阶段的提示驱动生成管线，动态地将不流利特征融入对话生成，最终生成涵盖七个汽车领域的3500个多轮对话语料库。

Result: 通过实验证明，DiscoDrive在训练资源和低资源场景数据增强中均表现优异，使模型在多个评价指标上实现显著提升，如BLEU-4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和BERTScore等，还在自然性和连贯性上超过现有方法。

Conclusion: DiscoDrive填补了现有资源的空白，是一个高效的训练和数据增强资源，使得对话式AI能够更鲁棒地应对真实世界的不流利车载交互场景。

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Claude-3-Opus在准确性上接近人类，但多模态问题表现较弱，且模型语言间的表现差异明显。

Conclusion: 需进一步在不同语言和临床环境中评估生成式AI，并通过改进训练方法、多模态推理及临床整合提升模型性能。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

### [193] [CaliDrop: KV Cache Compression with Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19906)
*Yi Su,Quantong Qiu,Yuechi Zhou,Juntao Li,Qingrong Xia,Ping Li,Xinyu Duan,Zhefeng Wang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章研究了在长序列场景下使用KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，并提出了一种校准驱动的代币移除策略CaliDrop。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存虽然能加速生成，但内存需求随着序列长度、批大小和模型大小线性增长，尤其在长上下文场景下形成瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种名为CaliDrop的策略，通过观察相近位置查询高相似的特点，对移除的代币进行校准以减少因代币移除带来的准确性下降。

Result: 实验表明，CaliDrop显著提高了现有代币移除方法的准确性。

Conclusion: CaliDrop有效缓解了内存瓶颈问题的同时，较少影响生成过程的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

*Seorin Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出KLAAD，一个基于注意力的偏差消除框架，通过隐式对齐刻板印象和反刻板印象句子的注意力分布，减少模型中的社会偏见输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在生成输出中存在的社会偏见问题，同时尽量保持语言生成质量。

Method: 采用KLAAD框架，通过结合交叉熵、KL散度和三元损失的复合训练目标，隐式对齐注意力分布，而不直接修改模型权重。

Result: 在BBQ和BOLD基准测试上展示了偏差缓解的改进，同时对语言建模质量的影响最小。

Conclusion: 注意力层级的对齐是一种缓解生成式语言模型中偏差的合理解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在从自然语言生成可视化方面存在潜力，但缺乏全面的基准测试来评估其能力和挑战。

Method: 设计了一个包含1,985个样本的基准测试框架（Text2Vis），涵盖20多种图表类型和多种数据科学问题，并提出跨模态actor-critic框架以提升模型的文本答案和可视化代码质量。

Result: 通过对11种模型进行基准测试，结果发现性能差距显著；采用提出的框架后，GPT-4o通过率从26%提升至42%，图表质量得以改进。

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data
interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations
from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the
rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark
designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and
diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier
detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a
data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and
annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,
and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source
models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,
and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose
the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the
textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%
to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce
an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment
across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer
correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart
accuracy. We release Text2Vis at https://github.com/vis-nlp/Text2Vis.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在AP中文考试写作任务评分中的可靠性，通过比较人类评分者和AI评分者的一致性发现了差异和潜在优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估LLMs在写作任务评分中的表现，并比较其与人类评分者的一致性，希望为其在大规模评估中的应用提供依据。

Method: 利用广义理论，比较人类和7个AI评分者在两类AP中文写作任务（故事叙述和电子邮件回应）中的评分一致性，使用整体评分和任务完成、表达和语言运用三个领域得分进行分析。

Result: 人类评分者在总体上提供更可靠的分数，但LLMs在特定条件下表现出合理的一致性，特别是在故事叙述任务中，混合使用人类和AI评分的模型提高了可靠性。

Conclusion: 混合评分模型具有潜力，可能为大规模写作评估提供更高的可靠性。

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个专注于越南法律领域的高质量资源，为低资源语言的法律文本处理提供了重要支持，同时强调了人工智能完全自动化法律任务的长期挑战。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在F1和AUC评分上优于强基准模型，并成功在包括SMS垃圾信息、COVID-19假新闻及仇恨言论等领域的测试数据中验证性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合元学习的异常检测方法在少样本的语言异常检测任务中具备明显优势，同时代码与基准的开源可进一步促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong
baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to
facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为FAEDKV的无训练KV缓存压缩框架，通过将KV缓存转换为频率域来有效地保存上下文信息，与现有方法相比性能提升22%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前KV缓存压缩中偏态问题及高成本，并在保证效率的情况下兼顾早期和近期信息。

Method: 提出一种新的频域变换方法（IWDFT），实现了一种频率自适应的KV缓存压缩框架（FAEDKV），无需模型重新训练。

Result: FAEDKV在LongBench基准测试上表现出比现有方法高22%的优越性能，并在位置无关的检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: FAEDKV实现了对KV缓存公平且高效的压缩，为长上下文任务中的LLMs提供了先进的支持。

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从文本生成复杂统计信息图的任务，并为此构建了首个基准数据集和处理框架Infogen，其表现优于现有解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有研究集中于生成简单图表，而未关注从文本生成复杂统计信息图这一领域的缺位。

Method: 定义信息图元数据结构，构建Infodat数据集，并提出Infogen框架，通过两阶段方法生成图表元数据并转化为代码。

Result: Infogen在Infodat基准数据集上的表现优于现有开源及闭源的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂统计信息图的生成提供了新的解决思路，同时引入了首个基准数据集，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种编译器框架，通过新的中间表示和形状分析将神经网络的神经元级规格自动翻译为张量级实现，以便简化和优化认证器的开发，同时引入新的压缩格式g-BCSR提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于抽象解释的DNN认证器开发复杂且需要高程度的专业知识，且现有工具支持有限，无法灵活地开发新的认证器或适应不同应用。

Method: 引入一个编译器框架，通过堆栈式中间表示和形状分析，从神经元级规格生成张量实现，并引入g-BCSR压缩格式以高效表示稀疏性张量操作。

Result: 框架提高了认证器开发的可扩展性和灵活性，并展现出与手工优化实现相当的性能，同时新压缩格式能有效处理无法很好对齐现有格式的稀疏性模式。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了设计认证器的门槛，使得开发更加灵活简便，有助于在广泛的DNN中分析和探索认证器的实用性，性能上仍能与高性能手工实现匹敌。

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

TL;DR: 本文对RAG在多样化检索场景中的表现进行了深入评估，发现其在实际应用中存在多种局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估RAG在大规模异构数据存储中的有效性，并揭示其在现实场景下的实际表现和潜在问题。

Method: 利用MassiveDS数据集，量化分析RAG系统在异构知识源中的检索性能，包括模型大小的影响以及不同检索源的表现。

Result: 发现较小模型从检索中受益更多，重排器贡献有限，无单一检索源始终优越；现有LLMs难以有效管理多样化知识源。

Conclusion: 在实际应用中需开发更自适应的检索策略以提升RAG系统的实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can
be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProsodyLM，一种能够更好学习和处理语音内容与韵律关系的模型，通过一种新的标记化方案来保留并利用更多韵律信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前主流的语音语言模型通过将语音转换为离散标记输入LLMs，这样的方式在学习韵律信息上效果欠佳，模型在预训练阶段尚未显现有效的韵律处理能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的标记化方法，先将语音转录为文本，然后生成一系列基于单词级别的韵律标记，从而保留更多韵律信息并使其更易于文本语言模型理解。

Result: 通过新方法预训练的ProsodyLM显示出多样化的韵律处理能力，包括生成语音时利用韵律细节（如对比性焦点）、理解语气情绪以及保持长段文本的韵律一致性等。

Conclusion: 采用新标记化方案的ProsodyLM在捕捉内容和韵律的复杂相互依赖性方面显示出显著的改进，证明了其在这一领域的潜力。

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

Motivation: 古英语等古代语言资源稀缺，限制了其在现代自然语言处理技术中的应用，此研究旨在填补这一领域的空白。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（LoRA）、通过反向翻译的数据增强、以及内容生成与翻译分离的双代理管道来生成古英语文本。

Result: 提出的方法在自动评估指标（BLEU、METEOR、CHRF）上显著优于基线模型，BLEU分数从26提升至65以上；人工评估显示文本具有高语法准确性和风格一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩展了古英语语料库，还为其他濒危语言的保护和复兴提供了切实可行的方案。

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的轻量化自动化提示词优化方法Sem-DPO，用于保持语义一致性并提高生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前生成AI生成的图像对提示词的表达敏感，而现有方法可能导致语义偏移问题，亟需改进。

Method: 通过在DPO损失中加入基于嵌入空间余弦距离的指数权重，降低语义不匹配提示词的训练信号权重，同时限制语义漂移。

Result: 在三个文本到图像提示词优化基准和两个语言模型上，Sem-DPO相比DPO提高了8-12%的CLIP相似性和5-9%的人类偏好分数，并超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Sem-DPO的语义加权方法在提示词优化上表现优越，建议作为未来研究的标准，且为语言模型中的语义感知偏好优化奠定基础。

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in
https://github.com/wangk0b/Multi_Agentic_QA_Long_Doc.git. Sample Question and
Answer (QA) pairs and structured system prompts can be found in the Appendix.

### [208] [Goal Alignment in LLM-Based User Simulators for Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20152)
*Shuhaib Mehri,Xiaocheng Yang,Takyoung Kim,Gokhan Tur,Shikib Mehri,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对当前大型语言模型在多轮对话中难以持续表现出目标导向性行为的问题，提出了一种新框架用户目标状态跟踪(UGST)，并开发了一种三阶段式的方法及评价指标，可显著提升用户模拟器的目标对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在多轮对话中缺乏一致目标导向行为的问题，提高用户模拟器在对话交互中的可靠性。

Method: 设计了用户目标状态跟踪(UGST)框架，并围绕其开发三阶段式的方法，用于自主跟踪用户目标的进展并生成与目标对齐的响应，还提出了综合评价指标来衡量用户模拟器的目标对齐性。

Result: 在两个基准测试（MultiWOZ 2.4 和 τ-Bench）上验证方法的优越性，显著提升了用户模拟器对齐目标的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了对话式AI领域的重要空白，确立了UGST作为开发目标对齐用户模拟器的关键框架的重要性。

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

*Hyeonji Lee,Daejin Jo,Seohwan Yun,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的自我生成偏好优化框架(SGPO)，通过一种自我改进机制实现语言模型对人类偏好的高效对齐，无需外部偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在对齐人类偏好时依赖于人工标注数据，存在分布转移等问题，限制了模型的广泛应用。

Method: 提出了一个基于自我改进机制的SGPO框架，其中改进器优化生成偏好数据用于直接优化策略模型，改进器与策略模型基于同一模型，通过逐步改进生成更高质量的偏好数据。

Result: 实验表明，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard数据集上，SGPO方法显著优于现有的DPO方法和其他自我改进方法。

Conclusion: SGPO框架有效地实现了无需外部偏好数据的语言模型偏好对齐，为语言模型的实际应用提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为SessionIntentBench的多模态基准，用以评估LV(L)LM在跨会话意图理解上的能力，并发现现有模型在复杂会话情境下表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作在电子商务产品购买会话中缺乏对用户意图的有效建模，且缺少相应数据和基准。

Method: 引入意图树的概念，设计数据集构建流程，构建多模态基准SessionIntentBench，并进行了人工标注以获得评估黄金集。

Result: 实验显示现有LV(L)LM无法有效捕捉复杂会话意图，但注入意图信息可显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SessionIntentBench为用户意图理解提供了一种新型可扩展的数据利用方式，并揭示了现有模型在意图建模方面的不足。

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiRole-R1框架，通过增强多角色视角的多样性，以改善大型推理模型在主观性推理任务中的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受发现增加角色视角能够持续改善性能的启发，作者提出解决现有模型在主观性问题上效果有限的问题，主要由于其推理趋于同质化。

Method: 引入一个无监督的数据构造管道以生成包含多样视角的推理链，并利用包含奖励塑造的群组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行强化学习，将多样性作为奖励信号之一。

Result: 实验结果表明，MultiRole-R1在六个基准测试中均有效提升了主观性和客观性推理的性能，验证了推理多样性与准确性之间的正相关性。

Conclusion: 多样性增强训练方法在改进大型推理模型的主观性任务表现上具有很大潜力，并促进了推理和语言的多样性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新评估方法，通过因子分析揭示决定大语言模型（LLMs）表现的潜在技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估方法主要依赖于基准测试分数，难以全面理解模型技能。

Method: 引入因子分析，分析多个基准测试中的任务关系，揭示潜在技能，并开发相关工具。

Result: 建立新的排行榜，对60个LLMs在44个任务上的表现进行分析，发现少量潜在技能可以解释模型表现。

Conclusion: 新方法能更全面地评估模型技能，并提供优化冗余任务和选择最佳模型的工具。

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Co-NAML-LSTUR的混合新闻推荐框架，有效地结合多视角新闻建模与用户短期和长期兴趣建模，显著提高推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前新闻推荐系统难以同时有效建模多视角新闻表示及用户兴趣的动态性，且现有方法在抓取用户跨时间尺度偏好方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了结合多视角新闻建模的NAML模型和用户短期与长期表示的LSTUR模型的框架，利用BERT词嵌入增强语义特征提取能力，并在MIND-small和MIND-large数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，Co-NAML-LSTUR在MIND-small和MIND-large数据集上均明显优于多数现有的先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 多视角新闻表示和双尺度用户建模的结合是提升新闻推荐系统性能的有效方法，验证了所提出框架的优越性。

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at
https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的综合框架，通过INT（交互式叙事治疗师）和IMA（创新时刻评估），利用大语言模型来模拟专业心理治疗师并评估治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大语言模型在心理健康支持中的应用缺乏对专门心理治疗的真实模拟，以及对治疗过程随时间推移的反映，叙事治疗因访问限制和社会污名化而未被充分利用。

Method: 提出一个框架，包括两个核心组件：INT，通过规划治疗阶段、引导反思水平和生成上下文合适的专家级响应来模拟叙事治疗师；IMA，通过跟踪客户语音中的“创新时刻”来量化治疗进展并评估效果。

Result: 在260个模拟客户和230个人类参与者的实验中，INT在治疗质量和深度上显著优于标准大语言模型。

Conclusion: INT和IMA框架为心理健康支持提供了高质量的对话，并展现了其在社会应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

Motivation: 探索如何利用语言特征评估和建模高风险领域专家交流中的专业性，尤其是财务分析师提问中的专业性。

Method: 提出了一种注释框架，用于量化问题的结构和语用要素。构建了两个数据集（一个带有感知专业性注释，另一个标明问题来源），对比大语言模型生成的问题与人为问题，并训练分类器。

Result: 结果表明，语言特征与专业性和问题来源密切相关，分类器性能优于基准模型（gemini-2.0和SVM）。

Conclusion: 证明了专业性是可以通过语言建模学习到的跨领域通用概念。

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为完成后学习（PCL）的新型训练框架，通过利用模型输出后的序列空间来增强推理和自我评估能力，从而改进语言模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型训练在遇到序列结束标记（<eos>）后停止学习，忽视了后续空间中的潜在学习机会，因此提出PCL以进一步提高推理和评估性能。

Method: 设计了白盒强化学习方法，让模型根据奖励规则评估输出内容，并将评分与奖励函数对齐进行监督，通过双轨SFT优化推理和评估能力，同时与RL训练结合实现多目标混合优化。

Result: 实验结果表明在不同数据集和模型上，PCL方法相比传统的SFT和RL方法具有一致性能提升效果。

Conclusion: PCL为语言模型的训练提供了新技术路径，在保留部署效率的同时提升了输出质量。

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种评估隐性观点表达的框架，旨在改善对多样化社会视角的包容性表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在对话中多通过提及用户人口统计或社群行为属性实现表面包容，忽视了隐含的观点表达，可能导致误导或加强刻板印象。

Method: 通过构建立场响应的模型框架评估观点表达，并结合正无标签学习法与指令调教语言模型评估训练后对齐情况。

Result: 模型展示了在评估规范性社会观点和修正隐性表达中的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究为隐性观点的表示与更包容的模型行为提供了实际路径。

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出MoL-RL训练范式，通过双目标优化框架将多步环境反馈信号整合到大语言模型中，并在数学推理和代码生成任务上取得了SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型难以有效利用自然语言评价等序列环境反馈信号，而现有方法存在信息丢失或无法利用多步反馈交互的局限。

Method: 提出MoL-RL，结合MoL连续训练（解耦领域特定反馈信号和语言能力）与基于GRPO的后训练，以单步推断方式整合多步反馈交互。

Result: 在数学推理（MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25）和代码生成（CodeAgent-Test）基准上，采用Qwen3-8B模型实现SOTA，同时保持跨模型规模的强泛化能力（Qwen3-4B）。

Conclusion: MoL-RL有效增强了LLM在多领域的推理能力，为利用多步文本反馈改进语言模型提供了一个有前景的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言训练的语言模型在翻译、代码混合等任务中的表现及其内部语言处理方式。

Method: 采用logit lens和神经元专业化分析，研究模型处理翻译、代码混合任务时的语言表征激活模式及神经元特性。

Result: 发现Aya-23会激活语言学相关表征来处理翻译任务，代码混合输入的处理受基准语言影响较大，代码混合输入的语言特定神经元集中在模型后期层次，且脚本相似性和语言类型关系影响神经元处理方式。

Conclusion: 多语言训练显著影响语言模型的内部语言处理机制，这一发现对跨语言迁移研究有积极意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯方言与现代标准阿拉伯语的差异限制了数字服务和教育资源的可及性，并阻碍了阿拉伯语机器翻译的进展。

Method: 评估了六种大型语言模型(LLMs)的提示策略，并结合资源高效的微调管道，例如少样本和零样本提示技巧以及Gemma2-9B模型的量化微调。

Result: GPT-4o在所有提示设置中表现最佳，量化的Gemma2-9B模型在CHrF++评分中取得49.88分，超过GPT-4o的44.58分。此外，多方言联合训练模型相比单方言模型提升超过10% CHrF++，4-bit量化减少了60%的内存使用，但性能损失不足1%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即便在资源有限的情况下，高质量的DA-MSA机器翻译是可实现的，为更具包容性的语言技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with
articulatory-acoustic modules.

### [222] [RMTBench: Benchmarking LLMs Through Multi-Turn User-Centric Role-Playing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20352)
*Hao Xiang,Tianyi Tang,Yang Su,Bowen Yu,An Yang,Fei Huang,Yichang Zhang,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Xianpei Han,Jingren Zhou,Junyang Lin,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的名为RMTBench的双语角色扮演基准，用以评估大语言模型（LLMs）的角色扮演能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于依赖角色背景描述，使用简化的Q&A任务，难以真实反映实际使用场景的需求。

Method: RMTBench通过设计包含80个角色和8000+对话轮的多场景基准，用基于用户动机驱动的方式构建多轮对话，并采用LLM评分进行多维度评估。

Result: 基于RMTBench的实验显示，该方法实现了对角色扮演对话复杂意图的捕捉，有效填补了学术评估与实际部署需求之间的空白。

Conclusion: RMTBench提供了更符合实际应用需求的评估方法，助力推进LLMs在角色扮演场景中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

### [223] [Length Representations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20398)
*Sangjun Moon,Dasom Choi,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)如何在内部表示中编码输出序列长度的信息，并发现多头注意力机制在控制长度方面至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs可以控制输出长度，但其机制尚未探明，本文旨在探索LLMs内部对输出长度的处理方式。

Method: 通过实验分析LLMs内部表示，研究其在多头注意力机制中对序列长度的控制，观察特定隐藏单元的行为。

Result: 研究发现特定隐藏单元与输出长度控制相关，可以通过调整这些单元的激活强度精确控制输出长度，同时保持生成文本的信息量。

Conclusion: LLMs已经学会了无需外部控制的内部长度控制机制，这种机制在语义与长度间部分解耦，具备鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

### [224] [Cognitive Chain-of-Thought: Structured Multimodal Reasoning about Social Situations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20409)
*Eunkyu Park,Wesley Hanwen Deng,Gunhee Kim,Motahhare Eslami,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章介绍了一种新的提示方法——Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT)，适用于需要视觉、理解和判断结合的任务，显示出相比传统方法显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉任务中引入链式推理（CoT）方法常常不够有效，尤其是在与社会语境相关的任务中，这些任务需要将感知与规范性判断相结合。

Method: 提出Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT)提示策略，借鉴认知过程，将任务拆分为三个阶段：感知（perception）、情境（situation）和规范（norm）。利用此分阶段方法引导多模态大模型的推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试（包括意图判别、常识推理和安全性任务）上，CoCoT较传统CoT和直接提示方法平均提升8%的表现。

Conclusion: 采用认知阶段性分析增强了视觉-语言模型的可解释性和社会语境意识，为更安全、可靠的多模态系统指出了方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

*George Ibrahim,Rita Ramos,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CONCAP的多语言图像描述生成模型，通过检索相关语言的描述并结合图像特定的概念，提升了多语言图像描述的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多语言图像描述生成性能较英文模型的差距，以及减少多语言训练数据与模型参数的需求。

Method: 模型结合了检索到的目标语言的描述，并引入了图像特定的概念，改进了多语言的上下文化处理及描述生成准确性。

Result: 在XM3600数据集实验上表现突出，尤其在低资源和中等资源语言上性能优异，同时数据需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 验证了基于概念感知的检索增强方法在提升多语言图像描述生成任务中的有效性，并弥合了多语言性能差距。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

*Khloud AL Jallad,Nada Ghneim,Ghaida Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本综述探讨了多语言自然语言理解（NLU）基准，特别是其诊断数据集及覆盖的语言学现象，提出建立统一评估标准的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近几年NLU能力评估成为热门研究话题，导致诸多基准的开发，但却缺乏一个标准化的评估体系或命名约定。

Method: 综述并比较了当前英文、阿拉伯语及多语言NLU基准，深入分析其在语言学现象覆盖方面的优劣，提出研究问题以制定评估标准。

Result: 发现不同基准在诊断数据集覆盖及细粒度错误分析能力上各有长短，同时指出缺乏统一评估指标的问题。

Conclusion: 统一的诊断评估标准有助于更深入地解析NLU模型在不同基准下的表现，从而支持未来构建全球语言现象层级体系。

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

*Sungwoo Han,Hyeyeon Kim,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代码提示的方法，用于改进ChatGPT等大型语言模型（LLM）在命名实体识别（NER）任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖输入上下文信息，忽略了NER对详细标注要求的捕捉能力，这导致了识别效果的局限性。

Method: 通过在提示中嵌入代码，提供详细的BIO标注方案指令，利用LLM对编程语言中长作用域理解的能力，提出了代码提示方法，并结合chain-of-thought提示进行优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，在十个不同语言的数据集上（包括英语、阿拉伯语、芬兰语、丹麦语和德语），代码提示方法优于传统文本提示方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 代码提示通过清晰的NER结构化指令改善了LLM的识别能力，结合链式思维提示进一步提高了效果。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Text-JEPA的轻量框架，能够将自然语言转换为一阶逻辑，以实现高效和具解释性的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高封闭领域（如教育、医疗、法律）的问答系统性能，力求在生成准确答案的同时实现透明的推理过程和解释。

Method: 设计了Text-JEPA框架，结合了双系统认知理论，通过自然语言转化为一阶逻辑表示（System 1），并结合Z3求解器（System 2）进行逻辑推理，同时提出三种评估指标来验证框架的效果。

Result: 实验证明，Text-JEPA在领域特定数据集上取得了与大型语言模型系统相近的性能，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: Text-JEPA展示出构建高效、解释性问答系统的潜力，尤其适用于专用领域。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

Conclusion: AQUA及其AQUADAPT框架为水产养殖研究与智能系统增添了新的可能性，为该行业解决长期存在的挑战提供了前景。

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

Motivation: 当前缺乏高难度和新颖的数学训练数据，限制了高效数学推理大语言模型的发展。

Method: 采用SAND-Math流水线，包含两个主要步骤：1) 高质量数学问题的生成；2) 通过新颖的“难度提升”操作系统性地增加问题复杂性。

Result: 使用SAND-Math数据显著提高了模型在AIME25基准测试中的表现，相较次优数据集提升了17.85个百分点。此外，难度提升步骤将问题难度从5.02提升至5.98，使得模型表现从46.38%提高到49.23%。

Conclusion: SAND-Math注重复杂问题生成及优化，为开发更高效的数学推理能力工具提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty
Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key
findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-labeled scheme for joint annotation of hate and
counter-hate speech in social media conversations, categorizing hate and
counter-hate messages into thematic and rhetorical dimensions. The thematic
categories outline different discursive aspects of each type of speech, while
the rhetorical dimension captures how hate and counter messages are
communicated, drawing on Aristotle's Logos, Ethos and Pathos. We annotate a
sample of 92 conversations, consisting of 720 tweets, and conduct statistical
analyses, incorporating public metrics, to explore patterns of interaction
between the thematic and rhetorical dimensions within and between hate and
counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate
messages on social media, the strategies used to counter them, and their
potential impact on online behavior.

increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has
become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的本体增强知识图谱补全方法（OL-KGC），通过神经感知和本体知识相结合实现更高效的知识推理能力，实验结果表明其在多项评估指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的LLM-based知识图谱补全方法由于依赖隐式知识表示且存在错误传播问题，难以实现明确的推理结果，因此需要开发能够结合神经结构信息与本体知识的方法来提升推理能力。

Method: 提出了OL-KGC方法，首先引入神经感知机制将结构信息嵌入到文本空间中，然后通过自动化提取算法从需要补全的知识图谱中提取本体知识，将其转化成LLMs理解的文本格式，从而为知识推理提供逻辑指导。

Result: 在FB15K-237、UMLS和WN18RR三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，OL-KGC在多项评估指标上显著优于现有的主流知识图谱补全方法，达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: 结合神经感知结构信息和本体知识可以显著提升LLMs在知识图谱补全中的性能，验证了OL-KGC方法的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO)，一种更稳定的政策优化方法，旨在解决当前GRPO因罕见重要性加权奖励（outlier importance-weighted rewards）导致的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的GRPO方法在大语言模型推理方面虽有提升，但对罕见奖励的敏感性导致政策更新不稳定。研究目标是开发一种方法提高政策优化的稳定性。

Method: GMPO通过优化token级奖励的几何平均值来替代传统的算术平均值，此方法对罕见值敏感性低，同时保持更稳定的重要性采样比区间。此外，提供了方法的理论证明与实验分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，相较于GRPO，GMPO-7B在多个数学基准测试中平均提升4.1%，在多模态推理基准上提升1.4%。

Conclusion: GMPO有效减少了重要性采样比的波动，提高了政策优化的稳定性，同时在数学和多模态推理任务中取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

TL;DR: 研究评估了多语言信息验证任务中小型专用模型与通用大型语言模型的性能，发现小型模型XLM-R显著优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对多语言虚假信息的快速传播，需要研究和开发能够处理细粒度真假评估的多语言自动化事实验证系统。

Method: 对五种最先进的语言模型在包含25种语言和7个真实性类别的X-Fact数据集上进行全面评估，包括小型模型（XLM-R和mT5）与大型模型（Llama 3.1、Qwen 2.5、Mistral Nemo）。

Result: 小型模型XLM-R在成绩上显著超过所有大型模型，达到了57.7%的宏F1分数，而最好的大型模型仅取得16.9%的宏F1，同时相比之前的最好结果提高了15.8%。

Conclusion: 小型专用模型在细粒度多语言事实验证中可能比通用大型模型更为有效，这对事实查证系统的实际部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，称为Text2VLM，用以评估多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）在面对提示注入攻击时的鲁棒性，发现现有开放源代码模型在加入视觉输入后变得更易受攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前针对视觉语言模型的评估数据集主要集中于纯文本提示，缺乏对视觉输入漏洞的充分评估，因此需要一种方法弥补这一评估上的空缺。

Method: 提出了Text2VLM，多阶段管道方法，将纯文本数据集转化为多模态格式，通过添加带有有害内容的图像生成多模态提示，从而用以检测VLMs的对抗攻击弹性。

Result: 实验揭示了开源VLMs在面对视觉输入时的脆弱点，比如提示注入攻击的易感性，同时强调其与封闭源前沿模型之间的显著性能差距。

Conclusion: Text2VLM为全面的安全性评估提供了可扩展工具，有助于开发更安全的VLMs，促进这些系统在多种现实应用中的安全部署。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过结构化剪枝和高效恢复训练相结合直接压缩现有多模态大语言模型的方法，并在低资源场景中展现显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽然表现出色，但其庞大的计算和存储需求为实际部署设置了障碍，现有减少参数的方法灵活性差且计算密集，因此亟需新的解决方案。

Method: 本文通过层级剪枝和宽度剪枝两种结构化剪枝方法，对MLLMs的语言模型主干部分进行压缩，并结合有监督微调和知识蒸馏进行恢复训练。还研究了仅使用少量数据进行恢复训练的可行性。

Result: 宽度剪枝在低资源场景下表现更佳，低压缩水平(<20%)时，仅微调多模态投影器就足够。从5%原始数据中恢复训练即可保留95%以上的原始性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过有效的结构化剪枝和恢复训练，可在计算资源和数据有限的情况下，压缩MLLMs的同时保持较高性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型(LLM)在多语言环境中的应用增加，迫切需要一种无需昂贵标注数据的高效信实性评估方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于合成多语言摘要数据和跨语言传递学习的自学评估框架，通过实验对比不同语言的微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，模型的语言能力与其在语言特定任务中的表现有一致关系，且框架相较现有标准方法取得了改进，包括超越了最先进的英语评估器。

Conclusion: 该框架无需大量标注数据便可在多语言环境中实现准确的信实性评估，为多语言语言模型的评价提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言处理中，文本嵌入因其广泛应用的高效性而备受关注。随着预训练语言模型的出现，GPTE成为生成丰富、可转移表示的重要工具。

Method: 通过综述，本文探讨了GPTE的基本架构及PLMs的基本和高级作用，包括多语言支持、多模态集成、代码理解及场景适应等，并评估了大规模对比学习优化策略。

Result: 文献全面回顾了GPTE的发展历程，强调了PLMs如何增强嵌入能力，并展望未来研究方向如排名集成、安全性、偏差缓解等。

Conclusion: 本文旨在帮助研究人员了解GPTE的现状及潜力，为未来探索提供指引。

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过大语言模型工具，研究团队开发了一种自动化的文本分析工具（PFD Toolkit），用于分析英国和威尔士死亡预防报告，显著提升了处理效率并提高了筛查的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析死亡预防报告方法依赖手动筛选和编码，效率低下且受主观因素影响，需要发展更高效、可靠的自动化工具。

Method: 应用一种开源的“文本到表格”大语言模型管道（PFD Toolkit），对2013年至2023年间的4,249份死亡预防报告进行自动处理，筛选自杀案例并进行主题分类分析，同时用临床医生的标注对工具的准确性进行验证。

Result: PFD Toolkit筛选出72例儿童自杀相关报告（比ONS人工识别的多近一倍）；模型筛选结果与临床医生标注结果的一致性较高，Cohen’s kappa达到0.82。总运行时间仅需8分16秒，远优于之前需耗时数月的人工处理。

Conclusion: 该研究证明，基于大语言模型的自动化分析工具可以可靠且高效地替代人工方法进行死亡预防报告的主题复核，可为公共卫生与安全领域提供及时和可扩展的见解，同时工具已开源便于后续研究。

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法中过于依赖语言提示、难以有效捕获用户间差异的问题，从而提升个性化输出效果。

Method: 采用区别感知的嵌入表征方法，通过用户自身和类似内容用户之间的对比生成软提示，并利用稀疏自编码器过滤和压缩嵌入信息，将有价值的信息注入大语言模型。

Result: 在个性化评论生成任务上表现优于现有方法，在多个评估指标上均取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: DEP通过在潜在空间中建模用户间差异，有效提升了大语言模型的个性化输出能力，为个性化任务开启了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

Motivation: 探讨为什么多样性在NLP中越来越受关注，以及在该领域对多样性的研究缺乏系统性的原因。

Method: 通过回顾过去6年ACL文集中标题包含‘多样性’或‘多样化’的论文，提出将多样性衡量统一于生态学和经济学的框架中，并从多样性的种类、平衡性和差异性三个维度进行分析。

Result: 研究发现了描述多样性的一系列设置，很多情况下术语使用不一致。同时，通过统一分类方法，总结了多样性概念在NLP领域的趋势。

Conclusion: 该研究为NLP中的多样性研究提供了更系统的理论框架，有助于更好地理解多样性并促进不同方法之间的可比性。

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

Result: 14B参数的部分模型（Phi-4-14B、Qwen-2.5-14B、DeepSeek-R1-14B）表现良好，而更大的Llama-3.3-70B获得更高性能但计算成本较高；翻译至英语后性能下降，强调本地化语言处理的需求。

Conclusion: 论文表明，在低资源环境下，结合提议的开源框架，开源大语言模型可提供有效、可扩展且保护隐私的临床信息抽取解决方案。

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有的多示例提示是否是传递任务信息的最佳方式，并尝试改进以减少推理消耗与提升性能。

Method: 通过少样本ICL提示构建任务嵌入；在推理阶段以预优化的“软头选择参数”将任务嵌入与注意力头激活进行软混合，替代传统提示方法。

Result: 在57个任务和12个大语言模型上进行评估，比10-shot ICL性能提升10.1%-13.9%；同时显著降低了内存占用与计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法以软注入取代提示空间的任务传递方式，既提升了任务性能，又揭示了注意力头的任务相关角色，为减少提示长度和优化任务表现提供了新范式。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Result: 改进的Phi-4模型在二元分类F1分数上提升了8%，总体检测性能提高30%。尽管Phi-4-mini模型参数量仅为4亿，其性能依旧接近OpenAI-o3，二元检测仅下降2%，总体检测仅下降0.1%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展的方法来提高大语言模型在金融领域及其他领域生成文本的真实性和可信度，同时发布了代码和数据以供社会使用。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/pegasi-ai/fine-grained-editting.

Motivation: 研究发现指令微调减少了LLMs在创意任务中的输出多样性，这对许多任务有不良影响。为了深入理解这一问题并尝试改进机制，展开了研究。

Method: 分析了不同开源模型在叙述生成任务中的多样性缺失问题，重点研究了OLMo与OLMo 2模型的每个微调阶段如何影响输出多样性，并提出了新解码策略——共形解码。

Result: 发现DPO对多样性的影响最显著，共形解码可以提高多样性，同时维持或改善生成质量。

Conclusion: 指令微调会显著降低输出多样性，但通过共形解码可以有效缓解这一问题，未来可用于改进创意任务中模型表现。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Motivation: 研究微调过程中的模型记忆特性，特别是医疗领域的数据隐私问题。

Method: 采用成员推断攻击检测数据记忆，及通过提示前缀评估逐字生成，分析变压器权重矩阵、困惑度与记忆的关系及LoRA微调中秩的影响。

Result: 价值和输出矩阵对记忆影响显著；低困惑度相关记忆增强；LoRA微调中更高秩增加记忆，但收益递减。

Conclusion: 提出了性能与隐私的权衡策略，提供了处理数据隐私问题的模型微调新见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类评估资源稀缺且昂贵，文中的方法旨在高效模拟真实人类的多维度评价。

Method: 提出MAJ-EVAL框架，该框架通过从相关文本中自动构建评估人格，使用多代理参与小组辩论生成多维度反馈。

Result: 实验表明，在教育和医疗领域，MAJ-EVAL生成的评估结果比传统方法和现有LLM评价方法更接近人类专家的判断。

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL能有效生成更贴近人类专业评估的多维度评价结果，具有较大应用价值。

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在任务导向对话系统中处理长条件工作流、外部工具调用和用户特定信息时的不足。

Method: 提出了一个无需训练的模块化框架WARPP，结合动态裁剪条件分支和并行化架构，使用专用“个性化代理”和领域特定代理实时定制执行路径。

Result: WARPP在包括银行、航班和医疗健康的三领域五个不同复杂度用户意图上进行评估，显示相较非个性化方法和ReAct基线，参数符合度、工具准确性提升明显，且节省了平均token使用。

Conclusion: WARPP框架在无需额外训练的情况下，通过实时并行个性化处理显著提升了复杂任务导向对话系统的工作流执行效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论对理性、完整信息和共同知识的假设在现实多智能体系统中难以满足，因此需要模型扩展以解决主观信念和认知约束问题。

Method: 提出基于超博弈理论的分类框架与评估标准，并对不同领域44个研究案例进行分析，包括网络安全、机器人和社交模拟等。

Result: 发现层级模型和基于图的模型在欺骗推理中较为常见，广泛的理论框架在实际应用中被简化，但存在对HNF模型和正式语言的不足应用。

Conclusion: 通过趋势和挑战分析，为动态多智能体环境中超博弈理论的应用提供了新的研究方向和建议。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: DeltaLLM提出了一个无需训练的框架，通过利用注意力模式中的时序稀疏性，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效的LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前动态注意力剪枝研究主要针对具有强大并行计算能力的硬件（如GPU和TPU），并不适用于边缘设备。

Method: 通过精确和内存感知的增量矩阵构建策略引入时序稀疏性，并结合上下文感知混合注意机制，将局部上下文窗口中的全注意力与外部的增量近似结合以提高精度。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上实现了高达60%和57%的注意力稀疏性，同时保持或改善了精度和F1得分。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM不需要微调，能无缝集成到现有推理管道，是边缘设备高效部署的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the

Result: 发现当前的LLMs难以满足科学探究的高可靠性需求，同时确认其可能面临退化路径的高风险。

Conclusion: LLMs未来的发展需要更加注重分析问题的结构特性，以及提升模型的洞察力和理解力以规避退化风险。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

Motivation: 探索内在动机技术如何影响强化学习代理在稀疏奖励环境中的表现，以及其是否会引起奖励游戏行为。

Method: 通过将三种内在动机技术与广义奖励匹配（GRM）方法进行比较，并在MiniGrid游戏环境中进行实证评估。

Result: 结果显示，内在动机可改善初始探索奖励，但会改变代理的行为模式，而GRM在某些情况下能够缓解奖励游戏问题。

Conclusion: 内在动机方法对行为变化有显著影响，但广义奖励匹配可在一定程度上减轻潜在的负面效应。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱缺乏针对特定患者的重要上下文信息，而电子健康记录提供了个性化数据，将两者结合可以提升精准医疗预测的能力。

Method: 采用先进的实体链接技术，将通用知识图谱中的相关知识与电子健康记录中的患者信息连接起来。然后利用超图模型和超图Transformer，根据下游任务联合学习KG与患者的上下文化表征。

Conclusion: HypKG通过融合外部上下文，不仅提升了医疗预测表现，还改善了知识图谱实体及关系的表征质量，增加了其现实应用价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

Conclusion: 通过结合本体语义框架与统计方法，提出了一种更精确描述动态现象的预测方法，并证明其在具体场景下的可行性及效益。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

Motivation: 现有LLM在ASP能力评估上存在局限性，缺乏专门设计的基准测试来全面测试ASP解决能力。

Method: 提出并创建了ASPBench，包含专为ASP设计的三个任务：ASP蕴含验证、答案集验证与答案集计算，综合测试LLM在ASP领域的表现。

Result: 14种LLM在简单的ASP蕴含和答案集验证任务上表现相对较好，但在核心的答案集计算任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在ASP求解核心任务上存在局限性，需开发整合符号推理的新方法。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DiCap的扩散式反事实提示学习框架，旨在提升提示学习的因果不变性和跨类别泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法因理论基础不足，难以实现因果不变的提示学习，从而无法有效捕获稳健特征以适应跨类别泛化需求。

Method: DiCap模型通过扩散过程迭代采样因果模型的边缘和条件分布的梯度，生成满足最小充分性标准的反事实，同时结合对比学习框架，精确提取与因果特征对齐的提示。

Result: 实验结果表明，在图像分类、图文检索和视觉问答等任务中，特别是在未见类别上，DiCap模型表现卓越。

Conclusion: DiCap不仅从理论上保证了反事实结果的可辨识性，并对估计误差设定了严格限制，显示了其强大的跨任务和跨类别泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了如何从人与技术的关系角度分析人工智能（AI），将人类认知作为核心关注点，提出了一种新的分类方式，用于分析技术对人类认知劳动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨以人为中心的AI如何实质性地影响人类认知及其在AI系统开发中的意义，并揭示技术对人类认知劳动的不同影响。

Method: 通过提出新定义和分析方法，将技术对人类认知劳动的影响分为替代（中性）、提升（有益）和取代（有害）三种类型，同时通过对比技术与认知的例子加以论证。

Result: AI无论如何都会对人类认知产生影响，而忽略认知在AI背景下的作用会阻碍批判性思维、扭曲认知科学，并降低以人为本的AI设计能力。

Conclusion: 为了摆脱对AI的迷信，应认真关注人机关系中涉及的认知过程，重视人类在技术开发中的中心地位。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了使用大语言模型（LLMs）从MRI/CT报告中自动提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征，并基于指南分配风险类别的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从放射学报告中手动提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征的过程非常耗时，限制了大规模研究的开展，而实现自动化将有助于推动PCL研究发展。

Method: 利用5,134名患者的6,000份腹部MRI/CT报告（2005-2024年）构建训练数据集，通过GPT-4o和链式思维（CoT）方法生成标注，使用QLoRA对两个开源LLM进行微调，并根据2017年ACR白皮书的指南将特征映射到风险类别中，最后对模型输出进行多方面评估。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在特征提取准确性（97%）及风险分类F1分数（LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94）上与GPT-4o接近，且放射科医师与模型的一致性（Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893左右）无显著统计差异。

Conclusion: 经过链式思维监督微调的开源LLMs能够实现精准、可解释和高效的胰腺囊性病变表型研究，为大规模研究提供支持，其性能可媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数字孪生信道（DTC）的在线优化框架，通过环境感知预测信道状态信息（CSI），并利用博弈理论算法进行高效资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前6G网络中的新型应用需要低时延、高可靠的资源分配，而传统基于统计建模的方法存在对动态环境适应性不足的问题。

Method: 通过数字孪生信道（DTC）预测信道状态信息（CSI），然后利用轻量级博弈理论算法进行资源分配优化。

Result: 在模拟工业车间中，该方法相比基于导频的理想CSI方案可提高吞吐量达11.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了其在未来6G网络中实现可扩展、低开销及环境感知型通信的有效性。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Result: 提出了一个概念性框架，展示了如何通过用户对话和偏好整合建立透明可追溯的AI系统。

Conclusion: 未来的AI系统应提升透明度与可解释性，使用户理解AI的决策过程，从而增强AI在决策中的可信度。

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

Method: 在传统的稳定室友问题模型基础上，考虑代理人间的好友网络，设计了一种生成个性化匹配解决方案的方法，并通过实例和实证评估展示其鲁棒性及有效性。

Result: 提出了一种能综合代理人偏好及好友网络的个性化匹配解决方案，并通过实验证明其实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究在解决稳定室友问题无解的情况下，提出了一种考虑现实需求的个性化匹配方法，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

TL;DR: PITA框架通过在推理时直接引入用户偏好反馈，无需额外的奖励模型，实现了与用户偏好对齐的文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依赖预训练奖励模型的推理对齐方法存在对不稳定人类反馈的依赖，亟需一种简化的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种在推理阶段整合用户偏好的引导策略PITA，通过随机搜索和迭代优化修正LLM的token概率分布，而无需进行额外微调。

Result: PITA在数学推理和情感分类等任务中的表现证明了其能够有效地对齐LLM生成结果与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA不仅避免了对预训练奖励模型的依赖，还降低了计算成本，开辟了推理对齐的新方向。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多智能体强化学习方法在透明性和可解释性方面存在不足，特别是现有模型中合作机制往往因网络的黑箱特性而不够明确。

Method: 通过引入一种基于概念瓶颈模型的可解释价值分解框架，提出CMQ方法，将个体动作价值与全局状态嵌入相结合，更好地表示合作概念。

Result: CMQ在StarCraft II micromanagement挑战和基于等级的觅食任务中性能优于现有方法，并能有效捕获合作模式，支持测试时的概念干预以检测潜在偏差。

Conclusion: CMQ在实现高性能的同时提高了对合作概念的表达能力，推动了多智能体系统的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Conclusion: 研究为从经验启发向理论化方向推进政策稳定性分析，并提供了设计更安全、可信AI系统的洞见。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Conclusion: HFrame显著改进了子图同态问题的解决效率和效果，为图神经网络的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical

We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics
from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score:
35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine
that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances
decision making in complex R&D environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs因其在安全对齐中的关键作用面临新的挑战，高维特性虽然带来成功，但也可能引发新的问题。

Result: 实验结果显示降维可以保留对齐所需的信息，同时显著减少通过表示工程进行越狱的可能性。

Conclusion: 高维表示既是LLMs的一大优势，也可能成为其在安全对齐中的隐患；降维是应对这一问题的有效手段。

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对视觉上下文的充分利用，如微细道路线索、事故后果或意外障碍，限制了在复杂驾驶环境中的决策能力。

Method: 提出了VLMPlanner框架，其中视觉语言模型处理多视角图像以获取丰富的视觉信息，并通过上下文自适应推断机制（CAI-Gate）根据场景复杂度动态调整推断频率，指导实时规划器生成安全轨迹。

Conclusion: VLMPlanner利用视觉语言模型结合实时规划器，提升了自动驾驶中在复杂情境下的规划能力，同时优化了计算效率。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在城市环境下，出行资源的供需平衡对于共享单车、电动滑板车和网约车等资源的合理分配至关重要。现有多智能体强化学习方法存在动态参数共享和内存效率低的问题，需要一种新的方法解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出HAG-PS方法，包括分层的全局与局部信息整合、自适应的智能体分组和基于可学习ID嵌入的智能体专用化策略。实现动态资源分配和高效参数共享。

Result: 基于纽约共享单车数据（一百二十万多次出行）进行了实验，HAG-PS在改进单车可用性等方面展示了优于其他基线方法的表现。

Conclusion: HAG-PS通过动态自适应分组和内存高效的参数共享，显著提升了城市级别出行资源分配的表现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在机器人学和AI自主系统中的空间推理能力，以评估其在现实世界中可靠部署的潜力，特别是在传感器信息受限情况下。

Method: 提出MazeEval基准，通过坐标反馈和距离信息测试大语言模型在不同大小迷宫导航任务下的纯空间推理，无视觉输入。对8种最先进LLM在多语言场景下的表现进行对比评估。

Result: OpenAI的O3在30×30迷宫中表现完美，而其他模型在超过9×9迷宫时完全失败，其中失败主要归因于过度循环行为。跨语言表现显示，冰岛语环境下模型的迷宫解决能力大幅下降。

Conclusion: 语言模式主导LLM的空间推理，而非语言无关机制。表明LLM在全球部署中受限于训练数据，呼吁设计架构创新以提高不同语言情境下的导航可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

Conclusion: STARN-GAT有效弥合了先进图神经网络技术与道路安全分析实际应用之间的差距，能够识别高风险案例，并具有较强的解释性，适合部署于实时交通管理系统。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Motivation: 探讨当前LLM驱动的AI代理在复杂任务执行中的安全性和对部署策略的遵循能力，尤其是在攻击情况下。

Method: 通过对22个AI代理在44个现实场景中的性能进行测试，组织了最大规模的公开红队竞赛，并生成ART基准框架用于测试AI系统的安全性和健壮性。

Result: 发现参与测试的AI代理中，几乎都在10-100次查询内发生策略违规，证明了当前模型对攻击的脆弱性；同时，发现模型规模、能力和推理计算量与安全性之间的关联较低。

Conclusion: 当前AI代理在面对恶意攻击时存在重大脆弱性，需通过进一步的安全评估和防御体系建设来提升其部署的安全性。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于认知科学的AI架构设计可以显著提升启发式生成的能力，同时提供更强的解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

Motivation: 现有的知识图谱嵌入方法难以应对知识的遗忘需求，包括删除过时或错误信息，同时保留其余知识的完整性。

Method: GraphDPO基于直接偏好优化(DPO)，通过优化偏好重新构造替换忘记三元组，减少其依赖性；同时，通过越边界采样策略以及边界回忆机制，改善知识遗忘与保留之间的平衡。

Result: 在四个主流知识图谱的八个数据集上测试，GraphDPO在MRR_Avg和MRR_F1指标上分别超越最新基线方法最大10.1%和14.0%。

Conclusion: GraphDPO在保证知识遗忘完整性的同时，成功保留了边界知识，相比其他方法表现更优。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

Conclusion: 提出的D-MAPF方法展示了其在动态环境中的适应性，但建议在未来进一步优化性能与质量。

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within
a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles.
Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the
environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of
real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

*Filip Cano,Thomas A. Henzinger,Konstantin Kueffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了AI系统公平性作为运行时动态属性，而非传统静态属性，提出了一个框架来分析其在演变环境下的公平性，并探讨了监控和执行的策略与现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统中公平性在动态操作中的表现，以解决目前静态研究无法适应实际场景的问题。

Method: 基于动态硬币掷投模型，提出并分析监控和执行公平性的策略，并在不同环境动态、预测范围及信心阈值下总结通用结论。

Result: 提供通用监控和执行策略；回顾了已有解决方案在特定动态环境和静态已知动态中的应用。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在动态环境中理解与分析AI公平性的重要性，推动了运行时公平性评估与优化的研究方向。

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

*Andrés Holgado-Sánchez,Holger Billhardt,Sascha Ossowski,Sara Degli-Esposti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于启发式深度聚类的方法，用于学习社会的价值系统及其多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI系统与人类价值观和利益相关者的价值偏好（价值系统）对齐，以实现伦理AI。

Method: 通过观察代理行为中的定性价值偏好，利用启发式深度聚类来学习社会共享的价值基础以及多样的社会价值系统。

Result: 在一个关于旅行决策的真实数据用例中进行了方法评估，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 价值学习不仅停留于个体层面的价值系统，还需要通过基于群体的多样性建模来捕捉社会整体的价值系统复杂性，以推进价值感知AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过AI技术在健康信息语音呼叫中提升受益者参与度及健康行为改变的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前自动语音健康信息传播面临受益者流失及参与度低的问题，需探索AI技术能否提升参与并改善健康行为。

Method: 通过应用restless bandit模型，针对性识别需要干预的受益者，分析AI干预是否同时能改进健康行为。

Result: AI干预不仅提高了健康信息倾听率，还显著改善了受益者的健康行为，如孕期和产后补充营养等习惯。

Conclusion: AI技术在提升健康信息传播参与度的同时，也显著提升了母婴健康相关行为，展示了其在公共健康领域的潜力。

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT显著提升模型推理能力，其核心机制尚未弄清，因此研究其信息流动和操作原理。

Method: 通过逆向跟踪信息流分析CoT的解码、投影和激活过程，并进行定量分析。

Result: 发现CoT作为解码空间的裁剪器，利用答案模板指导生成，并调节神经元活跃度（开放域任务降低，闭合域任务提高）。

Conclusion: 提出了新的机制解释框架及优化CoT设计以提升提示效率和鲁棒性的关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

TL;DR: 本文提出evalSmarT，一个利用大语言模型(LLMs)作为评估工具的框架，用于评估智能合约评论生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能合约评论生成的重要性提高，传统评估方法如BLEU和ROUGE无法捕捉领域特定的细微差别，而人工评估又昂贵且难以扩展，亟需一种新方法解决此问题。

Method: 开发了evalSmarT框架，该框架可以通过结合约40个LLMs和10种提示策略，支持超过400种评估配置，用于评估智能合约评论生成工具并选择最优结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，提示设计对与人工判断的一致性产生显著影响，基于LLM的评估提供了一种可扩展且语义上丰富的替代方法。

Conclusion: evalSmarT框架证明了利用大语言模型进行评估的潜力，不仅解决了传统评估方法的不足，还显著降低了成本并提高了效率。

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

TL;DR: MMGraphRAG通过引入场景图和多模态知识图，改进了传统的检索增强生成方法，展现了优越的任务适应性和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法难以处理多模态信息，且缺乏对知识结构和模态间逻辑链的充分建模。

Method: 利用场景图提炼视觉内容，结合文本知识构造多模态知识图谱，并通过谱聚类实现跨模态实体关联，沿推理路径检索上下文以指导生成过程。

Result: 在DocBench和MMLongBench数据集上表现出最先进的性能，同时展现出强大的领域适应性和清晰的推理路径。

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG有效解决了传统方法的多模态信息缺失及推理能力有限的问题，为多模态检索生成提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的采样算法POMCGS用于离线解决大规模POMDPs问题，能够处理连续POMDPs并产生有竞争力的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）的在线算法虽然有效，但在时间或能量受限应用场景中预计算离线策略更理想。然而，已有离线算法无法扩展到大规模POMDPs。

Method: 作者提出了一种名为POMCGS（部分可观测蒙特卡洛图搜索）的新离线算法，它通过动态构建策略图而非传统的搜索树实现计算简化，同时结合动作渐进扩展和观测聚类方法，支持处理连续POMDPs。

Result: 实验表明，POMCGS能够生成适用于之前离线算法无法处理的复杂POMDPs的策略，这些策略与在线算法相比性能具有竞争力。

Conclusion: POMCGS是一种有效的离线解决大规模和连续POMDPs问题的算法，为相关应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了探讨语言模型的推理局限性及其与神经网络架构深度的关系，进而理解模型常见问题如幻觉和重复现象的根本原因。

Method: 视神经网络为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，分析其层次与逻辑推理深度的关系，证明深度限制模型逻辑扩展能力。

Result: 模型深度对逻辑推理能力形成严格上限，限制复杂谓词表示，解释幻觉与规划能力等局限现象，并为逻辑近似的形成机制提供说明。

Conclusion: 该框架既揭示了现有语言模型的局限性，也为未来架构改进与可解释性研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

Motivation: 在当前的人工智能安全研究中，确保系统在不影响人类利益的情况下可纠正和可控是一个关键问题。本研究旨在开发一个实用框架，解决多步骤、部分观察环境中的纠正性问题。

Method: 框架通过引入五个独立的效用头，包括服从、开关访问保留、可靠性、低影响行为以及有界任务奖励，并通过严格的权重差异将其结合。框架使用证明方法分析和确保安全性。

Result: 通过理论证明在部分观察的关停游戏中实现单回合纠正性，并扩展到多步场景，能够保证在人类利益受益的前提下，降低安全性违背的风险。同时，在开放式环境中，为一些特定问题定义了可以在多项式时间内验证的有限范围安全性保证。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种可实现的纠正性框架，它通过结构化和可验证方法明确了实现安全的步骤，并提供对当前辅助技术和未来自主系统的实施指导。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在不同情境下容易发生幻觉行为，现有评估方法分散且缺乏统一的测试基准。本文为解决这一问题而提出了MIRAGE-Bench。

Method: 通过系统审计现有代理基准和使用快照策略产生测试案例，对不同任务中的决策点进行隔离分析，并采用精细的基于LLM作为评估者的评估框架，对幻觉行为进行高保真评估。

Result: MIRAGE-Bench揭示了LLM代理失败的模式，并为实现交互式环境中幻觉的缓解奠定了理论基础。

Conclusion: 本文为评估和缓解LLM代理幻觉提供了一个综合性基准和框架，推动了相关领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功优化了交互式配置求解的性能，解决了性能挑战，并为用户提供了友好的交互体验，具有实际工业应用的潜力。

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

Motivation: 当前基因表达分析面临半结构化数据复杂性及自动化解决方案局限性的问题，亟需融合可靠性与灵活性的创新方法。

Method: 提出GenoMAS，一个由六个专用LLM代理协作完成的系统，整合结构化工作流与自主智能代理的优势，通过引导规划框架实施任务分解和决策控制。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准中，GenoMAS在数据预处理和基因识别任务上分别提升10.61%和16.85%，相关结果与文献中的生物学假设一致。

Conclusion: GenoMAS有效解决了基因组数据复杂性处理挑战，显著提升分析精确度，并为基因表型关联研究提供了可验证的生物学依据，为领域发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Result: 整理了自我进化代理的评估指标和基准，剖析其在编程、教育、医疗领域的应用，以及当前的挑战与研究方向。

Conclusion: 为理解和设计自我进化代理提供结构化框架，奠定实现开发超人工智能（ASI）的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本论文提出了NACHOS框架，用于自动设计早退出神经网络（EENNs），通过神经架构搜索（NAS）方法优化在准确性和计算成本（MAC操作数）方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EENNs设计复杂，需要手动完成多个参数的优化（如阈值设定、分类器放置），本研究旨在开发一种自动化的设计策略，解决这些问题并优化EENN性能。

Method: 提出了NACHOS，这是一个基于NAS的框架，同时设计EENN的主干网络和早退出分类器（EECs）。该框架在满足准确性和计算成本限制条件下，生成一组符合要求的帕累托最优解。引入了两个新正则化项来优化辅助分类器。

Result: 使用NACHOS设计的模型在准确性和效率上与当前最先进的EENNs性能相当，且具备更优化的设计有效性。

Conclusion: NACHOS框架提供了一种硬件约束条件下的EENN设计方案，有效平衡准确性与计算成本，证明了方法的先进性和实用性。

Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN)
with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate
points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved.
This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex
and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including
the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the
EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive
NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully
automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone
and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural
Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks
(NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying
constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC)
operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

Motivation: 股票市场高度波动，使得制定能够持续盈利的交易决策极具挑战性，当前的方法难以在复杂波动环境中取得优异表现。

Method: 提出四种新损失函数，以潜在盈亏为核心目标，结合人工神经网络训练交易策略，并用时间序列模型（如Crossformer）在股票市场进行验证。

Result: 使用2021-2023年测试数据，基于最佳损失函数和Crossformer模型的交易策略分别获得了51.42%、51.04%和48.62%的回报率，表现优于主流强化学习方法（例如PPO和DDPG）及基础买入持有策略。

Conclusion: 通过引入新损失函数驱动交易策略，可以在波动性强的股票市场环境中稳定地实现较高投资回报。

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有AI方法难以有效捕捉用户移动引起的复杂时空模式，从而限制了5G及更高网络的智能管理效率。

Method: 设计了一个结合了轻量化Scalar LSTM进行时间建模和三层Conv3D模块进行空间特征提取的模型，并通过融合层整合两方面特征，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在小波域实现高效神经网络，避免传统架构中高复杂度的计算，并验证其在自然语言处理和视觉任务中的适用性。

Method: 使用可学习的非线性变换（如软阈值和增益-相位调制）直接作用于小波系数，同时实现可微分的小波基选择、避免使用空间卷积或注意力机制，并采用线性时间的小波变换。

Result: 在3D去噪及GLUE基准测试（如SST-2情感分类）中实现与4层Transformer基线（90.1%）接近的89.3%准确率，同时参数减少72%，峰值内存消耗减少58%，且具备更快的早期收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了小波域学习在视觉和语言任务中是可行且高效的，为构建无需过度参数化架构的模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

Motivation: 针对结构健康监测领域中训练数据昂贵且获取困难、特别是标注数据不足的问题，提出利用人口级别的结构数据，通过迁移学习处理不同结构间分布差异的问题。

Method: 采用模态保证准则（MAC）作为度量工具，以量化健康结构模态间的对应关系，并选择在受损情况下条件分布一致的特征进行迁移学习；方法通过数值和实验案例进行验证。

Conclusion: 使用MAC进行特征和域的选择能有效提升迁移学习在结构健康监测中的表现，尤其针对无监督条件的应用场景。

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

Conclusion: 通过PINN方法可以有效解决同时优化网络参数和建模参数的复杂问题。

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

Abstract: Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons
(MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research
advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents promising

remains challenging due to the narrow scope of existing benchmarks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMCircuitEval, the first multimodal benchmark

accuracy and relevance. Our benchmark uniquely categorizes questions by design
stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning,
computation), and difficulty level, enabling detailed analysis of model

performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了通过利用人工智能和气象数据开发维护压力指数（MPI），以辅助绿色氢气基础设施的风险预测和运维决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全球对绿色氢气投资增长的背景下，现缺乏大型氢气设施的历史运行和维护数据，特别是在严酷的沙漠环境下。这种数据空缺阻碍了基础设施规划和拍卖决策中的准确风险评估。

Method: 提出一种基于人工智能的决策支持系统，利用公开的气象数据开发预测性维护压力指数（MPI），以预测氢能基础设施的风险水平和未来维护需求。

Conclusion: 作者提出的人工智能决策支持工具利用气象数据为绿色氢能项目提供可靠的风险预测，在缺乏历史数据的情况下具有显著的实用价值。

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的ML方法面临外部验证不足、不确定性量化缺乏以及数据泄露问题，亟需更可靠的解决方案用于ICU血压预测。

Method: 提出了系统性数据泄露预防、不确定性量化（通过分位数回归）以及基于MIMIC-III和eICU数据库的外部验证，采用集成框架结合74个特征进行预测。

Result: 内部验证达到了临床可接受表现（SBP: R^2=0.86, RMSE=6.03; DBP: R^2=0.49, RMSE=7.13）。但外部验证表现下降30%，低血压患者预测有局限。不确定性量化表明短区间预测用于日常监控，宽区间用于人工核查。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨机构AI辅助血压监控提供了现实部署的期望，与ICU中的实际限制相适应，且源代码已公开。

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedDPG的动态提示生成模型，可生成基于输入内容的上下文相关提示，在联邦学习环境中提高灵活性和隐私保障性，同时减少计算时间和参数传输量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型（PLMs）虽然性能优秀，但传统的微调方法计算开销高；提示微调（Prompt-tuning）出现后虽降低了开销，但提示参数固定，降低了模型灵活性。同时，联邦学习虽然提升了数据隐私保护，但客户通信和计算限制问题仍需解决。

Method: 提出一种联邦动态提示生成器(FedDPG)，结合动态提示生成网络，根据输入生成上下文相关提示，同时保持PLMs参数固定，并实现联邦学习环境下的数据隐私保护。

Result: 实验表明，FedDPG在三个NLP基准数据集上的全局模型性能优于最先进的参数高效微调方法，并显著减少计算时间和通过FL网络传输的参数数量。

Conclusion: FedDPG不仅提升了模型在联邦学习环境下的性能，还通过动态提示生成实现了灵活性与效率的结合，同时大幅降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了人工智能主导的新范式，利用图神经网络和自然语言模型推动无定形材料的智能设计。

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 通过改进现有TD学习方法的步骤优化和噪声处理能力，解决模型在非平稳分布下的学习困难。

Method: 将SwiftTD的核心思想与True Online Sarsa(λ)相结合，提出了Swift-Sarsa，同时构建了新的评估基准——操作性条件反射基准。

Result: Swift-Sarsa在操作性条件反射基准中表现出色，无需预先了解问题结构即可区分噪声和相关信号并分配学习权重。

Conclusion: Swift-Sarsa展示了在存在大量噪声特征时高效学习的重要潜力，为探索大规模特征的表示学习方法提供了思路。

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

Motivation: 当前AF的导管消融疗法对于持续性AF效果不佳，主要是因为涉及到肺静脉以外的非肺静脉驱动因子，亟需一种高效自动化分析EGM的方法。

Method: 研究采用卷积自编码器进行无监督学习，从单极和双极心腔内心电图中提取潜在表示，辅助AF驱动因子的检测。

Result: 自编码器在低重建损失的情况下成功提取了保留形态特征的表示，可区分旋转和焦点活动（AUC 0.73-0.76）并高度有效地识别心房EGM纠缠（AUC 0.93）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实时运行，并集成到临床电解剖映射系统中，有助于在消融过程中识别致心律失常区域，展示了无监督学习在揭示心内信号生理学特征中的潜力。

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Motivation: 当前的机器学习虽然流行，但计算强度高且能耗巨大，因此需要寻找替代的物理实现方案，以更高效地完成学习任务。

Method: 引入了一个称为BEASTAL的训练方案，该方案通过控制边界参数（如输入和输出），利用局部物理规则实现自动学习，无需大规模内存或复杂的内部架构。

Result: 验证了BEASTAL在回归和分类任务中的应用效果，尤其在局部演化规则为非线性时能实现最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有效的物理学习方案，能够通过局部规则进行线性任务的自动学习，同时在功耗方面表现出色。

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Motivation: 解决分布重心计算中关于数据隐私、方法复杂性及可伸缩性的不足。

Method: 引入联邦双重分解算法，通过不直接访问局部数据，仅使用高层次聚合信息来进行计算。同时避免多次解决运输问题并消除了矩阵-向量操作。

Conclusion: 算法具有低迭代复杂度，高扩展性，适用性强，为分布重心计算提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it
to the state-of-the-art methods on several examples of mixture models.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络在一些任务上远远优于核方法，这与神经网络学习和适应特征的能力相关。需要新的理论框架来更好地理解这一现象。

Method: 引入了特征质量概念来测量神经网络的特征学习效果，并通过经验研究分析现有理论的局限性。

Result: 发现现有特征学习理论主要关注特征学习的强度，而非特征本身的质量，从而揭示了其不足之处。

Conclusion: 当前的特征学习理论缺乏评估特征质量的能力，因此需要进一步发展以支持对神经网络泛化能力的理解。

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Motivation: 由于CAN协议缺乏内在安全机制，易受网络攻击，亟需有效的入侵检测方法。

Method: 将CAN通信流量转化为图，用滑动窗口捕捉时序和关系模式；通过多层GAT教师模型进行知识提炼，训练学生模型，使其在仅有教师模型6.32%大小的情况下拥有高准确率。

Result: 在Car-Hacking和Car-Survival数据集上，学生模型分别达到99.97%和99.31%的准确率，但在can-train-and-test数据集上，由于类别不平衡问题导致性能下降。

Conclusion: KD-GAT在提高CAN入侵检测的准确性和效率方面表现卓越，但面对数据类别不平衡的挑战仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

Conclusion: 商业语义和行业分类信息通过嵌入学习提供了纯粹基于地理模型无法解释的重要信号，从而大幅提升了预测场所间共同访问模式的准确性与排名质量。

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过不相交生成模型生成横截面合成数据集的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过分离模型提高数据隐私性，同时保持数据的实用价值。

Method: 将数据集划分为不相交的子集，并对每个子集采用独立的生成模型，最终通过联合操作合成整体数据。

Result: 在表格数据案例中展示了成功性和一些设计选择的可行性。

Conclusion: 分离生成模型能够显著提高隐私性，同时仅需付出较低的实用性成本，某些模型类型在该框架下表现出更高效与可行性，还支持混合模型合成的可能性。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的语义压缩检索范式，优先考虑覆盖范围和多样性，通过图增强的向量检索进行多跳和上下文感知的搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的近邻搜索方法缺乏语义多样性和上下文丰富性，难以满足一些对语义覆盖多样性有更高需求的应用。

Method: 利用子模优化和信息几何的原理，引入语义压缩检索，结合图增强如kNN生成多跳的上下文搜索，同时对高维数据集中性进行理论分析。

Result: 语义压缩检索能够比传统的最近邻搜索提供更好语义覆盖，通过图结构提升语义表达范围。

Conclusion: 基于语义压缩的新范式，在语义覆盖、多样性查询及结构化语义检索方面提供了更广泛的理论基础和实践支持。

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DisasterMobLLM框架，专注于灾难场景下的人类移动预测，并显著提升了预测准确性和F1得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于城市化和气候变化，自然灾害的脆弱性增加。而现有的人类移动预测模型无法适应灾难场景下的人类移动模式变化，因此需要开发新的预测框架。

Method: 提出DisasterMobLLM框架，综合利用LLMs预测移动意图，通过RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor预测意图，LLM-based Intention Refiner优化意图，最终靠Intention-Modulated Location Predictor将意图映射到具体位置。

Result: 实验证明，DisasterMobLLM相比现有基线方法，在准确率和F1得分上分别提升了32.8%和35.0%。

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM有效提供了在灾难场景下更高效的人类移动预测能力，表现优于现有模型，并有助于灾害预警和资源分配。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DisasterMobLLM.

Method: 引入了一个经过筛选的温度稳定性数据集，并开发了Segment Transformer这一深度学习模型，使用段级别表示对序列不同部分的热性行为贡献差异进行建模。

Result: 模型在预测性能上达到24.03的RMSE、18.09的MAE以及0.33的皮尔逊和斯皮尔曼相关性。此外，将该模型应用于cutinase酶的工程设计，通过17次突变显著提高热处理后的相对活性至1.64倍，且未影响催化功能。

Conclusion: Segment Transformer模型成功展示了将深度学习用于酶热稳定性建模与改造的前景，提供了提升生物分子热性能的新工具。

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Conclusion: 新方法为工程师提供了一种高效便捷的工具，能简化设计表达的迭代过程并提升工作效率。

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

Abstract: Bladder cancer claims one life every 3 minutes worldwide. Most patients are
diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), yet up to 70% recur
after treatment, triggering a relentless cycle of surgeries, monitoring, and
risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and
unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour
count, surgeon experience, and hospital stay - offering accuracy and full
transparency. This makes TM a powerful, trustworthy decision-support tool ready
for real-world adoption.

Motivation: 鉴于联邦学习在医疗影像中的广泛应用，其对本地因素的敏感性可能限制其在实际环境中的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过在结肠病理学及血细胞分类任务上的联邦学习方法基准测试，分析不同优化器、学习率及本地训练轮次的影响。

Result: 发现本地优化器和学习率的选择比具体的联邦学习方法对性能影响更大，增加本地训练轮次对收敛性能的影响取决于所选FL方法。

Conclusion: 适当的设备特定配置比算法复杂性更重要，这对于实现高效的联邦学习是关键。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在持续学习任务中因灾难性遗忘导致零样本能力下降，这需要一个同时保护已有知识对齐的学习方法。

Method: 提出了GNSP方法，通过将任务特定梯度投射到之前知识的零空间来防止干扰，并结合知识蒸馏与模态对齐保持多模态嵌入空间的稳定。

Result: 在MTIL基准的11个任务中达成了State of the Art（SOTA），并成功维持了CLIP的模态间差异和跨模态检索性能。

Conclusion: 方法有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，维持了多模态嵌入空间的稳定性，并显著提升了持续学习的表现。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext
customer-support dataset and proprietary telecom datasets demonstrate high
prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Result: CWMI在零样本物理推理任务中表现显著优于现有模型，包括PIQA数据集和全新PhysiCa-Bench数据集。

Conclusion: 整合因果世界模型是实现更可靠和具普适性人工智能的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

TL;DR: 本文研究了跨客户端成员推断攻击（CC-MIA）在联邦图神经网络（FedGNNs）中的表现，发现通过分析训练中图的数据和模型行为，可以高效地主动推断样本归属客户端身份暴露的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图神经网络在联邦学习环境中的应用增长，图结构与去中心化训练的结合可能带来新的隐私泄露威胁。

Method: 设计了一种通用的攻击框架，利用FedGNN的聚合行为、梯度更新及嵌入邻近性，跨训练轮次将样本关联到数据所属客户端。

Result: 在多种图数据集和现实联邦学习设置中实验，结果显示提出的方法在成员推断和所属客户端身份识别上均表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦图学习中因结构和模型线索导致的隐私威胁，强调了设计抗归属推断的GNN模型的必要性。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

*Yue Hu,Zanxia Cao,Yingchao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的优化方法DEO，能够提高深度神经网络训练过程中在复杂损失景观中的表现，特别是针对鞍点和平坦区域的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶优化方法如SGD和Adam尽管计算高效，但在复杂的损失景观中会受限，尤其是面对平坦区域、台阶和鞍点时。二阶方法虽然可解决这些问题，但计算成本极高。因此需要一种高效且能捕捉曲率信息的方法。

Method: 提出Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO)方法，通过借鉴Dimer方法，用仅基于梯度信息的方式估算曲率，并通过最小曲率方向的正交分量投影优化。

Result: 在Transformer玩具模型上的初步实验显示，DEO在导航复杂损失景观时表现优异，与传统一阶方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: DEO利用物理启发的曲率估算方法，有效增强了神经网络在高维空间中训练的效率，是一项重要的改进。

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

capabilities for taxi fares using a real-world dataset comprising over 55
million records. Both raw (noisy) and denoised versions of the dataset are
analyzed to assess the impact of data quality on model performance. The study
evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy,
calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and
feature sensitivity. We also explore pre-processing strategies, including KNN
imputation, Gaussian noise injection, and autoencoder-based denoising. The
study reveals critical differences between classical and deep learning models
under realistic conditions, offering practical guidelines for building robust
and scalable models in urban fare prediction systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了联邦学习（FL）中的泛化能力问题，提出了FedSWA及其改进算法FedMoSWA，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其在异构数据场景下的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对联邦学习在高异质性数据环境下性能下降的问题（如FedSAM泛化能力弱于FedAvg），研究更优的算法来提升其泛化能力。

Method: 提出了两个新算法：FedSWA，通过随机权重平均寻求更平坦的极小值；FedMoSWA，引入基于动量的随机控制权重平均以更好对齐本地和全局模型。此外，进行了收敛性和泛化界的理论分析。

Result: 理论证明FedMoSWA的优化和泛化误差均优于FedSAM及其变种。实验（CIFAR10/100和Tiny ImageNet）结果也证实了新算法的性能优势。

Conclusion: FedSWA和FedMoSWA在解决高异质性数据环境下的联邦学习泛化问题中表现优越，理论与实验表明其在优化和泛化性能上均具优势，并提供开源代码用于验证和复现。

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的交叉验证方法——无冗余k折交叉验证，避免了传统方法中的数据冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k折交叉验证中数据点重复利用，影响了学习过程并可能引入过拟合问题。

Method: 提出无冗余k折交叉验证方法，每个数据点在整个验证过程中仅使用一次作为训练和测试数据，且保持分层特性、模型无关性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种数据集上表现稳定，与传统k折交叉验证性能相当，但具有更低的乐观方差估计和显著降低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 无冗余k折交叉验证方法平衡了数据利用，缓解了过拟合问题，并提升了模型分析的差异性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

Motivation: 现有的日志异常检测方法通常运行缓慢，依赖容易出错的日志解析，且评估协议不切实际。作者旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出基于k近邻统计的四维特征描述方法 (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage)，使无需重新训练的轻量级检测器能够精确评估异常。

Result: 基于更现实的在线评估协议，$K^4$框架在AUROC值（0.995-0.999）上大幅超越基线方法，同时具备极高的速度效率（训练<4秒，推理低至4微秒）。

Conclusion: $K^4$框架显著提升了日志异常检测的性能和效率，解决了现有方法中的关键问题。

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on
error-prone parsing, and use unrealistic evaluation protocols. We introduce
$K^4$, an unsupervised and parser-independent framework for high-performance
online detection. $K^4$ transforms arbitrary log embeddings into compact
four-dimensional descriptors (Precision, Recall, Density, Coverage) using
efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a
more realistic online evaluation protocol, $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art
(AUROC: 0.995-0.999), outperforming baselines by large margins while being
orders of magnitude faster, with training under 4 seconds and inference as low
as 4 $\mu$s.

Result: 所提出的方法能够有效促进特征学习，并在多种场景下提高泛化性能，包括grokking现象、神经网络热启动训练以及强化学习任务。

Conclusion: 调节学习率以促进特征学习是一种解决非平稳学习问题中首要偏向的有效手段。

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的模型隐私，防止窃听者通过捕获模型更新信息来恢复模型参数。

Method: 将模型学习视为参数估计问题，引入参数更新的偏移量，使得偏移量的费舍尔信息矩阵达到奇异从而增加估计难度，并安全共享偏移量以保持模型精度。设计收敛性测试以检测模型更新是否被篡改。

Result: 数值实验显示，该方案在实现更高模型偏移的同时，所需的带宽密钥通道比噪声注入方案更低。

Conclusion: 本文提出的偏移保护方案在提升隐私保护效果的同时，兼顾了带宽效率和模型精度，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

<details>

Motivation: 社交媒体上的用户生成内容（UGC）易受到煽动和操控，因而需要有效的监管与审核方法。

Method: 通过机制设计的理论框架，以最大化言论自由和最小化社会扭曲为目标，提出了实用的方法来近似最优解决方案，并提供了泛化保证。

Result: 总结了离线数据对近似最优审核的影响，并提出了有效的审核机制设计方法。

Conclusion: 通过机制设计优化了内容审核策略，在平衡言论自由和减少社会扭曲之间达成了较优结果。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

Motivation: 现有几何学习方法通常依赖于固定的网格、图或点云，但它们在灵活性和效率上存在局限性。本文旨在通过引入基于实例的最优传输方法克服这些局限性，特别是在复杂几何和高度可变数据集中的表现。

Method: 方法将离散网格推广为网格密度函数，并通过OT问题将这些函数嵌入到参考空间的均匀密度下。应用于 3D 模拟时，利用 OT 方法将表面几何嵌入到二维潜在空间进行计算，从而显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 采用基于实例的OT变形方法能够有效提升算子学习的灵活性和性能，同时在复杂几何问题中展现明显优势。

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Motivation: 解决带偏辅助数据对增强OPE中置信区间估计不准确的问题，尤其在医疗等高风险场景中至关重要。

Method: 提出两种方法：1)基于高维状态MDPs的共形预测，生成特定初始状态的置信区间；2)利用双稳健估计和基于预测的推断，估计多个初始状态的平均策略性能。

Conclusion: 新方法能在辅助数据增强情况下可靠地估计OPE的置信区间，为高风险应用场景提供更可信的决策依据。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

Motivation: 当前用于代码处理的预训练模型无法充分表征类内语义间的细微差异，影响了等价代码变异检测任务表现。

Result: 基于UniXCoder，所提出方法在等价变异检测任务中达到最新的性能，并生成更具解释性的嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 该方法有效增强模型在捕获类内语义特征的能力，为下游分类任务带来显著提升。

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

Method: 1. 定义图上的离散Sobolev空间，用于标量/矢量场的功能性质分析；2. 引入具有可证明稳定性和对输入数据及图权重平滑依赖性的非线性Schrödinger和Landau--Lifshitz动力学；3. 开发了带稀疏正则化的基于图调制空间的随机梯度算法。

Result: 理论上，该方法可以保证拓扑正确性（同调恢复）、度量收敛性（Gromov--Hausdorff）和高效的搜索空间利用率。同时，该动力学模型在复杂性依赖于数据流形拓扑的情况下表现出优于标准神经网络的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文的方法通过动态模型结合几何与拓扑理论，不仅改进了对隐藏图结构的学习，还在拓扑和度量意义上都提供了严格的理论保证，同时展现了比传统方法更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data
using geometric analysis and nonlinear dynamics. Our approach: (1) Defines
discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs for scalar/vector fields, establishing key
functional properties; (2) Introduces gauge-equivalent nonlinear Schr\"odinger
and Landau--Lifshitz dynamics with provable stable stationary solutions
smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic
gradient algorithm over graph moduli spaces with sparsity regularization.
Theoretically, we guarantee: topological correctness (homology recovery),
metric convergence (Gromov--Hausdorff), and efficient search space utilization.
Our dynamics-based model achieves stronger generalization bounds than standard
neural networks, with complexity dependent on the data manifold's topology.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Meta Fusion的框架，统一了多模态数据融合的早期、中期和后期方法，并通过软信息共享和模型集成提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过解决多模态数据融合难题，提升机器学习在自动驾驶和医疗诊断等领域中的预测能力。

Method: 提出了基于深度互学习与集成学习的Meta Fusion框架，通过软信息共享机制构建多模态的潜在表示模型集合。

Result: Meta Fusion在模拟研究和实际应用，如阿尔茨海默症检测和神经解码中表现优于传统融合方法。

Conclusion: Meta Fusion框架统一了传统融合方法，具有灵活性和高效性，能显著提升多模态数据的预测性能，同时降低模型的泛化误差。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的Transformer架构EcoTransformer，通过引入非矩阵乘法的卷积方法优化计算效率，同时减少能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的标量点积注意力机制计算强度高且能耗大，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: EcoTransformer用L1度量下的Laplacian核卷积来替代传统的标量点积注意力得分计算，去掉了矩阵乘法的过程。

Result: 在NLP、生物信息学和视觉任务中，EcoTransformer表现与标量点积注意力机制相当甚至更优，并显著降低了能耗。

Conclusion: EcoTransformer既提高了性能，又降低了计算资源和能量消耗，是标量点积注意力机制的高效替代方案。

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分级Transformer框架，包括两种架构：Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) 和 Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT)。这个框架通过分级变换将代数偏置嵌入多层网络中，提高对结构化数据的学习效率和多功能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求将代数和几何原理结合到深度学习模型中，尤其是在需要处理复杂的结构化数据时，提升模型的效率、泛化能力和可解释性。

Method: 提出分级网络的扩展方法，通过分级参数化缩放操作（包括指数因子和可学习梯度）引入层级结构，从而优化attention机制和特征表征。此外，通过定义支持域知识的分级损失函数确保训练的鲁棒性和梯度稳定性。

Conclusion: Graded Transformer框架是一种数据驱动模型的替代方案，为自然语言处理、生物序列分析等领域构建了一个具有可解释性、效率和鲁棒性的层级学习体系，推动了结构化深度学习的发展。

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了PUCS框架，用于解决在信息获取下的序列决策问题，并基于已知和未知分布分别设计了算法，证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源和收益信息未知且探测成本高的实际问题，如网约车调度、无线调度和内容推荐。

Method: 提出了用于离线问题的贪心探测算法（具有恒定因子近似保证）以及针对在线问题的stochastic combinatorial bandit算法OLPA（具有$O$($\sqrt{T}$ + $\ln^{2} T$) 的遗憾界限）。

Result: 离线算法达到了(e-1)/(2e-1)的近似保证，OLPA算法的遗憾界限达到了上下界的对数紧。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了PUCS框架和所提算法在真实数据中的有效性，兼顾理论保证和实践可行性。

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

TL;DR: 研究利用UV-Vis光谱数据结合机器学习方法预测葡萄汁属性及分类葡萄酒产地，SVM模型的预测准确率超过91％。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过结合光谱技术和机器学习，改进传统葡萄酒分析方法，提高对葡萄酒感官数据和产地的分析精度。

Method: 采用UV-Vis扫描光谱仪获取数据，利用机器学习（如SVM），预测葡萄汁属性和葡萄酒产地，并通过特征重要性分析确定关键波长范围。

Result: SVM模型在属性预测和产地分类任务中的表现最为高效鲁棒，产地分类的准确率和F1得分均超过91%，并确定关键波长范围为250nm至420nm。

Conclusion: 研究为葡萄酒及相关行业在智能化和数据化发展方面提供了新思路，并为未来集成物联网和大数据技术打下基础，促进“智慧酒庄”发展。

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart
Wineries'.

*Xuanting Xie,Bingheng Li,Erlin Pan,Zhao Kang,Wenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了AMLP，一种针对异构图自适应聚合的新型方法，相较于传统GNN模型，在无监督场景下性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN模型通常采用固定的聚合函数，而这些固定的聚合方式在处理异构图时往往表现不佳，因此需要一种更加灵活和自适应的方法，该方法应减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 提出了一种名为聚合感知的多层感知机(AMLP)的框架，其步骤包括：1-利用图重构方法增强高阶特征组效果；2-采用单层网络对不同异构性进行编码。

Result: 在节点聚类与分类任务上的实验表明，AMLP在性能上显著优于传统GNN方法，并适用于多样化的图数据场景。

Conclusion: AMLP减少了对标注数据的依赖，提升了模型适应异构图学习的能力，并展示了其在无监督学习中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

Result: 验证了MEVO可以高效生成多种目标蛋白的高亲和力配体，并成功设计出对KRAS^G12D抑制剂在结合亲和力上与已知高效配体相当的分子。

Conclusion: MEVO以高适应性和通用性为特点，提供了一种数据高效模型，适用于多种结构性配体设计任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经网络架构设计多依赖经验或搜索策略，缺乏有效的方法将网络结构与性能直接关联，因此需要一种工具来预测性能更优的架构。

Method: 作者设计了ASNN模型，通过TensorFlow构建包含不同层数和节点数的架构数据集，实验采集2层和3层架构的精度数据，并以此训练ASNN模型，用于预测改进架构。

Conclusion: ASNN提供了一种有效的架构优化替代方案，有望推动神经网络设计的自动化进程。

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于重要性采样的迁移学习方法IS$^2$C，用于解决部分领域适配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分领域适配需要应对源域与目标域标签分布不匹配的问题，而现有方法在标签分布修正上效果有限，并容易导致模型过拟合。

Method: 提出IS$^2$C方法，通过构建采样域采样新的标注数据，结合基于最优传输的条件分布对齐准则，实现迁移学习中的分布修正和模型泛化能力提升。

Result: 理论分析表明，IS$^2$C可以有效控制泛化误差；实验表明该方法在PDA基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS$^2$C通过采样域构建和条件分布对齐，不仅改进了标签分布修正方法，还增强了模型的泛化能力，在部分领域适配问题上显示了优越性能。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in

modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

Result: 在六大中美股票指数上的实验表明，TLRS将排名信息系数提升了9.29%，显著超过现有算法，并将时间复杂度从线性降低到常数水平，极大提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: TLRS有效解决了现有方法的稀疏奖励问题，显著改善了金融因子挖掘的预测性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Method: 本文提出一种近似全体一致性预测(full-CP)的方法，通过高斯-牛顿影响局部扰动模型参数实现无需为每个测试点重新训练；结合网络线性化，使得绝对残差非一致性得分能被表达为候选标签的分段线性函数，从而提高计算效率。

Result: 在标准回归基准和边界框定位的任务中，结果表明提出的方法生成的预测区间局部自适应且比split-CP的区间更紧凑。

Conclusion: 该方法在不牺牲统计效率的情况下提供了更高效和准确的预测区间，适合需要不确定性量化的深度学习模型部署场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态无限聚合物序列预训练框架（MIPS）的新方法，用于聚合物性质预测，集成拓扑和空间信息，实验验证表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以全面捕获聚合物性质，尤其是在聚合过程中性质变化的情况。

Method: 提出MIPS框架，将聚合物表示为由单体组成的无限序列，结合拓扑信息（通过改进的消息传递机制和图注意力机制）和空间信息（通过三维描述符提取），并设计了跨模态融合机制。

Result: 在八个不同的聚合物性质预测任务中，MIPS实现了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: MIPS框架有效整合了拓扑和空间信息，是一种能够更准确预测聚合物性质的创新方法。

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统大语言模型在教育领域中缺乏帮助性、个性化和创造性的问题，促进其与教育原则的对齐。

Method: 第一阶段：创建8k教育交互数据集，并基于帮助性、个性化和创造性（HPC）进行手动和自动注释，训练多维度奖励模型HPC-RM。第二阶段：使用HPC-RM作为奖励信号，通过群体相对策略优化对预训练的LLM进行微调。

Conclusion: EduAlign提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法，使LLM能够更好地符合教育需求，朝着打造更具吸引力和教育意义的AI导师迈出重要一步。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

Conclusion: 该框架突破了传统方法的局限性，为晶圆缺陷根因分析提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

Motivation: 自动识别系统(AIS)数据的缺失值问题影响了其在海事安全和监测中的应用，现有方法不足以处理多尺度依赖性，限制了补全精度。

Method: 提出MH-GIN模型，利用多尺度时间特征提取和异构图构建技术捕捉异构属性间的多尺度依赖性，并通过图传播机制进行数据缺失值补全。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，MH-GIN比最先进方法平均减少57%的补全误差，同时保有计算效率。

Conclusion: MH-GIN有效提高了数据缺失值补全的精度，为海事安全与监控应用提供了更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Conclusion: WBHT框架有效提高了异常检测的效率和准确性，适合用于任务关键型网络的主动监控和安全保障。

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical
networks.

Conclusion: DPPF算法通过设计合理的拉推动态，使分布式训练达到更好的通信效率及模型泛化效果，并提供了理论上的泛化保证与收敛性证明。

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度学习架构结合全局蛋白表征，在多种数据上下文中提供准确可靠的DBP预测，具备较高的泛化能力。

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological

network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional
representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular
networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of
multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction
techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of
downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN
architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,
scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick
adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively
documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics
network analysis in precision medicine.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer在处理非线性回归任务中的模型学习动态，揭示了注意力得分在训练过程中的阶段性变化，并将Lipschitz常数与收敛动态联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer如何在更复杂的非线性回归任务下获得上下文学习能力，为任务未知的情形提供理论分析。

Method: 利用新的证明方法，详细研究了Transformer的注意力权重如何受到非退化L-Lipschitz函数的影响，并基于L的大小推导了不同的收敛时间界限。

Result: 通过分析，发现查询令牌会在收敛时始终关注与任务相关的提示令牌，验证了Transformer在处理未知任务时的上下文学习能力。

Conclusion: Transformer能够以上下文学习功能对抗更复杂的非线性任务，并且Lipschitz常数是其性能的关键要素。

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

Motivation: 推动非专家实践者高效解决机器学习任务，减少对专家知识和经验的依赖。

Method: 设计BOASF算法，结合贝叶斯优化进行候选配置选择，并基于高斯UCB模型通过ASF逐步丢弃表现差的选项，同时使用Softmax模型资源分配机制优化配置。

Result: 实验结果表明BOASF在加速模型选择和超参数优化方面表现出色，并提供比现有方法更好的预测性能和即时性能。

Conclusion: BOASF在模型选择与超参数优化领域展示了在效率、性能和鲁棒性方面的优势，是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Motivation: 解决稀疏正则化中的一个核心矛盾：强稀疏诱导惩罚的非可微性与目前主流优化器的梯度需求之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty (WEEP)，通过弱凸包框架设计，实现了全可微性、L-平滑性，并兼具强稀疏效果。

Result: 在信号与图像去噪任务上，WEEP相较于L1范数及其他非凸稀疏正则化方法表现优异。

Conclusion: WEEP在统计性能与计算可行性中实现了良好平衡，是一种创新型稀疏正则化工具。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为对角加权广义矩估计（DGMM）的新方法，用于解决高维高斯混合模型中的参数估计问题，并展示了其在统计效率、计算复杂性和数值稳定性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩的估计方法（如广义矩法GMM）虽然在统计效率上有提升，但在计算复杂性和存储复杂性上增长迅速，特别是在处理高维数据或高阶矩时，现有方法变得不切实际。因此，需要一种方法能平衡统计效率与计算复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种新方法——对角加权广义矩估计（DGMM），通过对矩的权重进行对角化处理，减少了宽大的加权矩阵的估计需求，并提出了一种计算效率高且数值稳定的算法，无需显式存储或计算高阶矩张量。

Result: 在数值实验中，DGMM相较于传统方法（MM和GMM），表现出估计误差更小且运行时间显著缩短，同时实现了更好的计算效率和数值稳定性。

Conclusion: DGMM实现了统计效率、计算复杂性和数值稳定性的良好平衡，为高维和复杂的概率模型提供了更为可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了一种基于Shapley值的图稀疏化算法，其能高效移除对GNN推理影响较小的边，同时保持预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前很多GNN可解释性方法生成的局部重要性分数仅为非负，无法有效区分对预测有不利影响的边和有利的边。因此，需要一种更全面评估边重要性的方法。

Method: 本文采用基于Shapley值的方法，通过评估图的多个子集，分配正负贡献分数，从而实现对影响大的边的保留和对误导性或对抗性边的去除。

Result: 通过实验验证，基于Shapley值的图稀疏化方法在显著减少图复杂度的同时，维持了预测性能并提高了推理的可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: Shapley值方法为图稀疏化提供了更加健壮和公平的解决方案，其在提高GNN推理效率和可解释性方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

Conclusion: 基于判例的方法避免了固定政策的局限性，显著提升了安全保障模型的灵活性和适应性，为动态多政策环境下的内容过滤提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

Motivation: 现有卫星降水数据存在显著的缺失区域，当前插值方法容易导致空间不连续性，急需新的解决方案提高全球降水监测能力。

Method: 将降水图的补全问题建模为视频修复任务，采用基于条件扩散模型的机器学习方法，用3D U-Net结合3D条件编码器进行空间-时间信息的重建。

Result: 实验基于2020到2023年的ERA5数据进行训练，生成伪GSMaP数据集以评估算法，2024年的测试结果显示新方法生成的降水图在时间和空间上更加一致，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 基于条件扩散模型的方法有潜力显著改善全球降水监测效果。

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前超图神经网络（HNNs）在实现复杂系统的高阶交互任务时表现出色，但高质量标注数据昂贵，需引入高效的主动学习方法。然而，现有图主动学习方法破坏了超图的高阶结构信息，表现有限。

Method: 本文提出HIAL框架，将超图主动学习问题重新表述为影响力最大化任务，并引入了基于“高阶交互感知”机制的双视角影响函数，从特征覆盖和拓扑传播两个维度评估节点影响力，同时通过贪心算法实现高效优化。

Conclusion: HIAL框架为超图主动学习提供了一个高效且有力的新范式，克服了传统方法的局限，显著提升了超图主动学习的表现。

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

Conclusion: DmC框架有效解决了有限目标数据下跨领域离线RL中的关键挑战,并显著提升了策略学习的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为MPCCL的创新模型，用于解决现有图聚类方法中的长程依赖、特征塌陷和信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征提取和图粗化方法无法有效解析高阶图特征及保持精细结构，同时对比学习方法过于依赖局部邻域，导致特征多样性不足。

Method: MPCCL采用多尺度权重的图粗化策略与一对多对比学习范式，结合图重构损失和KL散度实现跨尺度一致性，并通过保留关键边与整合多视图嵌入提升特征多样性和结构保持能力。

Result: 实验表明，MPCCL在多个数据集上的聚类性能显著提升，例如ACM数据集的NMI增加了15.24%，在其他数据集上也实现了稳定收益。

Conclusion: MPCCL模型在提升图聚类性能、促进特征多样性以及信息保持方面具有显著优势，为解决现有方法局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

*Yining Huang,Bin Li,Keke Tang,Meilian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为LoRA-PAR的新框架，通过将任务数据和参数根据系统需求拆分为System 1（快速、直觉性）和System 2（深度逻辑推理）两类型，以更高效地改进生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在提升大规模生成模型性能时需要大量数据、模型参数和训练成本。现有参数高效微调方法（PEFT）大多局限于领域迁移或分层分配，未能充分针对不同需求调整数据和参数。

Method: 借鉴“快思慢想”理论，提出LoRA-PAR框架，将任务数据和参数划分为两种系统，System 1任务用监督微调方法强化知识直觉，System 2任务用强化学习策略加强逻辑推理能力。通过多模型投票分类任务数据和基于重要性评分划分参数，以两阶段微调框架进行训练。

Result: 实验证明，该两阶段微调策略在降低参数使用量的同时，可以达到或超越现有SOTA PEFT基线效果。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR框架通过更少且更集中的参数分配，高效提升生成模型的任务表现，验证了“快思慢想”模式在参数分配上的实际价值。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,
involving sequential surface-by-surface computations, which can be
computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

Result: KOBO 方法在合成基准函数和现实应用中表现超越现有技术，显著降低了样本要求。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低样本预算的同时实现了有效的黑箱优化，在实际场景中具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

Result: 在多个数据集和传统及深度学习模型上测试表明，STAFF在精度和公平性之间提供了最佳权衡，相较于次优基线，STAFF的MSE降低了36%，MADE降低了59%。

Conclusion: STAFF方法在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升了群体公平性，展示出相较现有方法的优势。

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

Conclusion: DAG-AFL框架显著改善了区块链联邦学习的效率与效果，为资源有限的无线设备提供了潜在优势。

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的近似机洗技术虽然高效，但会引入隐含的残余，导致未被遗忘数据面临隐私泄露风险。

Method: 提出Reminiscence Attack (ReA)来利用残余特性进行攻击，并设计双阶段近似机洗框架，通过去除深层数据痕迹和稳定收敛防止伪收敛。

Result: 实验表明，ReA比以往攻击更为有效，而新框架降低隐私攻击准确率至随机水平，计算开销仅为完全重训练的2-12%。

Conclusion: 双阶段框架在分类和生成任务中既达到了高效的“遗忘”，又显著降低了隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了在不同流动条件下的预测能力，也在物理一致性上显著优于线性方法，未来有望用于更复杂的神经网络架构。

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

Conclusion: PhaseNAS在多种视觉任务中证明了其高效性、自适应性和可推广性，是一种更高效的NAS整体解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

Conclusion: 该模型证明了深度生成模型能有效表示进化过程数据，尤其是在高连锁不平衡情况下的Pool-Seq数据中具有潜力。

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进Cholesky分解的选择策略，应对因早期终止导致的效率低的问题，尤其在贝叶斯非参数推理中提供更好的不确定性优化。

Method: 引入了替代的选择策略，结合贪婪熵最大化的原理，并实现了更具针对性的算法以提升效率，同时支持包括观测信息更新。

Result: 在高斯过程的重要任务（稀疏回归和基于预条件迭代求解器的推理）中，提出的方法与传统基准方法表现相当，在大多数情况下表现更为优越，且额外计算成本很低。

Conclusion: 新策略不仅提高了算法效率，还能更好地减少数据集不确定性，适用于多种高斯过程任务，展现了强大的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824

Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在不同领域的表现相差较大，单一模型难以在所有任务中表现优异，因此需要使用集成方法结合模型的互补优势。同时，现有集成方法忽略了模型特异性的不确定性，限制了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过不确定性建模，UEC有效结合了多模型的优势，为嵌入模型集成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测方法难以捕获建筑操作数据中的空间依赖性和能量模式。

Method: 构建基于图的建筑特征和环境因素表示，使用包含注意力机制的多层次图卷积架构进行预测，并引入图结构的解释方法。

Result: 在Building Data Genome Project 2数据集上，实验结果优于传统方法（如XGBoost、SVR等），证明了方法的鲁棒性、泛化性及解释能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效捕捉了建筑相似性与空间关系，表现出优异的预测性能和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

TL;DR: 本论文综述可解释的时间序列深度聚类方法，对现有方法进行了系统化分析，并提出了推动该领域发展的六个研究机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度聚类在复杂时间序列数据中可发现隐藏模式和群组，但其不透明的决策过程限制了其在安全关键领域的应用。

Method: 综述现有可解释的时间序列深度聚类方法，重点关注其在健康、金融、物联网和气候科学等领域的应用，并提出研究机会以改进这些方法。

Result: 分析发现大多数方法依赖于自编码器和注意力机制架构，对数据流、非规则采样或隐私保护的支持有限，可解释性仍然被视为附加功能。

Conclusion: 可解释性应作为设计的核心目标，而非事后补充，以提升深度聚类在时间序列分析中的可信性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数理论工作集中在有限状态和动作空间，而复杂任务常涉及连续的状态和动作空间，因此需要新的理论理解。

Method: 通过半梯度方法研究策略参数化的状态集合，分析两层神经网络策略训练中状态空间的低维流形特性。

Conclusion: 提出的理论帮助理解复杂控制任务中状态与动作空间的联系，并通过流形学习改进高维控制任务的性能。

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

*Shomoita Jahid Mitin,Rodrigue Rizk,Maximilian Scherer,Thomas Koeglsperger,Daniel Lench,KC Santosh,Arun Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种多模态Bi-cephalic Self-Attention Model (BiSAM)，结合静息状态EEG信号和人口学及临床变量，用于检测帕金森病相关的步态障碍，尤其针对有冻结步态的患者(PDFOG+)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的步态障碍检测受主观影响大或依赖复杂仪器，本研究的目标是开发一个客观、数据驱动的多模态分类模型，以提高检测精度。

Method: 利用124名参与者的数据，包括静息状态EEG信号和年龄、教育程度、病程等描述变量。通过BiSAM模型，分析信号数据、描述数据以及多模态组合数据，并对不同EEG通道数量进行性能测试。

Result: 信号单一和描述单一模型的最高准确率分别为55%和68%，而多模态模型显著优于两者，其中BiSAM-8和BiSAM-4的分类准确率达到88%。

Conclusion: 多模态注意力架构有效整合EEG信号和描述变量，实现对PDFOG+的客观分类，用少量EEG通道和描述变量即能达到高效且可扩展的检测目标，可用于临床监测和早期诊断。

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出iHOMER，一种在线多标签学习框架，用增量方式分割标签空间，并通过多元Bernoulli过程与漂移检测机制进行动态调整，实验结果表明其性能优于当前主流方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多标签数据流挖掘面临分布变化、标签依赖、稀疏性和概念漂移等挑战，需优化模型适应性。

Method: 提出iHOMER框架，通过Jaccard相似度进行增量式划分标签簇，结合基于多元Bernoulli过程的全局学习器及漂移检测机制动态调整模型结构。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上，iHOMER优于5种全局方法23%和12种局部方法32%。

Conclusion: iHOMER在处理在线多标签分类任务时表现出卓越的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LANTERN的模块化架构，通过结合适应性调查响应与外部上下文信号来建模用户行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调查方法受限于用户疲劳、不完整响应以及长度限制，无法充分捕捉用户行为，作者旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出LANTERN架构，通过选择性门控、残差连接和跨注意力等技术，将调查数据作为主要信号，同时根据需要融合外部模态。

Result: LANTERN在调查响应的多标签预测上优于强基线模型，并通过消融实验分析了模态依赖的效益及罕见/频繁属性的影响。

Conclusion: LANTERN是一种模块化、可扩展的行为建模工具，特别适用于以调查为中心的应用场景。

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

Motivation: 零样本CPI预测更贴近实际需求，现有方法在蛋白质序列依赖关系捕捉以及需求大规模数据所需资源方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了基于亚序列重排的蛋白质预训练方法，并结合长度可变的增强策略，以在小数据集上获得优异结果。

Result: 模型在CPI任务上显著提升了基线性能，尤其在零样本及数据稀缺场景表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的方法更有效地捕捉了蛋白质序列之间的依赖关系，在零样本预测及小样本场景中展现优异表现，为实际药物开发提供潜在价值。

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/Hoch-Zhang/PSRP-CPI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合傅里叶-神经架构，有效打破了物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在求解四阶偏微分方程时的精度瓶颈，达到前所未有的超高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PINNs在解决高阶微分方程时精度停滞，限制了其在工程中的应用。本研究旨在突破这一精度瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种混合傅里叶-神经架构，结合截断的傅里叶级数和深度神经网络，并使用两阶段优化策略（Adam+L-BFGS）以及自适应权重平衡来提高优化稳定性。此外，进行了系统谐波优化研究并进行了GPU加速实现。

Result: 利用新的架构在Euler-Bernoulli梁方程上达到了$1.94 \times 10^{-7}$的L2误差，比标准PINNs提升17倍，比传统数值方法提升15-500倍。

Conclusion: 通过解决现有方法的关键瓶颈，该研究展示了通过正确设计，PINNs可以实现甚至超越传统数值方法的超高精度，为科学计算开辟了新的范式。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

Conclusion: ProvCreator实现了高质量的复杂异构图生成，为需要语义复杂图数据的应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列分析中，由于领域转移导致的模型迁移性能下降问题。

Method: 引入DARSD框架，包括：域不变子空间对抗学习、动态伪标注机制及混合对比优化策略，以确保知识迁移和分布对齐。

Result: 在四个基准数据集的35/53种跨领域场景中，DARSD优于12种UDA算法。

Conclusion: DARSD通过构建域不变表征并减少误差累计，实现了领域适配的显著提升。

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SAE Debias的新方法，用于减少文本到图像(T2I)扩散模型中的性别偏见，无需重新训练或修改模型架构，通过稀疏自动编码器识别偏见方向并进行调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对T2I扩散模型存在的性别偏见问题，本研究提出了一种轻量级且模型无关的解决方案，旨在减少职业与性别刻板印象之间的不公平关联。

Method: 通过使用预训练在性别偏见数据集上的k-稀疏自动编码器，识别稀疏潜在空间中与性别相关的偏见方向，在推理过程中抑制这些方向以产生更平衡的输出。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, SDXL）上的验证表明，SAE Debias有效减少了性别偏见，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 通过稀疏自动编码器识别和干预性别偏见的首个研究，为公平的文本到图像生成提供了可解释且模型无关的解决方案，推动了社会责任型生成式AI的发展。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 推动 LLMs 从云端环境更多地转向可在本地设备上运行，解决设备性能和资源限制的困难。

Method: 设计了基于部署约束的架构，采用两级稀疏结构、高效的预注意力路由器以及NoPE-RoPE混合稀疏注意力机制，优化模型的计算、存储和内存使用。

Result: SmallThinker 系列模型实现了4B和21B参数量下的状态领先性能，并可在普通消费级CPU下以超过20 tokens/s的速度运行。

Conclusion: 通过专门为本地设备设计的创新架构，SmallThinker 模型展现出在性能与硬件需求之间的显著平衡性能，适应性强并具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

TL;DR: 提出MDM-OC框架，用于可扩展、无干扰、可逆地合并与更新模型，并在视觉与自然语言处理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型合并与持续学习中的任务干扰、遗忘及不可逆问题。

Method: 提出MDM-OC框架，通过将任务特定模型表示为共享基模型的增量，并使用正交约束消除冲突，使用梯度优化合并模型。

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MDM-OC在准确性、回传迁移与可逆性方面均优于现有方法，同时高效利用内存与计算资源。

Conclusion: MDM-OC提供了一种模块化、合规的AI系统设计解决方案，支持模型的持续集成与逆向分解。

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络因“黑箱”性质而限制其在需要透明性的高风险领域应用的问题。

Method: 开发一种通过组合具有明确语义的基本数学函数来构建具有透明可解释性的模型，支持多种复合模式，并可通过标准梯度下降高效训练。

Result: CFNs能够在多个领域展现出灵活性，例如符号回归到图像分类，同时在与黑箱模型性能相近的情况下（如CIFAR-10上的96.24%准确率），超越现有可解释模型的性能。

Conclusion: CFNs提供了一个强大的框架，在需要性能与透明性兼顾的应用中，结合了深度学习的层次化表达性与数学上良定义函数的内在可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

Motivation: 预测健康个体的认知能力可深入了解认知能力背后的神经机制，并在精准医疗与早期检测神经精神疾病中具有潜在应用价值。

Method: 系统比较经典机器学习（核岭回归）与深度学习模型（图神经网络与变压器图神经网络）通过静息态与任务态fMRI数据预测认知行为的表现。

Result: 任务态fMRI数据的认知预测准确性优于静息态数据；结合结构与功能连接性的图神经网络表现最佳，但其优势未显著超越基于功能连接性的核岭回归模型。

Conclusion: 多模态神经图网络有望提升认知预测的效果，同时变压器模型在捕捉时间动态特性方面具有潜力。这项研究为利用fMRI和深度学习进行脑行为建模提供了全面指导。

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

Motivation: 当前关于Shapley值用于异常定位的研究有一定复杂性，作者希望探讨是否可以通过简化计算模型降低复杂度。

Method: 提出并测试了在Shapley值计算中仅使用单一固定项的简化方法，同时提供证明以验证独立观测情况下的有效性。

Result: 实验显示，简化计算在独立观测情况下具有与完整Shapley值计算相同的错误概率，但实验没有涵盖相关依赖观测的情况。

Conclusion: 对于独立观测场景，简化方法可以有效替代完整Shapley值计算，但尚需进一步研究以验证在相关依赖观测条件下的表现。

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for
all cases tested. A proof demonstrates these conclusions must be true for all
independent observation cases. For dependent observation cases, no proof is
available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进现有FMA方法的序列数据集构建方法，限制最近增加数据点的数量，从而提高模型预测能力，减少函数评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FMA在优化迭代次数增加后性能停滞，可能由于新数据点的贡献在整体数据集中被稀释，降低了FM模型的预测准确性。

Method: 提出了一种限制最新数据点数量的序列数据集构建方法，目的为增强新增数据点对代理模型的影响力。

Result: 数值实验表明，该改进FMA方法相比传统FMA，能以更少的黑箱函数评估次数达到更低的优化成本。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入新的序列数据集构建方法，显著提升了FMA的优化性能。

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大脑基础模型(BFM)的新MSDA框架，通过智能选择源域及联合对齐特征与决策，提高了跨领域适应的效率与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MI-EEG解码面临跨主体数据差异大和目标数据标注有限的问题，而现有MSDA方法难以有效应对这些挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的大脑基础模型(BFM)动态选择相关源域，并采用CS和CCS散度联合实现特征层与决策层的对齐。

Result: 在两个MI-EEG基准数据集上的性能优于当前多种方法，并通过实验验证了框架的扩展性与效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在提高MI-EEG解码精度的同时显著减少了训练时间，表明了其在BCI领域的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出将transformer解释为基于ProbDR框架的概率Laplacian Eigenmaps模型的解卷积推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望从概率角度理解transformer的机制，并探索改进其性能的方法。

Method: 通过推导显示transformer初始化时执行'线性'降维，并通过引入图Laplacian来改进attention矩阵。进一步，在attention矩阵上减去单位矩阵进行图扩散步骤。

Result: 使用该方法在语言模型和简单视觉transformer上改进了验证性能。

Conclusion: 通过这种图扩散策略，可以提升transformer的性能，从概率角度也提供了一种新的理解模型的方法。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

Motivation: 现有多任务优化方法过于依赖优化器调整但效果不佳，而共享表示空间的潜力尚未被充分开发。

Method: 提出Rep-MTL方法，通过基于熵的惩罚和跨任务对齐，在共享表示空间中量化和引导任务间的互补性与交互。

Result: 在任务转换和领域转换的两类场景中的四个多任务学习基准上，Rep-MTL取得了较大性能提升并展现出效率优势。

Conclusion: Rep-MTL不仅改善了任务间的评估性能，还通过幂律指数分析验证了其在任务特定学习与跨任务共享间的平衡能力。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) 的方法，将流匹配引入到策略梯度框架中，用于训练连续控制任务中的策略，并超越了传统高斯政策的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在连续控制任务中政策优化方法难以处理多模态分布和高性能策略的问题，同时减少对精确似然计算的依赖。

Method: FPO通过将政策优化表述为优势加权的条件流匹配损失比值的最大化过程，兼容PPO-clip框架，且不绑定于特定采样方法，在训练和推理时保持方法的灵活性。

Result: 在各种连续控制任务中，FPO从零开始训练的扩散模型政策能捕获多模态动作分布，并在欠约束场景下取得比高斯政策更高的性能。

Conclusion: FPO不仅有效地利用了流模型的生成能力，还通过灵活的框架改进了连续控制任务中的策略优化质量。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

Conclusion: 通过自适应重置神经元设计优化了尖峰神经网络的信息利用效率与能耗表现，可以在实际应用中展现良好的效果。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

Motivation: 针对MOCOP中的传统进化算法限制（对领域知识和参数调整的依赖）以及现有LLM方法专注于单目标任务的不足。

Method: 通过划分目标空间为网格并保留表现良好的候选者，结合帕累托网格技术和LLM来生成具有语义多样性的启发式策略，从而增强SEMO框架。

Result: MPaGE在性能上优于现有LLM框架，与传统多目标进化算法的结果竞争力强，同时显著加快运行时间。

Conclusion: MPaGE展示了利用LLM提升多目标优化算法效率和多样性的潜力，为多目标问题的自动化解决提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Conclusion: 实现了强大的自动化分类方法，有望成为放射科医生的有效辅助工具，提高肺癌筛查效率。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.
