### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了解决食品图像的少样本学习问题，提出了一种基于随机滤波的补丁过滤方法（SPFF），有效提高了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品图像由于视觉复杂性和变化大，给少样本学习模型带来了挑战，容易导致分类错误。

Method: 提出SPFF方法，通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，仅保留与类别相关的补丁，并利用相似矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: SPFF聚焦于食品图像中类别特定的显著特征，同时过滤掉无关部分，在多个食品分类基准数据集中超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SPFF方法有效解决了食品图像的少样本学习问题，在分类性能上取得了显著的提升。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了DINOv3，一种无需手动数据标注的自监督学习模型，可在各种视觉任务中超过现有技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过自监督学习消除手动数据标注的需求，从而使模型能够轻松扩展至大规模数据集和更大的模型架构，适用于多种领域和任务。

Method: 通过改进数据准备、设计与优化实现数据和模型规模的扩展；提出新的方法Gram anchoring解决密集特征图在长时间训练过程中的退化问题；引入后处理策略提高模型在分辨率、模型大小及文本对齐方面的适应性。

Result: DINOv3模型提供了高质量的密集视觉特征，在多种视觉任务上显著超越了以往的自监督与弱监督基础模型表现。

Conclusion: 设计出了一种多功能的视觉基础模型，不需要微调就能在各种任务中超越现有技术水平，提供了适用于不同资源限制和部署场景的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发一种利用多模态学习来检测面部morphing攻击的方法，该方法基于CLIP模型通过零样本评估来实现广泛的适配性和文本描述能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在面部识别领域，morphing攻击会显著降低验证准确率，因而需要有效的检测方法以保障系统可靠性。

Method: 使用对比语言图像预训练模型（CLIP），结合十种不同文本提示（短文本与长文本），实现带有文本描述的morphing攻击检测，进行了基于公开面部生物识别数据集的实验分析。

Result: 提出的框架在零样本评估中展示了处理五种不同morphing生成技术的能力，并通过三种不同媒体验证了系统性能。

Conclusion: 多模态学习策略和基于CLIP的框架在morphing攻击检测中具有广泛适用性且能生成相关文本描述，对提升面部识别系统可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大规模视觉-语言模型的可解释甲骨文解读方法，通过联合偏旁部首分析与象形-语义理解，显著提高了零样本解读的性能及可解释性，且为数字人文及历史研究提供了有潜力的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有甲骨文解读方式未能有效结合字形与语义间复杂的关系，面临零样本解读能力弱和可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种渐进式训练策略，从偏旁部首识别到象形分析，再到综合分析，并设计了部首-象形双匹配机制，同时引入包含丰富标注的象形解读数据集以提高模型训练性能。

Result: 在公开基准测试中取得了当前最优的Top-10准确率及优异的零样本解读性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够提供逻辑性强的分析过程，对尚未解读的甲骨文可能具有考古学价值，为数字人文及历史研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了一种深度学习方法，用于全身双能X射线吸收法(TBDXA)扫描图像中的自动标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA扫描是一种低成本的身体成分评估工具，研究旨在提高其分析精度及应用潜力。

Method: 使用1683个手动标注的扫描图像训练深度学习模型，并在外部数据集上达到99.5%的关键点正确率。此外，用于35,928个扫描的形状与外观建模(SAM)。

Result: 证明模型生成的新假设与健康生物标志物相关，如虚弱、新陈代谢、炎症和心脏代谢健康，并验证了现有证据。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了深度学习可用于TBDXA扫描的自动化标记，推动形体建模及健康研究。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MANGO的新型多模态融合学习方法，通过新设计的正则化流模型及三种新型跨模态注意力机制，在多模态学习任务中实现SoTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法难以从各模态提取主要特征，无法很好理解复杂的多模态结构与关系。

Method: 通过设计正则化流模型（MANGO）以及三种跨模态注意力机制（MMCA, IMCA, LICA），并引入新的可逆交叉注意力层，提升多模态数据的相关性捕获能力。

Result: 在语义分割、图像翻译及电影类别分类三种任务上实现了SoTA表现。

Conclusion: MANGO模型改进了多模态学习的融合方法，在多个任务上验证了效率及有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究结合真实与生成数据集以提升农作物病害分类模型效果，有效性超过仅用真实图片，验证了混合数据集方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采集培训数据资源消耗大，生成式AI提供了一个生成合成图片来辅助农业计算机视觉任务的替代方案。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，分别测试五种训练数据集（包括不同比例真实和生成图片的混合）。

Result: 结合真实与生成图片训练的模型（如1:10比例）在F1分数等评估指标上达到1.00，大幅优于完全真实数据训练模型。

Conclusion: 完全依赖生成图片不足以替代真实图片，使用混合数据集可显著提高农作物病害分类模型表现。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用高质量合成数据生成管道的方法，通过轻量化的参数高效微调（PEFT），提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）和主流检测器（如YOLO和DETR）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在一般视觉识别任务表现优异，但在数据稀缺、安全性要求高的工业领域表现不佳；尤其因隐私、敏感性及实际事件稀少，传统微调方法难以实施。

Method: 通过开发高质量的合成数据生成管道，构建了SynSpill数据集，并利用参数高效微调方法（PEFT），提高视觉语言模型（VLMs）和检测器的性能。

Result: 即使在没有合成数据的情况下，视觉语言模型在新的泄漏场景的泛化能力仍优于主流检测器；有了SynSpill数据集后，VLMs和检测器均取得显著改进，性能更加接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据可有效弥合工业应用中的领域差异，结合合成数据生成与轻量化适配，为数据稀缺场景的视觉系统部署提供了一种经济、高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该摘要提出了一种名为EntropyGS的熵编码方法，对3D高斯正态分布进行压缩，在渲染质量几乎不变的情况下实现了约30倍的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴的3D高斯喷溅方法对快速训练和高质量渲染提出了要求，因此需要高效的存储和压缩方法。

Method: 通过对3DGS高斯属性进行相关性和统计分析，发现属性遵循特定分布规律，并提出了一种分解和参数化的熵编码方法——EntropyGS。该方法根据高斯属性类型自适应地量化用于熵编码的分布参数。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的压缩率，并兼顾了快速编码/解码以及与原始3DGS数据相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: EntropyGS成功证明了一种高效的熵编码方法在3D高斯喷溅压缩中的潜力，显著提升了存储和传输效率，同时保留了高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Method: 提出CellSymphony框架，利用基础模型的嵌入技术，将空间基因表达和组织形态信息结合，并学习联合表示。

Result: 方法实现了高精度的细胞类型标注，并发现了三种癌症中的微环境特征。

Conclusion: 基础模型和多模态信息融合技术在复杂组织系统中细胞解析方面展现了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MRFD（Multi-Region Fusion Decoding）的方法，用以减少大规模视觉语言模型的幻觉现象，并提高其响应的事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在处理视觉输入时，由于无法有效验证图像不同区域信息一致性而产生幻觉的问题。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的解码方法MRFD，通过建模各区域的一致性来改进事实性。MRFD包括：利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，为每个区域生成初始响应；基于Jensen-Shannon散度（JSD）计算可靠性权重；使用类似链式思维推理的区域感知提示，融合一致性权重指导的区域响应。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多个LVLMs和基准测试上，MRFD显著减少了幻觉现象，并在无需模型更新的情况下改进响应的事实性。

Conclusion: MRFD方法能够有效减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象，显著提高响应的事实性，同时不需要进行额外的模型更新。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 摘要探讨了针对头部姿势变化的注视点估计问题，提出一种动态校准策略，改进估计的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前注视点估计器难以跨个体泛化且对头部姿势变化敏感，需要一种鲁棒的校准策略。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准，系统分析校准点和头部姿势多样性对估计精度的影响，根据结果提出动态校准策略，用户在移动手机时注视校准点。

Result: 实验表明动态校准策略通过引入头部姿势变化，有效提升了估计器对姿势变化的适应能力。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略在简化用户操作的同时显著降低了估计器对头部姿势变化的敏感性，是一种更优的校准方法。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Conclusion: 方法显示了生成语义清晰、结构完整图像的强大能力，为文本图像联合建模与图像生成提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种用于花样滑冰跳跃动作的方法，包括创建3D姿态数据集FS-Jump3D，进行视角不变的对比学习预训练和动作分类微调，最终实验验证其在有限数据情况下的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前花样滑冰动作分析需专家知识，数据不足且现有方法不能处理动作的三维特性及程序性结构。目标是提供准确评价运动员表现的自动化方法。

Method: 基于Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS)，提出视角不变的花样滑冰姿态表示学习方法（VIFSS）。创新包括使用新数据集FS-Jump3D进行对比学习预训练，并引入精细化标注区分“起跳”和“落地”阶段。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了花样滑冰跳跃动作分析的准确性，尤其体现了在数据有限时的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于相位一致性的加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）亚像素模板匹配方法，用于提高多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态光学图像因光谱响应差异导致的非线性辐射和几何变形问题，提升图像匹配的精度。

Method: 该方法分为粗匹配和精匹配两步。粗匹配利用结构相似性指数测量（SSIM），通过保留原始的结构细节进行模板匹配；精匹配则基于粗匹配结果，采用辐射和几何变换模型进行模板匹配，同时引入互结构滤波缓解噪声对结构一致性的影响，使用WLAD准则估算亚像素偏移量。

Result: 在可见光到红外Landsat图像、可见光到近红外近距离图像、以及可见光到红外无人机图像三类数据集上测试，PCWLAD在正确匹配率（CMR）和均方根误差（RMSE）指标均优于现有方法，平均匹配精度达到约0.4像素。

Conclusion: 提出的PCWLAD方法显著提升了多模态光学图像匹配的精度，并得到了实际数据验证，论文提供了公开代码和数据集可供研究者进一步使用。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

TL;DR: InterSyn引入交错学习，生成更自然、动态的多人物交互动作，显著提升文本到动作的对齐性与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时处理单人和多人交互动作的动态关系，难以生成自然协调的交互动作。

Method: 提出InterSyn框架，包含两个模块：交错交互合成模块（INS）从第一人称统一建模单人和多人行为；相对协调优化模块（REC）优化人物之间的动态和同步性。

Result: 实验结果显示，InterSyn生成的动作在文本对齐性和多样性上明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn改进了动作合成的自然性与鲁棒性，将开放源码以推动该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Conclusion: 文章分析了OoD分割的当前挑战，强调了自动驾驶中的重要性，并提出未来研究方向。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Result: RL提升了生成任务中的可控性、一致性，并更好地对齐人类需求。

Conclusion: 强化学习在生成模型中有巨大的潜力，但仍存在挑战，未来将致力于进一步探索RL与生成建模的结合方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在指令选择中，需要在获取概念知识与视觉技能之间进行权衡的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算病理学结合深度学习在肾小球超微结构自动分析中的潜力巨大，但现有研究主要专注于单一超微结构的识别，无法满足实际诊断需求。

Method: 该研究提出了基于三种深度学习模型（超微结构分割模型、肾小球滤过屏障区域分类模型和电子致密物检测模型）的框架（Glo-DMU），用于同时量化三种常用的超微结构特征：肾小球基底膜厚度、足突消失程度和电子致密物位置。

Conclusion: Glo-DMU具备全自动、高精度和高通量的特点，可同时量化多种超微结构特征，为肾脏病理学家提供了高效的辅助工具。

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Motivation: 现有方法难以区分和建模STEM数据中的空间漂移和辐射损伤，同时存在几何和强度的复杂失真问题。

Method: 提出一种名为AtomDiffuser的框架，通过预测仿射变换和空间衰减图来分离任何两帧之间的降解因素。

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser为STEM数据的时间分辨分析提供了一种高效工具，有助于对原子结构和辐射效应的可视化和量化分析。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新框架探讨VLMs的视觉灵敏度，并揭示了它们在视觉表征与人类感知间存在的关键差距。

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 训练大型图像生成模型可合成高质量图像，但通常会由于缺乏基础结构和空间布局信息而生成不一致或失真图像。本文提出了一种利用场景内在属性（如深度、分割图）的方法，共同生成图像及其内在属性以提高一致性和现实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型依赖于图像-文本对或条件输入，但无法有效捕捉场景的基础结构和空间布局，因此需要新的方法来生成更加一致和现实的图像。

Method: 通过预训练估测器从大规模图像数据中提取场景内在属性，并通过自动编码器将其整合为单一潜变量，结合预训练的Latent Diffusion Models（LDMs）同时对图像和其对应的内在属性进行去噪，从而提升生成图像的空间一致性和自然布局。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效改正了空间不一致性，生成了更加自然布局的图像，同时保持了基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的图像质量和文本对齐度。

Conclusion: 基于场景内在属性的图像生成方法可以改进现有模型的效果，生成视觉更一致且结构更加自然的高质量图像。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

TL;DR: 该研究提出NSegment+框架，通过分离图片与标签的变换，解决语义分割中的隐性标签噪声问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分割研究主要针对显性标签噪声，而现实世界数据也存在隐性标签缺陷，例如边界模糊和标注者差异，这对模型表现造成负面影响。

Method: 设计了NSegment+框架，该方法通过仅对标注标签进行弹性变形，而保持原始图像不变，帮助模型在标签细微不一致情况下学习到稳健的对象结构表示。

Result: 在Vaihingen、LoveDA、Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC数据集上平均分别获得了+2.29、+2.38、+1.75和+3.39的mIoU提升，且结合CutMix和标签平滑等训练技巧时效果更佳。

Conclusion: NSegment+显著改善了模型对隐性标签噪声的鲁棒性，展示了解决隐形标签噪声的重要性。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Motivation: 现有驾驶员分心检测模型在实际场景中普遍面临泛化能力下降的问题，主要是由于高数据标注成本和训练数据与目标部署环境之间的领域差异造成。

Method: 提出Pose驱动的质量控制数据增强框架（PQ-DAF），通过渐进条件扩散模型（PCDMs）获取驾驶员的关键姿势特征，生成多样化样本；并引入基于CogVLM视觉-语言模型的样本质量评估模块筛选低质量合成样本。

Conclusion: 该框架通过高效扩展训练数据和增强跨领域鲁棒性，为实际应用中的驾驶员分心检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving

### [29] [Translation of Text Embedding via Delta Vector to Suppress Strongly Entangled Content in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10407)
*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法解决文本到图像扩散模型中嵌套内容难以抑制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的文本到图像扩散模型在生成与文本提示相关的高质量图片时，无法有效抑制与特定词语强烈耦合的内容，如明确排除"胡子"时仍会出现在"查理·卓别林"生成图像中。

Method: 提出使用Delta向量直接修改文本嵌入空间来减弱不需要内容的影响，并通过零样本方法获得Delta向量。另外，提出了一个选择性压制机制(SSDV)将Delta向量融入交叉注意力机制，更精确抑制不需要的内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，本文方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种高效且创新的方法，通过Delta向量优化文本到图像模型的生成能力，为个人化模型提供更精确的内容控制。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新型的坡度感知和时间一致的3D车道检测框架，显著提升了高度估计和3D车道检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D车道检测方法在处理多样化坡度地形时鲁棒性不足，难以在实际驾驶场景中保持稳定高度估计。

Method: 提出SC-Lane框架，包括一个坡度自适应特征模块，通过动态预测图像特征整合多坡度表现，以及一个高度一致性模块，确保跨帧稳定性。同时设计了标准评价指标用于量化性能。

Result: 在OpenLane基准上实验表明，SC-Lane显著提升了高度估计和3D车道检测性能，以64.3%的F1得分超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过创新的模块设计和严格的性能基准设定，为3D车道检测领域提供了新的技术进步，并奠定了未来研究标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: 研究提出了Nano Control Diffusion Transformer (NanoControl)，通过采用Flux作为骨干网络，实现仅微小的参数和计算量增加便可进行高效的可控文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DiTs的可控文本到图像生成大多依赖于为UNet设计的ControlNet范式，带来较大的参数和计算成本，该研究旨在减少这种开销。

Method: 提出了一种类似LoRA的控制模块以直接从条件输入学习控制信号，并引入KV-Context Augmentation机制以更高效融合条件特征。

Result: NanoControl在计算开销显著降低的同时，保持了高质量生成能力并具备更优的可控性。

Conclusion: NanoControl通过创新设计，实现了在控制方法上的效率领先，同时在参数和资源消耗上具备显著优势，是可控文本到图像生成领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: 本论文提出STRIDE-QA，一个用于自我中心视角物理推理的视听问答数据集，针对视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中时空推理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型(VLMs)无法满足自动驾驶中动态交通场景的精准时空推理需求，需要开发新的工具来弥补这一不足。

Method: 通过在东京实际驾驶条件下收集100小时多传感数据，创建了包含16百万问答数据对的STRIDE-QA数据集，并加入密集的自动化标注与三类新颖任务以支持空间定位及时间预测推理。

Result: 经过在STRIDE-QA数据集上的微调，视觉-语言模型在空间定位和未来运动预测任务中分别取得了显著性能提升（55%和28%），相比普通模型表现更优异。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA数据集为开发更可靠的面向安全关键自动驾驶视觉-语言模型奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Conclusion: 通過DOD-SA框架成功達到僅需單模態標註的紅外可見光解耦目標檢測，提供了一種降低標註成本且性能卓越的解決方案。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Method: 设计了一种模仿视网膜-V1皮层的结构PerceptNet，针对自动编码、去噪、去模糊和稀疏正则化等图像重建任务进行端到端优化，并分析模型输出与人类感知的相关性。

Result: 编码器阶段（类似V1层）在图像失真评估上与人类感知高度相关，尤其在中度噪声、模糊和稀疏条件下效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，人类视觉系统可能针对特定失真和稀疏性进行了优化，且无需人工监督的生物启发模型可以学习到感知度量方法。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线视频超分辨仅使用单帧邻近框进行时间对齐，限制了长时间序列建模的能力，因此需要一种新方法以提升性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出的TS-Mamba利用轨迹感知选择最相似的Token，然后通过基于Hilbert扫描和相应Shift操作设计的Shifted SSMs块来聚合这些Token。同时，提出轨迹感知损失函数监督轨迹生成。

Result: 实验表明，与六种在线VSR基准模型相比，TS-Mamba在多数情况下达到了最先进的性能，并实现了22.7%以上的复杂度降低（以MACs计）。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba在在线视频超分辨任务中表现出了卓越的表现及效率，是一种极具潜力的解决方案。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Conclusion: 域随机化与AE质量控制结合能有效实现极少标注条件下的半监督分割，减轻标注负担。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前 STAS 的大规模诊断依赖于手工操作，存在易被忽视和误诊的风险，因此迫切需要通过深度学习模型提高诊断效率。

Method: 收集并标准化多个医学中心的病理影像数据，使用多模式注意力感知的多实例学习框架（STAMP），结合 transformer 编码与注意力汇聚模块，实现对 STAS 的高效诊断。

Result: STAMP 模型在 STAS 数据集上的 AUC 分别达到了 0.8058, 0.8017 和 0.7928，表现优于现有的临床诊断水平。

Conclusion: STAMP 模型通过改进的架构显著提高了 STAS 的诊断效率和准确性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

Conclusion: TweezeEdit表现出快速、高效及高保真语义保留的能力，显示了其实时应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Motivation: 当前3D高斯点采在实时新视图合成中虽有进步，但优化过程中的几何约束不足导致高频细节的模糊重建，需开发更有效的处理方法。

Method: 提出通过多样本抗锯齿(MSAA)结合动态梯度分析和几何正则约束优化，分别减小影响高频纹理的混叠伪影和提高在边界处的几何一致性。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中表现出了最新的性能，尤其在高频细节（如高频纹理和锐利不连续性）的保留方面有显著改进，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: 该方法优先优化关键区域的计算资源分配，达到了保持全局一致性的同时提升细节恢复的目标，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Motivation: 光学遥感图像显著目标检测存在目标尺度变化显著、目标与背景对比度低的问题，现有方法难以高效整合全局和局部特征。

Method: 提出了一种基于Mamba架构的GCRPNet模型。使用VSS编码器提取多尺度特征，引入差异-相似引导的层次图注意模块（DS-HGAM）和LEVSS解码块以增强特征的交互能力和局部建模能力。

Result: 提出的GCRPNet模型通过实验验证实现了当前最新的性能表现，证明了其有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 通过捕捉长距离依赖关系和增强局部特征，GCRPNet在遥感图像显著目标检测任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Motivation: 多视网膜疾病的筛查依赖于完全标注的数据集，但多数据集间的域转换与部分类别标签缺失的问题使得方法开发具有挑战性。

Method: 设计双流模型，一个学习确定性特征，另一个通过注入不确定性学习概率特征。利用文本引导解耦和对齐这些特征，结合伪标签一致性和自蒸馏技术强化检测性能。

Conclusion: PSScreen解决了部分标注数据集的两大挑战，不仅提升了检测能力，还表明在跨域推广中的优越性。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP)的新方法，通过检索外部知识增强视觉语言模型的提示，实现更好的OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因使用有限且与真实测试样本不匹配的outliers，无法提供足够的语义监督，从而表现欠佳。

Method: 通过检索外部文本知识，提取对outliers的描述性词语来增强OOD检测提示，训练中加入这些语义信息，测试中动态更新提示以快速适应环境。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k等多个OOD检测基准数据集上取得了同比最优的性能，例如1-shot检测中FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提升1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP方法通过动态提示增强以及外部知识的融入，有效改进了OOD检测的语义能力和实际性能。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决PTQ导致量化模型性能严重下降和QAT在资源需求与时间上的高昂代价之间的平衡问题。

Method: 核心方法是在网络中选择关键层用于QAT微调，其余层采用PTQ；微调时优先选择量化前后输出差异较小的层以减少误差传播。

Result: PTQAT在保持与QAT相似性能的前提下，大幅提升效率，实验在nuScenes数据集的多种3D感知任务中优于QAT-only基线模型。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效、通用的量化方法，支持多种量化位宽和模型架构；在减少微调权重的情况下，显著提升量化模型性能。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Conclusion: HM-Talker框架通过混合运动建模和融合模块，有效缓解面部运动模糊和唇部抖动的技术瓶颈，推动了个性化说话人头像生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,
Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on
a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at:

*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于多模态线索的视频目标分割问题，提出了一种灵活和自适应的多模态代理系统，实现了在多模态条件下的目标分割任务上的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决传统方法在多模态视频对象分割中高计算复杂性和手动标注成本的难题，同时利用近期视觉-语言基础模型的进展以探索免训练的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为多模态代理（Multi-Modal Agent）的新系统，它利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力生成动态工作流，并通过一组设计用于完成不同模态低层次任务的工具迭代性地解决目标分割问题。

Result: 在两个多模态条件视频对象分割任务（RVOS 和 Ref-AVS）上体现了该代理系统相较于先前方法的显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态代理系统通过大语言模型和工具的交互，自适应地解决了多模态线索引导的视频目标分割任务，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究推出了HumanSense，一个用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在以人为中心的感知与互动能力的基准，并提出通过多阶段、跨模态强化学习提升模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前MLLMs在处理复杂的人类互动场景中存在不足，缺乏细致的评估框架来验证其在人类意图理解及情境感知反应中的表现。

Method: 提出HumanSense基准，用于多模态上下文中细化评估；设计多阶段的跨模态强化学习方法增强推理能力；通过设计特定提示词在无需额外训练的情况下提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，结合视觉、音频及文本信息的输入显著改善了模型的性能；而多模态模型在复杂任务中展现出优势；强化学习策略显著提升推理能力，提示设计也能提升非推理模型的表现。

Conclusion: MLLMs在深度人类交互场景中仍具发展空间，推理能力是准确反馈的关键，通过强化学习和设计相应提示可有效提升模型能力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: 提出了一种旨在减少湍流失真的新型框架，利用高频事件流分离模糊和倾斜效应，并展示了比现有先进方法更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的单图像和多帧方法难以解决由于湍流引起的模糊和几何倾斜失真，且这种问题的复合性使其高度不适定。

Method: 提出EvTurb框架，使用高频事件流建模湍流，分离模糊和倾斜效应，并引入两步事件引导网络来实现去除失真。此外，开发了TurbEvent真实湍流数据集。

Result: 实验表明EvTurb在计算效率的同时，性能优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: EvTurb通过针对性解决湍流影响的问题，为计算机视觉任务提供了一种高效而有效的新方法。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了P$^3$A框架，专注于高分辨率数据集下对2D目标检测系统的黑盒对抗性攻击，解决了以往方法评估过于乐观以及迁移性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学习型自动驾驶系统在面对高分辨率数据时的对抗性攻击效果低下和评估标准过于乐观的问题，同时提高攻击的实际迁移能力与安全风险评估精准性。

Method: 提出了Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR)指标用于评估攻击效果；设计了Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL)以提升在PASR下的迁移性；引入了Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP)作为数据预处理步骤以增强在高分辨率数据集的效果。

Result: 实验表明，P$^3$A在未见过的模型和高分辨率数据集上表现优越，在提出的实际IoU评估指标和传统mAP评估指标下均有更高效果。

Conclusion: P$^3$A框架显著提高了黑盒对抗性攻击在高分辨率自动驾驶数据集上的迁移性与攻防效果，为未来研究高效、实用的自动驾驶系统安全攻击提供了一种新范式。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的上采样模块FGA，用于单图像超分辨率，能够有效减少混叠伪影并增强高频细节重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法容易在重构高频细节时失败并引入混叠伪影，因此需要一种能够更好处理高频细节的改进方法。

Method: FGA模块包含：(1)基于傅里叶特征的多层感知机进行频率编码，(2)跨分辨率的相关注意力层实现自适应空间对齐，(3)基于频域的L1损失进行光谱一致性监督。

Result: 在增加0.3M参数的情况下，FGA在五种不同的超分辨率模型中一贯提升性能，平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，并提高频域一致性高达29%。在纹理丰富的数据集上效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: FGA在减少混叠和保留细节方面显示了优势，是传统上采样方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FIND-Net的新型神经网络，用于金属伪影抑制，结合空间和频率域处理以实现性能提升，并在实验中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习算法尽管在金属伪影抑制方面取得了一定成功，但难以同时抑制伪影和保留结构细节。为此，提出一种结合空间和频率域的新方法。

Method: 提出的FIND-Net框架结合了快速傅里叶卷积(FFC)层和可训练的高斯滤波，将金属伪影抑制视为在空间和频率域中的混合任务进行处理，以增强全局上下文理解和频率选择性。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net表现出显著改进，包括3.07%的MAE降低、0.18%的SSIM提高和0.90%的PSNR提升。在真实临床CT扫描中也验证了其在抑制伪影的同时最小化对干净解剖区的修改能力。

Conclusion: FIND-Net通过结合频率和空间处理克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了更好的结构保留和伪影抑制，为金属伪影抑制问题提供了具备优越性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了Chamfer Guidance方法，通过少量真实样本提升条件图像生成模型的多样性和质量，同时将生成多样性和真实数据的分布更好地对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在提升质量时往往损害了生成多样性，限制了其作为合成训练数据源的能力。同时，现有引导方法忽视了真实数据和合成数据之间的分布偏差问题，影响优化效果。

Method: 提出Chamfer Guidance，这是一种无需训练的引导方法，通过少量（如2-32幅）真实样本图像，评估合成数据的质量和多样性以进行优化。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和地理多样性基准测试中提升生成多样性，并实现96.4%/86.4%（2样本条件下）和97.5%/92.7%（32样本条件下）的精度和分布覆盖率。与基线相比，分类器准确率改进了最高达15%（分布内）和16%（分布外）。另外，计算时间减少了31%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance在无需使用未条件模型的情况下，通过少量无标签样本实现了生成质量和多样性的平衡，并提升了下游任务效果和计算效率。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV是一个新的互动视觉语言模型（VLM），可以联合分析卫星图像和传感器数据，为环境监测提供有力支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VLM模型未能充分利用环境传感器的因果信息，语言描述有偏，以及缺乏互动情景推理能力。

Method: 创建了一个包含17.7万张图像的多时段配对数据集，结合传感器元数据进行标注，并通过LoRA方法微调Qwen-2.5-VL模型，使其支持聊天互动。

Result: ChatENV在时序推理及假设分析方面表现优越，BERT-F1达到0.903，能够与最先进时序模型媲美或超越，同时支持互动情景分析。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一款功能强大的工具，具备以传感器为基础的环境监测能力，填补了当前VLM的多项不足。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 分析图像采集和处理过程中的参数，研究其对视觉编码器生成的语义预测的影响，特别是在标签与参数间存在强相关或反相关的情况下。

Result: 发现图像采集和处理参数会被编码器学习并恢复，这些参数对语义预测造成显著正面或负面影响，具体取决于标签之间的相关性。

Conclusion: 细微的图像获取与处理参数对视觉编码器影响深远，揭示了其在图像表示学习中的重要性，研究结果强调了进一步研究视觉表征敏感性的必要性。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Conclusion: SemPT通过捕捉可迁移的语义线索，成功实现了在已见和未见类别之间的有效适应，显著提升了视觉迁移学习的表现。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

TL;DR: 本文通过提出一个统一的测试基准UniBench300解决了现有多模态视觉目标跟踪（MMVOT）任务中因数据分离导致的训练与测试不一致性问题，并利用持续学习（CL）理念改进了任务统一过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态视觉目标跟踪任务存在训练与测试间不一致性的问题，导致性能下降，同时尚缺乏一个统一的基准来评估所有模态的数据。

Method: 提出了一个统一基准UniBench300，将多任务数据整合为一，同时将任务统一过程改革为序列化格式，并引入持续学习（CL）来解决因任务整合导致的知识遗忘问题。

Result: 实验表明，UniBench300显著减少了推理时间（减少27%），同时引入持续学习能够支持稳定的统一过程。分析发现，性能下降与网络容量负相关，同时模态差异导致了不同任务上的性能下降程度（RGBT > RGBD > RGBE）。

Conclusion: UniBench300作为一项统一基准显著改善了训练和测试过程中的一致性问题，通过持续学习辅助的序列化整合方法进一步优化了任务统一过程，为未来的多模态视觉研究提供了有价值的洞见。

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Result: 实验结果显示，AddressVLM在两个街道视图数据集上的平均地址定位准确率分别超过对比模型9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过整合卫星与街景视图成功提升了大型视觉语言模型在细粒度地址问题上的定位精度，证明了融合宏观与微观视觉线索的重要性，且实验结果验证了模型的优越性能。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建一个高质量的人脸数据集，以提升人脸识别模型性能，并遵守挑战要求，即数据集中身份不得与现有公共人脸数据集重叠。

Method: 对原始数据集进行严格清理，结合面嵌入聚类和GPT-4o协助进行身份验证，并生成合成身份（使用Stable Diffusion和Vec2Face相结合），最终构建混合式高质量数据集。使用课程学习策略进行模型训练。

Result: 最终数据集包括每个身份50张图片，并且通过验证确保没有身份泄漏。该方法在挑战中获得第一名，实验表明数据集提升了模型在不同身份规模下的性能。

Conclusion: 论文展示了通过混合生成和数据清理构建优质人脸数据集的有效方法，对提升人脸识别模型效果有显著帮助。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTea模型，通过结合全局和局部时间视角，加强MIRSTD中小目标检测的多时间尺度特征表示，并首次在该领域中整合CNN、RNN和HGNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于运动红外小目标具有“小尺寸、弱强度、复杂运动模式”等挑战，现有方法通常只进行低阶相关性建模和单一时间尺度特征提取，在MIRSTD领域仍存在局限性。

Method: 提出HyperTea模型，包括三个模块：全局时间增强模块（GTEM），局部时间增强模块（LTEM），以及时间对齐模块（TAM），实现特征的高阶时空相关性建模及时间上下文的增强。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上实验显示，HyperTea取得SOTA的检测性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea模型综合了CNN、RNN和HGNN，显著提高了运动红外小目标检测的效果，并提供了开源代码供研究者使用。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于胎儿MRI的T2映射面临挑战，如成像时间长、对运动敏感，高分辨率重建难实现。需有效方法改善中场强（0.55T）MRI的T2映射。

Method: 使用联合重建方法，结合基于物理的正则化建模T2衰减，采用隐式神经表示实现跨TE信息共享，并保留解剖结构和定量T2精度。

Result: 在模拟胎儿大脑和成人（有类似胎儿运动）数据集上，展示了国际领先性能；并首次实现了0.55T下原位胎儿T2映射。

Conclusion: 该方法有望减少T2映射每TE需要的图像堆叠数，通过利用解剖冗余提高成像效率，与胎儿脑部MRI的定量测量具有广泛潜能。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Conclusion: IADGPT能够以人类方式完成工业异常检测任务，未来将通过开放数据集进一步推动领域发展。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多方法需要微调大型扩散模型或从头训练，代价昂贵，且存在重建模糊和泛化性能差的问题。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型的生成能力，通过摄像机位姿条件设计了一个转换U-Net（TUNet）；并提出了一种融合策略利用DDIM反演过程中的噪声相关结构来保留细节。

Result: 在MVImgNet数据集上实验表明，该方法在生成新视角图像任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持几何一致性和细节重建的同时，能够高效生成新视角图像，证明其优越性。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为MCFNet的网络，通过融合事件相机和RGB相机的信息，提升在复杂交通环境下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机的动态范围限制导致复杂交通环境下图像对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测的性能，需寻找增强解决方案。

Method: 引入生物启发的事件相机与RGB相机，设计MCFNet网络，通过时间对齐、动态上采样和适配的跨模态特征融合实现高效目标检测。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上验证了MCFNet的有效性，相较于现有方法在不同恶劣光照和快速移动场景下显著提升检测性能，DSEC-Det数据集的mAP50提高了7.4%，mAP提高了1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过创新性的模块设计和方法改进，有效解决复杂环境中的目标检测问题，为类似场景下的图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“CountCluster”的方法，以提高文本到图像生成模型对指定物体数量的准确反映能力，显著改善现有方法的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型在生成指定数量物体的能力方面表现欠佳。这主要是因为物体数量通常在去噪过程的早期阶段确定，而现有方法未能有效利用这一特性。

Method: 本文提出了“CountCluster”方法，通过对生成过程中早期的物体交叉注意力图进行聚类，使其符合输入中指定的物体数量，并以目标分布为指导优化潜变量，而无需借助外部工具或额外训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，CountCluster在物体数量准确性方面平均提升了18.5个百分点，且在多种提示词下表现出色。

Conclusion: CountCluster方法通过有效控制图像中的物体数量，提高了生成模型的数量控制能力，展示了较强的通用性与实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要从高维输入和噪声奖励中学习感知和动作，而如何有效整合大型感知模型提升视觉泛化和样本效率尚不明确。

Method: 提出SegDAC方法，结合SAM进行对象分解，使用YOLO-World通过文本提示进行语义化，同时设计了一种支持动态分割变更的基于Transformer的架构，无需人工标签即可在线学习关注的片段。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中验证，SegDAC在视觉泛化和样本效率上表现出色，在最困难设置下性能翻倍，并在所有任务中匹敌甚至超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC实现了视觉强化学习中的显著改进，提供了增强视觉泛化和样本效率的新方法。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的离散令牌生成方法存在无法充分利用代码簿中令牌相似性信息的问题，导致生成模型性能受限。

Method: 提出Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE)，采用基于实例的距离代替传统质心距离，并采用聚合合并技术优化令牌分布的处理。

Result: DCPE方法加快了autoregressive模型的训练速度（提高42%），并提升了生成质量（更低的FID和更高的IS得分）。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的工具，可在现有代码簿先验框架中直接应用，带来了显著的训练加速和生成性能提升。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

TL;DR: 提出一个新框架ConGCD，通过分解和重构视觉特征来增强新旧类别对象识别的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的广义类别发现方法过于集中于优化目标函数，无法完全复现人类认知系统的能力。

Method: 通过高层语义重构建立面向原语的表示，使用分解方法绑定类内共享属性，并引入以人类认知为灵感的显性和背景共识单元，以捕获类别判别特征和固有分布不变量。

Result: 在粗粒度和细粒度基准测试中表现优异，证明了其作为共识感知范式的有效性。

Conclusion: ConGCD通过模拟人类视觉处理过程，提出了一种新的类别发现方法，提升了对新旧类别对象的理解能力。

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Result: 方法在对称轴检测任务中达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了对反射和旋转对称性检测的精确度，为复杂场景的对称检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法缺乏对未知伪造技术的泛化能力，而深度伪造技术更新迅速，迫切需要开发具备强泛化能力的检测技术。

Method: 提出了一种伪造引导学习（FGL）策略，通过捕捉已知和未知伪造技术的差异信息，动态调整检测网络的学习过程。此外，设计了双感知网络（DPNet），通过频率和空间特征来捕捉伪造痕迹的差异与关系，并使用图卷积处理特征间的关系。

Conclusion: FGL策略和DPNet模型能够有效提升深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和跨领域能力，为解决未知伪造技术难题提供了强有力支持。

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前数据驱动的配准方法在分组环境中不具通用性，而模型驱动方法尽管更高效但存在可扩展性和优化挑战。这论文的动机是开发一个既高效又普适的分组配准框架。

Method: 本研究引入了一种基于差异同胚映射的新的图谱构建方法DARC，结合协同下降策略和中心性激活函数进行分组配准。

Result: DARC 能够高效处理大规模三维图像，产生高保真解剖图谱，并在单次分割和形状合成应用中超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: DARC 提供了一种灵活的、具有普适性和资源效率的图谱构建框架，适用于多种医学图像分析任务。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言模型在时空物理推理这一关键任务中的表现和不足，推动构建稳健的世界模型。

Method: 结合监督微调和基于规则的强化学习技术对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行改进。

Result: 改进后模型的时空物理推理能力显著提升，优于现有领先的专有模型，但在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍然有限。

Conclusion: 当前模型在时空物理推理上的局限性仍然突出，需要研发新的方法来增强其泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Conclusion: AEGIS是一个重要的评估基准，推动了视频真实性检测方法的发展，有助于应对现实中的伪造威胁，并支持更多相关研究领域的进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is
available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/Clarifiedfish/AEGIS.

Method: 引入自适应块稀疏注意力机制（ASA）以动态生成稀疏性掩码，聚焦计算于重要的时空特征；同时提出基于轨迹分布匹配的稀疏感知蒸馏方法，将稀疏性直接纳入蒸馏过程中，加速收敛。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B上显著提升推理速度，分别实现8.89x和14.10x加速，且在视频质量（VBench-2.0基准评分及人工评估）上也有所提升。

Conclusion: BLADE框架在显著提升推理效率的同时，还增强了生成质量，提供了一种高效且质量稳定的文本到视频生成解决方案，代码和模型公开可用。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的参考超分辨率方法在LR图像与HR参考图像信息对齐方面存在局限性。同时，当前的RefSR数据集分辨率有限，参考图像缺乏足够的细节支持高质量恢复。

Method: 提出TriFlowSR框架，通过设计参考匹配策略（Reference Matching Strategy）实现LR图像与HR参考图像的有效匹配。此外，引入Landmark-4K数据集，用于超高清（UHD）地标场景的研究。

Result: 实验结果显示，TriFlowSR相比现有方法能更好地利用HR参考图像的语义和纹理信息，特别是在真实世界退化场景中的超高清任务中表现优秀。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR框架为超高清地标场景的图像超分辨率任务提供了新的思路，并验证了其在真实场景中的优越性。这是第一个针对超高清地标情景设计的基于扩散的RefSR方法。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

Method: 提出了一种名为VasoMIM的新框架，包括解剖引导的遮掩策略和解剖一致性损失两部分，前者通过优先遮掩含有血管的区域来改善模型学习能力，后者通过增强原始图像与重建图像在血管语义上的一致性来提升血管特征区分性。

Result: 该方法在三个数据集上取得了最先进的性能，显著改善了血管分割的表现。

Conclusion: 实验证明，VasoMIM具备提升X射线血管造影分析的潜力，可广泛应用于相关的临床任务中。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

EfficientNet-B0, B1 - specifically chosen for their efficiency on
resource-constrained devices. The results were promising, with EfficientNet-B1
delivering our best performance at 94.7% classification accuracy. This
architecture struck an optimal balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world deployment on mobile devices.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对比学习框架BaCon-Stereo，解决自监督立体匹配在遮挡区域的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的自监督立体匹配由于依赖于光度一致性假设，在遮挡区域表现不佳。

Method: 使用教师-学生范式，结合多基线输入，教师预测用于监督学生，并引入遮挡感知注意力图结合生成的多基线数据集BaCon-20k进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，BaCon-Stereo在遮挡和非遮挡区域均有显著提升，具有较强的泛化性和鲁棒性，在KITTI 2015和2012基准上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo在有效解决遮挡问题的基础上，提升了自监督立体匹配的性能，并具有未来广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量视频生成虽然视觉效果显著，但在生成符合物理规律方面仍存在挑战，尤其是对于强调真实感和精确性的应用。

Method: 研究提出了PhysHPO框架，从实例、状态、运动和语义四个层次进行视频对齐优化，同时通过自动数据选择管道从现有数据集中高效获取优质数据。

Result: 实验表明，PhysHPO显著提高了视频生成的物理合理性和整体质量。

Conclusion: PhysHPO首次探讨了视频生成中细粒度的偏好对齐和数据选择方法，为生成更具现实性和人类偏好的视频奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT模型在脑部肿瘤磁共振成像（MRI）视觉问答中的表现，其中GPT-5-mini表现最佳，但整体准确度仍不足以支持临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型在视觉问答任务中的能力，具体应用于脑肿瘤的分类与诊断，以改进神经肿瘤学中的治疗规划。

Method: 采用脑肿瘤视觉问答测试集，输入多序列MRI图像与临床特征，评估了GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5的零样本链式推理准确性。

Result: GPT-5-mini的宏平均准确率最高（44.19%），依次为GPT-5（43.71%）、GPT-4o（41.49%）、GPT-5-nano（35.85%）。

Conclusion: GPT模型在神经肿瘤学诊断任务上有一定准确性潜力，但未达到可用于临床的水平。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer通过统一动画中间帧和上色的阶段，基于生成模型化繁为简，提升制作效率和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前动画制作中的中间帧绘制和上色手段通常分开处理，导致错误累积和效果欠佳，该方法旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ToonComposer采用稀疏草图注入机制结合空间低秩适配器，统一动画中间帧和上色任务，利用单个草图和参考框架即可实现高效操作。

Result: 实验引入人绘草图的PKBench数据集，并表明ToonComposer在视觉质量、动态一致性及生产效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为卡通制作提供了一种高效灵活的AI辅助方案，大幅减少了人工工作量并提升了艺术表现力。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法要么依赖于昂贵的全局优化，要么使用简单记忆机制，难以扩展到长序列，难以应对动态场景的挑战。

Method: STream3R使用因果注意力机制，基于Transformer架构的流式框架，能够从大规模3D数据集中学习几何先验，同时支持与大规模语言模型的训练基础设施兼容。

Result: 实验证明，在静态和动态场景基准测试中，STream3R均优于现有方法，展现了实时3D感知能力。

Conclusion: STream3R展现了因果Transformer模型用于在线3D感知的潜力，为流媒体环境中的实时3D理解铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Conclusion: MAESTRO能够有效处理多模态、多时态和多光谱的地球观测数据，有助于提升相关任务的表现。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种视频类别增量学习(VCIL)的新方法ESSENTIAL，同时利用情景记忆和语义记忆来提高性能和记忆效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在应对VCIL问题时要么牺牲记忆效率，要么牺牲关键的时间信息，需平衡两者以提升性能。

Method: 作者提出ESSENTIAL方法，结合情景记忆和语义记忆。情景记忆存储稀疏的时间特征，语义记忆保存通过可学习提示表示的一般知识，并通过跨注意力模块实现两种记忆的有效集成。

Result: ESSENTIAL模型在UCF-101、HMDB51等多个基准数据集上进行了验证，展示了显著减少记忆需求情况下仍能取得优异性能。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL在提升VCIL性能与记忆效率之间取得了良好平衡，为未来的VCIL研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的跨领域模型依赖领域特定的组件和多阶段训练，这限制了其实用性和扩展性。作者希望开发一种单一过程训练的统一模型，消除上述限制。

Method: 提出了Pose-in-Context (PiC)和HiC的模型，后者在前者的基础上扩展了模态、任务和数据集的广度，并引入了最大-最小相似性提示采样策略，以及双分支上下文注入的网络架构。

Result: 实验表明，与PiC相比，HiC在广泛领域中的泛化能力、数据规模和性能方面表现更优。

Conclusion: HiC模型证明了统一跨领域3D人类运动建模的潜力，并在灵活性和扩展性方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了Puppeteer框架，实现了3D内容的自动绑定和动画生成，实现更高效的工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前静态3D模型转化为动态动画资产仍需大量人工操作，形成瓶颈，而生成式AI已有突破但在绑定与动画仍需专家辅助。

Method: Puppeteer采用自回归Transformer进行骨架预测，结合基于注意力机制的架构推导蒙皮权重，并引入一种基于优化的动画生成流程，提供计算效率和高保真视觉效果。

Result: 通过多项基准测试表明，该方法在骨架预测准确性和蒙皮质量上显著优于现有技术，且能够消除抖动问题，生成稳定流畅动画。

Conclusion: Puppeteer是一种统一框架，解决了多样化3D对象的自动绑定与动画问题，实现了动态内容创作流程的自动化与高度效率化。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in

### [108] [Quantum Visual Fields with Neural Amplitude Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10900)
*Shuteng Wang,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的量子视觉场（QVF）模型，用于2D图像和3D几何场的学习，展示了卓越的性能优势和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子隐式神经表示法（QINR）中架构设计、量子特性的实用性、训练效率以及与经典模块交互的问题。

Method: 提出QVF模型，采用可学习的能量流形进行量子态矢量编码，使用全纠缠设计的参数化量子电路，并通过投影测量直接提取学习信号。

Result: QVF在量子硬件模拟器上的实验表现优于现有量子方法及流行的经典基线模型，在视觉表示的准确性和学习高频细节方面具有优势。

Conclusion: QVF模型在2D和3D场补全及3D形状插值等视觉任务中展现出潜力，推动了量子神经表示方法的进步。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现临床文档数据提取的自动化可以提高医疗效率，但部署NLP解决方案存在实际挑战。

Method: 采用以业务目标为导向、迭代开发以及跨学科协作的方法，结合混合或简单方法选择、关注数据质量与误差缓解策略等。

Result: 总结出多个实用性较强的见解，如基于问题定义、技术选择与质量控制方法的策略框架。

Conclusion: 此研究提出的实践考量能为医疗机构实施AI/NLP解决方案提供指导，有助于改进数据管理，提升患者护理与公共卫生水平。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于评估开源大型语言模型公平性的透明评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在高风险领域应用中的公平性问题，特别是在刑事司法、教育、医疗和金融领域的使用带来的担忧。

Method: 通过在ICP区块链上的智能合约执行进行公平性评估，包括将数据集、提示和指标存储在链上，并结合一系列基准和数据集（如PISA和StereoSet）使用统计公平性和社会偏见指标进行评估。

Result: 基于PISA、StereoSet和Kaleidoscope数据集，评估多个模型（如Llama，DeepSeek，Mistral），揭示了多语言场景中的跨语言偏差和社会偏见。

Conclusion: 方法创新且保持透明与可追溯性，所有代码和结果开源，便于社区审计及对模型版本的公平性进行长期追踪。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在填补教育领域中主题或内容分类研究的空白，尤其是对于K-12阶段的实际数据缺乏支持，并探索生成式AI在教育中的潜在应用。

Method: 采用分层分类方法按内容（如自然、人物）与任务（如写作、解释）对超过17,000条消息进行分析，结合先进的预处理技术和LLM指令以实现更符合人类对主题结构的分类效果。

Result: 研究得出一系列关于生成式AI在教育中的新应用，发现传统和新兴的方法在处理大规模文本分析时表现欠佳。而直接应用现代LLM结合明确指令，能够获得更具洞察力的分层主题结构。

Conclusion: 研究为生成式AI在教育中应用提供了丰富见解，同时提出了一些潜在领域的研究问题与挑战。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个名为INTIMA的基准，用于评估语言模型的陪伴行为，发现不同模型和商业提供商在敏感交互中的优先级存在显著差异，强调了标准化方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人们对人工智能情感陪伴的需求增加，研究提出需要标准化评估这些交互行为的方法，尤其是针对用户心理健康的潜在影响。

Method: 研究根据心理学理论和用户数据，构建了31种行为的分类学，并设计了368个针对性提示，通过评估模型响应婚行为属于增强陪伴、保持边界或中立类别来检测模型行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，不同模型在陪伴增强行为上存在显著差异，不同商业提供商在处理敏感交互时的优先级也呈现不同，暴露出缺乏一致性的问题。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在处理与情感相关的互动中需采用更一致的方法，以更好地实现兼顾用户福祉的目标。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Result: 分析表明XFacta能更好地评估多模态误导信息检测方法，同时有助于总结优化模型设计的实践方法。

Conclusion: XFacta推动了多模态误导信息检测领域的发展，为今后的研究提供了重要的工具和洞见。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在真实应用中文本分类模型因数据有限而表现欠佳的问题。

Method: 通过大型语言模型生成多样化的合成数据，并提出自动化工作流程，寻找生成更有效合成数据的输入示例。同时设计了三种搜索策略，并进一步开发了根据类别特征选择搜索策略的集成算法。

Result: 实验证明，集成算法比单一策略更能有效提升基于LLMs改进的分类模型性能。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs生成和优化合成数据是提升数据不足情况下分类模型性能的有效方式，集成搜索策略的自动化流程表现最佳。

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [116] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了低资源语言（如 Hinglish）中事实核查的问题，提出了新的数据集 HiFACT 和模型 HiFACTMix。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实核查系统主要集中在高资源的单一语言环境，难以应用于如印度这种语言多样的真实政治语境中。尤其是 Hinglish 的广泛使用使得开发强有力的、多语言并能理解上下文的事实核查工具变得必要。

Method: 提出了一个包含 1500 个事实声明的 HiFACT 数据集，并开发了 HiFACTMix 模型，结合多语言上下文编码、声明与证据语义对齐、证据图谱构建、图神经网络推理和自然语言解释生成等方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，HiFACTMix 模型在准确性上优于现有的多语言模型，并且对其核查结果提供了充分的解释。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建 HiFACT 数据集和 HiFACTMix 模型，为多语言、混合代码及政治相关的事实核查研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）的嵌入矩阵中的语义关联与人类的语义评分显示出相似的低维结构，并提出语义预测方向对人类评分的高相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型中语义关联的结构是否与人类语义评分的低维结构相似，以更好理解模型语义信息的组织方式。

Method: 使用反义词对（如“kind-cruel”）定义语义方向，投影单词并分析其与人类评分的相关性，进一步研究这些方向在LLM嵌入中的表现及语义特性之间的几何关系。

Result: 研究表明LLM中的语义方向映射高度相关于人类评分，并集中在接近于3维的子空间，揭示出LLM语义特性与人类语言相似的关联模式。此外，语义方向调节对相似特性的非预期影响与余弦相似度相关。

Conclusion: 语义特性在大型语言模型中呈现低维和纠缠特性，与人类语言的复杂性相呼应。理解这种语义结构对避免不良影响及模型使用中更精准的语义调控至关重要。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transformer模型中的注意力机制在医学文献分类中的解释能力，以及视觉化展示对其解释性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨注意力权重作为解释性工具在医学文献分类中的有效性，以及如何通过视觉化提高其实用性。

Method: 通过用户研究，邀请不同学科的医学专家评估注意力权重对分析医学文献的帮助，并比较不同的注意力可视化方法。

Result: 结果显示，Transformer模型（XLNet）分类表现准确，但注意力权重作为解释工具的感知帮助有限，这种感知帮助与可视化格式有关。

Conclusion: 尽管注意力权重的总体解释性尚未证实，但其可感知实用性与展示方式显著相关，直观的格式更受欢迎。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

TL;DR: 这篇文章探讨了使用大语言模型(LMI)自动评分AIHQ问卷开放性问题，以减少人类评分的时间消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AIHQ问卷的开放性问题需要耗时的人工评分，研究希望通过自动化方法提高效率并降低成本。

Method: 研究使用先前收集的TBI和HC数据集，通过微调大型语言模型（LMI），以匹配人工评分，并验证其在不同情景类型中的表现。

Result: 模型生成的评分与人工评分高度一致，且在不同类型情境中均表现稳定，一些模型还能很好泛化到其他数据集。

Conclusion: 结果表明，大语言模型能够有效辅助AIHQ评分，有潜力用作不同人群心理评估的工具，同时也提供了可供实践的评分界面。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Motivation: 在线讨论论坛需要不断更新，但LLM的频繁重训练成本太高，因此需要找到一个更经济的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种贝叶斯融合的方法，将预训练LLM的多维分类分数与本地数据训练的分类器的分数结合。

Result: 实验表明贝叶斯融合方法的表现优于单一分类器，并与LLM微调方法的效果相当。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种有效且成本更低的方法，适用于动态更新需求高的在线论坛内容管理。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Method: 提出一种名为S-MoE的模型，利用特殊的引导标记将任务路由到指定的专家网络，避免传统专家模型中训练门控函数的需求。

Result: 在语音到文本模型上，S-MoE实现了Word Error Rate (WER)的6.35%相对提升。

Conclusion: S-MoE通过分离任务网络的方式有效减少了任务干扰，提升了语音相关任务的多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

TL;DR: 此研究评估了基于大语言模型（LLMs）的生成式AI在日本注册营养师国家考试中的表现，结果显示部分模型略超过通过率，但表现仍不稳定，准确性及一致性需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在营养学教育中的潜力，特别是在日本注册营养师国家考试中的应用能力。

Method: 使用日本注册营养师国家考试的问题作为提示，分别测试ChatGPT和三个基于GPT-3.5及GPT-4的Bing模型的准确性、一致性及响应时间，并进行提示工程以评估效果提升。

Result: Bing-Precise（66.2%）和Bing-Creative（61.4%）超过通过率，而Bing-Balanced（43.3%）和ChatGPT（42.8%）未通过。所有模型在营养教育领域表现较差且一致性不足，提示工程提升有限。

Conclusion: 尽管部分模型表现优于通过率，但总体准确性和一致性不佳，生成式AI作为注册营养师考试的学习工具仍需改进。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

### [125] [Guided Navigation in Knowledge-Dense Environments: Structured Semantic Exploration with Guidance Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10012)
*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GG Explore，一个结合大语言模型（LLM）和知识图谱（KGs）的新框架，引入了指导图（Guidance Graph）以实现高效的知识检索和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的知识探索方法存在折中：基于问题的探索会造成冗余，基于线索的探索在复杂场景下难以利用上下文信息。

Method: 引入指导图（Guidance Graph）作为中间抽象层，通过定义检索空间实现结构抽象和语义上下文保留，同时设计了结构对齐和上下文感知剪枝两种机制以提高探索效率。

Result: 实验表明，GG Explore在复杂任务中效率更高，性能超越现有方法，并在使用较小模型时仍表现出色。

Conclusion: GG Explore框架展示了其在提高知识探索效率及应用中的实际价值，尤其适用于复杂任务场景。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出Semantic Bridge框架，通过语义图编织生成多跳推理问题，用于缓解大语言模型训练中的高质量问答对稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练受限于高质量、多跳推理问题问答对的稀缺性，尤其是在稀疏的、领域特定的语料中，如医学或法律文献。

Method: 提出了一种基于语义图的编织方法，包括实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接三种机制，通过AMR驱动实现细粒度控制的复杂推理问题生成。采用多模态AMR管道提高生成质量。

Result: 在通用数据集和专业领域数据集上表现优异，生成的问题组表现优于手动注释，生成过程材料减少67%。

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge框架开创了一种新的LLM训练数据合成方法，可在稀疏来源中生成具有目标性的复杂推理问题。核心代码和模型将会开源。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为PersonaEval的基准，用于测试LLM是否能可靠地识别人类角色，通过实验发现当前最佳LLM还远不能达到人类水平的角色扮演场景评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的评价方法未验证其对角色扮演真实性的评估能力，而准确的角色识别是进行评估的核心前提。

Method: 基于小说、剧本和视频转录中的对话数据，设计了PersonaEval基准测试，挑战语言模型在对话情境中识别说话角色的能力。

Result: 实验发现，当前性能最好的LLM在角色识别上仅达到69%的准确率，而人类参与者的准确率为90.8%。

Conclusion: 当前的LLM评估器在角色识别和判断角色扮演质量方面与人类仍有较大差距，需要更强的类人推理能力。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了RealTalk-CN，一个中国多回合、多领域语音文本双模态的任务导向对话数据集，主要贡献包括提供语音不流利性、多样化对话场景与跨模态聊天任务，为中文语音大模型研究奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前任务导向对话（TOD）数据集以文本为主，缺少真实语音信号，特别是对语音大模型进行健壮性评估的需求。既有语音TOD数据集多为英语，缺少语音不流利性和说话人差异等关键特性，存在研究缺口。

Method: 提出RealTalk-CN数据集，包括5.4k个对话、60K个语句（150小时），涵盖多场景、配有语音不流利标注；并设计了跨模态聊天任务，支持语音与文本模式的动态切换。

Result: 通过对语音不流利性、说话人特性敏感性及跨领域性能的评估，证明了RealTalk-CN的有效性与多样性。

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN为中文语音任务导向对话系统研究提供全面的基准数据集，是中文语音大模型研究的重要突破。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种创新的方法，通过无需额外训练的MLLM Orchestration实现交互式多模态AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）无法直接整合成统一的多模态输入输出系统的问题，作者旨在通过新的方式解决模态对齐、语音转换效率以及整合问题。

Method: 提出了一种称为MLLM Orchestration的框架，其核心是利用LLM作为控制器，动态协调特化模型，通过三个创新设计：动态任务路由LLM控制器、并行语音交互架构以支持自然对话和中断处理、跨模态记忆系统以维持上下文一致性，并选择性避免不必要的模态调用。

Result: 所提方法在标准基准测试中，比传统联合训练方法性能提升最高达7.8%，同时延时减少了10.3%，并通过显性编排过程显著提高了解释性。

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration通过无需额外训练的方式实现了模块化的、多模态互动系统，大幅提高了效率、性能和解释性，展现了该方法在实际应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型在处理语义相同但表述不同的句子时，生成的结果存在差异，而现有的经验性修正方法如k-NN平滑效果有限。

Method: 提出使用范畴论和同伦理论的方法描述LLM建模的概率分布，通过LLM Markov类别表示语言的概率，在此基础上引入"弱等价性"以捕捉语义等价的表达。

Result: 通过引入更高代数K理论和模范范畴等工具为处理LLMs中的重表达问题铺平理论道路。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解大语言模型中如何通过同伦方法表示语义等价提供了一个新的理论框架，有助于改进生成结果的统一性。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，通过将自然语言问题映射到一个简化的语义问题空间，从而提升小型语言模型（SLM）的推理能力，同时提高其鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在复杂和多样的自然语言问题中推理能力受限的问题，尤其是面对语言冗余和多样性时的挑战。

Method: 提出一种名为DURIT的三步算法，利用强化学习进行问题映射，通过自蒸馏对推理轨迹进行对齐，并在映射后的问题空间中训练推理策略，同时交替训练映射器和推理器。

Result: DURIT在数学和逻辑推理任务上显著提升了小型语言模型的性能，包括域内和域外任务的表现。

Conclusion: 通过将理解与推理解耦，DURIT证明了这一策略在强化小型语言模型推理能力和提高鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习环境中，面对计算、通信与隐私约束，实现语言模型精准且可解释的推理尤为重要，尤其是在需要准确、可追溯决策的医疗领域。

Method: FedCoT框架通过轻量化的链式思维增强机制，结合改进的LoRA模块堆叠与分类感知聚合，提高模型推理性能并确保隐私。

Result: FedCoT在医疗推理任务中的实验表现证明了该方法在资源受限条件下显著提高了性能，同时完整保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 通过FedCoT实现高效且隐私保护的推理能力提升，特别适用于医疗场景的严格要求。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Result: 在金融数据集上的实验表明，LATTE优于现有方法，同时适合需要快速处理的场景。

Conclusion: LATTE降低了长序列处理的成本与复杂性，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时计算方法（如TTT和RAG）在提升大语言模型推理性能方面有效，但存在策略适配查询不足和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 引入奖励引导的测试时计算（RTTC）框架，通过预训练的奖励模型为每个查询自适应选择最有效的测试时计算策略，并结合分布式服务器-客户端架构和查询状态缓存技术优化计算效率。

Result: RTTC在多个大语言模型及基准测试中取得了优异的准确率，证明了其适应性奖励引导策略选择的有效性和性能提升潜力。

Conclusion: RTTC为大语言模型的可扩展高性能适配提供了新的思路，通过奖励驱动的自适应方法在减少计算冗余的同时提高了任务表现。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the

advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

*Kai Zhao,Yanjun Zhao,Jiaming Song,Shien He,Lusheng Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Tianjiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SABER的强化学习框架，用于改进大语言模型（LLMs）的推理效率，支持基于用户需求的推理深度与延迟权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然链式推理提升了LLMs在复杂任务中的精度，但其高推理成本和延迟对实际应用造成阻碍。

Method: 通过对每个训练样本的基本模型推理令牌使用量进行分析，SABER将其归类到预定义的预算层级。其后用系统提示和基于长度的奖励进行细化训练，并加入无推理示例以提高模型可靠性。此外，支持四种推理模式：NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, DeepThink，允许根据预算和需求灵活调整推理深度与延迟。

Result: 在数学推理（MATH, GSM8K）、代码生成（MBPP）以及逻辑推理（LiveBench-Reasoning）评估中，SABER在严格预算下实现高精度，支持跨规模与跨领域的良好泛化能力。例如，SABER-FastThink在MATH基准上削减推理长度达65.4%，并在精度上比基础模型提升3.6%。

Conclusion: SABER框架在优化LLMs推理效率的同时，提供了多模式选择，为实现低延迟高深度推理需求的权衡提供了一种有竞争力的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

TL;DR: 此研究提出了一种结合Transformer嵌入和手工语言特征的筛查方法，通过使用数据增强和多模态模型评估阿尔茨海默病的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现阶段阿尔茨海默病的诊断存在大量漏诊，研究旨在开发一种基于语言的自然语言处理方法，用于检测阿尔茨海默病早期认知衰退。

Method: 研究使用DementiaBank "cookie-theft"任务的转录数据，通过评估Transformer模型和自定义语言特征的结合模型、生成标签条件的合成语音进行数据增强以及多模态模型的分类能力进行方法验证。

Result: 结合模型的F1得分为83.3，当结合使用MedAlpaca-7B生成的合成语音增强数据后F1提高到85.7。单模态模型的性能经过微调显著提升。但当前的多模态模型表现仍不理想。

Conclusion: 结合Transformer嵌入和语言特征提高了阿尔茨海默病检测的性能，微调的LLM可支持分类与数据增强功能，但多模态建模仍需进一步提升。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视用户个性化需求，难以评估个性化文本生成系统的表现。

Method: PREF框架分为三个步骤：使用大语言模型生成通用评价指标；根据用户偏好调整生成个性化评估标准；利用生成的评估标准对文本进行评分。

Result: 在PrefEval基准测试中，PREF比现有基线方法在精确性、校准和人类评判对齐度上表现更优。

Conclusion: PREF框架提供了一种可扩展、透明且用户对齐的评估方法，为个性化语言生成系统的评估和发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语言模型攻击方式——Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ)，通过隐状态插值在多种基准测试中取得了较高的攻击成功率，并同时提出了对抗训练的防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在其语言能力和安全性对抗漏洞之间的矛盾，本研究旨在探索一种能有效绕过其安全校准的攻击方式，并评估及改进其防御措施。

Method: 提出了Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ)攻击方法，通过选择高相似性的查询对，并在模型隐状态中进行梯度引导的插值与优化，从而实现对语言模型安全性的突破。

Result: 在Vicuna、LLaMA-2等语言模型上进行评估，LFJ的攻击成功率平均达到94.01%。同时，提出的对抗训练方法显著降低攻击成功率超过80%。

Conclusion: LFJ方法在绕过语言模型安全限制方面表现出极高的成功率，对模型对抗性和鲁棒性提出了严峻挑战。同时，结合对抗训练方法可显著增强模型的防御能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架IAPO，将提示优化与推理规模结合，同时考虑预算与任务目标，实验验证了其在多任务上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法与推理策略无关，忽略了二者之间的重要联系及用户对预算与任务目标的偏好。

Method: 引入IAPO框架，联合优化提示与推理规模，同时开发PSST算法，以固定预算进行训练并分析错误概率。

Result: 通过在六项任务上验证PSST的有效性，表明推理感知对于优化提示在对齐LLMs中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 将推理感知引入提示优化在结合多目标与预算限制的情况下，提供了更好的对齐与性能表现。

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

Motivation: 探索具有思考模式的LLMs为何更容易受到攻击，并找出其薄弱环节。

Method: 研究提出了一种通过特定提示标记干预LLMs内部思考过程的方法，称为安全思维干预。

Result: 实验表明，安全思维干预显著降低了思考模式下LLMs被攻击的成功率。

Conclusion: 尽管思考模式增强了LLMs的能力，但风险增加，安全干预是缓解攻击的重要手段。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在信息抽取任务中表现良好，但对上下文示例的选择非常敏感，现有方法往往忽略了模型在语义内容和格式生成方面的混淆问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为APIE的主动提示框架，通过引入自我混淆评估概念，结合格式和内容不确定性两个指标，主动选取最具挑战性的样本作为少量示例。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，APIE方法在抽取准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，细粒度、双层次的不确定性视角对于构建高效、可靠的结构化生成系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Conclusion: 当前推理增强型模型在多语言常识推理上仍有不足，提出改进方向以增强此类能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境下的语言模型评估提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，推进了可信和可复现的自然语言处理评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

Motivation: 随着机器翻译质量接近完美，辨别最先进的模型以及发现改进方向变得困难，因此需要一种方法自动识别机器翻译系统表现不佳的文本。

Method: 定义翻译难度的估算任务，提出新的评估指标，并开发多种估算方法，包括模型Sentinel-src。使用这些估算器构建更具挑战性的机器翻译基准。

Result: 研究结果表明，专门的Sentinel-src模型优于基于启发式的手段（如词语稀有度、句法复杂性）和使用大型语言模型作为判定者的方法。同时，提供了两种改进模型，Sentinel-src-24和Sentinel-src-25。

Conclusion: Sentinel-src模型可以高效筛选更具挑战性的文本，有助于提升机器翻译评估以及未来研究的指导。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多大语言模型主要基于西方数据进行训练和评估，对于低资源语言和区域背景的公平性关注较少。本文旨在弥补这一空白，尤其是在巴基斯坦文化与语言背景下。

Method: 作者开发了PakBBQ数据集，包含214个模板和17180个QA对，覆盖年龄、残疾、外貌、性别、社会经济地位、宗教等八个偏见维度，并对多语言大语言模型在不同场景下的表现进行了评估。

Result: 实验显示：在明确语义时模型精确度提升12%；乌尔都语环境下的反偏见表现强于英语；对于以消极方式提出问题的情境，模型表现出的刻板印象回答减少。

Conclusion: 研究表明在低资源环境中使用情境化的基准测试和简单的提示设计策略，有助于偏见的缓解和模型公平性的提升。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

Method: 提出了一种名为Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM)的轻量框架，通过使用句子嵌入的联合聚类和信息理论指标来测量提示与响应的语义差异。

Result: 基于指标如$S_H$和KL散度构建了一个叫Semantic Box的诊断工具，用以分类和检测LLM的响应类型及其行为特征。

Conclusion: SDM改进了语义一致性检测，提供了一种有效识别虚构及危险生成内容的工具，对LLMs的可靠性研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

### [151] [Using Large Language Models to Measure Symptom Severity in Patients At Risk for Schizophrenia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10226)
*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从临床访谈记录中预测精神分裂症高危患者的BPRS评分，具有良好准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决当前临床实践中不常使用BPRS评分这一问题，研究希望通过LLMs提高其适用性和便利性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型从409名精神分裂症高危患者的访谈记录中预测BPRS评分，并考察其在外语评估和纵向信息整合中的表现。

Result: LLM预测的BPRS评分与真实评分的一致性中位数为0.84，ICC为0.73，接近人类评估者的一致性；多语言环境中一致性中位数为0.88，ICC为0.70。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效预测BPRS评分，在不同语言环境和学习方法上表现出潜力，可改善精神分裂症高危患者的评估流程。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Toki Pona在不同社区使用中如何类似自然语言发生变化及演化。

Method: 采用计算与语料库分析，对词类灵活性、句法位置偏好等特征进行研究。

Result: 结果表明，社会语言学因素影响了Toki Pona，类似于自然语言，并且在社区使用过程中自然演化。

Conclusion: 人造语言如Toki Pona会随着使用者群体的互动而自然发展，体现了与自然语言一致的变化机制。

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型(LLMs)对微小提示词变化的敏感性相关问题，并优化模型诱导偏置以提高任务表现。

Method: 通过“诱导偏置提取与匹配”策略，利用LLM的部分输出作为提示，以产生更符合模型偏向的提示设计。

Result: 该方法在分类任务的Likert评分中提升了19%，在排序任务中提升了27%。

Conclusion: 利用诱导偏置提取与匹配策略，可以通过设计更加贴合LLM偏置的提示显著提高模型效能。

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）中的性别和种族偏见，提出结合定性和定量方法的框架，并分析其生成的文本结果反映的社会不平等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏见检测方法多为定量化、自动化，难以捕捉自然语言中微妙的偏见表现。因此提出以定性、话语分析为视角的补充方法。

Method: 通过定性人工分析，研究大语言模型生成的关于黑人女性和白人女性的短篇故事，探讨模型中性别和种族偏见的表现。

Result: 研究发现模型对黑人女性的刻画集中于与祖先和抗争的联系，而对白人女性则多体现为自我发现过程。此外，模型在修正偏见时表现为表面化修改，但未能根本解决问题。

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过其话语强化了社会不平等现象，表明算法的意识形态功能的局限性，呼吁在AI设计和应用中采用批判性和跨学科方法。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DOTABLER，一个面向表格的语义文档解析框架，专注于表格及其上下文的深层语义解析，针对性地解决跨段数据解释和语义一致性分析问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注表面任务，如布局分析、表格检测和数据提取，未能深入解析表格及其上下文关联，限制了高级任务的实现。

Method: 引入一个定制数据集，通过在预训练模型基础上的领域特定微调，DOTABLER整合了完整的解析流程，识别与表格语义相关联的上下文部分，并实现了两个主要功能：面向表格的文档结构解析和领域特定表格检索。

Result: DOTABLER在近4000页、超过1000个表格的真实PDF中进行了评估，其精确度和F1得分均超过90%，在表格与上下文语义分析以及深度文档解析方面优于GPT-4等先进模型。

Conclusion: DOTABLER证明了在表格-上下文语义分析和深层文档解析方面的高效性和先进性，为复杂信息解析任务提供了精准可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 本文提出FreLLM4Rec方法，通过频谱视角平衡语义与协作信息，使用全局低通滤波器和时间频率调制器，有效改善LLMs在推荐系统中的协作信号削弱问题，在四个基准数据集上取得了最高提升8%的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大语言模型(LLMs)进行推荐系统，同时解决其过于强调语义相关性且削弱协作信号的问题。

Method: 提出FreLLM4Rec方法，利用全局图低通滤波器清除无关高频噪声，并通过时间频率调制机制逐层保留协作信号，实现频率域过滤器与图傅里叶过滤器的效率折中。

Result: FreLLM4Rec在四个基准数据集上实现了最高8%的NDCG@10提升，证明了该方法在协作信息处理上的有效性。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec展现了在LLMs中处理协作信息的潜力，为改进基于LLM的推荐系统提供了理论依据和技术路径。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的跨语言迁移方法，通过引入Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE)和Dual Soft Prompt机制，专注于提高低表现语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注通过小型神经网络提示编码器稳定训练，但未探索其在跨语言迁移上的潜力，而本文填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE)，结合多源训练和轻量编码架构以捕获跨语言的抽象模式；提出Dual Soft Prompt机制，通过结合编码器提示和标准软提示提高语言兼容性。

Result: 实验表明XPE对低表现语言尤为有效，同时混合设计在多语言设置中具有更广的适应性。

Conclusion: 通过XPE和Dual Soft Prompt，本文不仅提升了低表现语言的适应性能，同时为多语言任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种双阶段微调策略，使Qwen3 14B大语言模型具备韩国本地化推理能力，结合监督微调（SFT）与强化学习（GRPO），模型在韩国逻辑推理和整体问题解决能力上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在使Qwen3 14B语言模型能够原生地用韩语进行逻辑推理，从而提升其在韩语语言任务以及高级推理任务中的表现。

Method: 第一阶段通过对高质量韩语推理数据集的监督微调（SFT），建立模型在韩语逻辑推理上的基础能力；第二阶段使用定制的GRPO强化学习算法，结合引入的oracle judge模型稳定训练过程，进一步优化其推理能力与问题解决性能。

Result: 模型在高级推理基准（如数学和代码任务）上展示出了显著改进，同时保留了知识和语言能力，成功实现了全韩语的内在思维链推理。

Conclusion: 通过双阶段微调与优化，该方法成功增强了Qwen3 14B的韩语推理和问题解决能力，为大语言模型的本地化优化提供了一种通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

Motivation: 现有跨语言观点情感分析主要关注简单任务且依赖翻译工具，低资源语言面临挑战。

Method: 提出一种新的序列到序列方法，采用约束解码技术，摆脱翻译工具的依赖。

Result: 这种方法在跨语言ABSA任务中性能提升高达10%，并能处理更复杂的任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了无需翻译工具的高效替代方案，研究还表明多语言LLMs表现优于仅英语的LLMs。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Motivation: 捷克文本特别是历史文档的总结因语言复杂性和标注数据不足而研究较少，故探索适用的方法。

Method: 运用先进的大型语言模型Mistral和mT5对捷克文本进行总结测试。

Result: 在现代数据集SumeCzech上取得了最新的最优结果，并开发了用于历史文档总结的新数据集Posel od Čerchova，且提供基准结果。

Conclusion: 本研究推动了捷克文本特别是历史文本总结的研究，并为相关领域研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

Conclusion: 新方法在跨语言情感分析中解决多语言和多任务瓶颈，提供了实际建议，并对跨语言情感分析方法的优劣进行了深入评价。

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

Motivation: 现有的恶意内容检测方法要么依赖耗时的人工注释，要么依赖精度不稳定的LLM，因此需要一种高效又准确的方法来检测和清理恶意数据内容。

Method: 采用混合评估框架（MDH），将基于LLM的注释与最少的人类监督相结合。同时，提出两种新策略：D-Attack通过上下文模拟增强攻击效果，DH-CoT结合被劫持的思维链提高攻击成功率。

Result: 验证了MDH框架可以用于恶意内容检测和数据清理，并证明了新策略D-Attack和DH-CoT能有效提升攻击的成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，对开发者消息的精心设计能够显著提高攻击成功率，并提出的混合评估框架MDH在数据清理和恶意检测方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ComoRAG的模型，用于长篇叙事理解，其主要通过动态迭代式内存推理处理复杂的长文本，从而改进了传统RAG方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长篇故事及小说中的复杂情节线和角色关系使得理解任务具有挑战性；传统RAG方法受限于单步检索的静态性质，难以捕捉长距离上下文中的动态关系。

Method: ComoRAG通过动态内存推理，在推理困难时进行迭代循环，包括生成探测性查询和整合新的证据到全局记忆池，以构建连贯的上下文完成查询。

Result: 在四个包含200K+ token的长篇叙事基准测试中，ComoRAG相较于强基线提升了最高11%的性能。

Conclusion: ComoRAG为基于检索的长文本理解提供了一个状态化推理的认知驱动范式，特别适用于需要全局理解的复杂查询。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了IdiomEval框架，揭示大型语言模型在中文成语翻译中的不足，并通过900组翻译对分析指出系统普遍存在错误、漏译等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型在处理中文成语翻译中的能力，鉴于中文成语独特的历史背景与结构挑战。

Method: 搭建IdiomEval框架并设计全面错误分类，从九个翻译系统中采集来自四种领域的900组翻译对，进行人工标注与误判分析。同时对现有评价指标进行评估并开发改进模型。

Result: 发现系统在成语翻译中表现不佳，最佳系统（GPT-4）的错误率也达28%。同时，评价指标与人工评分的皮尔逊相关性不高（<0.48），改进模型的误判检测F1得分为0.68。

Conclusion: 目前的翻译系统普遍在中文成语翻译上表现不佳，亟需优化，并通过改进的误判检测模型推动评价与翻译精度的提升。

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过引入一种“计算经济学”框架，提高了大语言模型（LLMs）在计算资源有限情况下的效率和稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型由于计算成本高昂，在资源有限情况下表现受限。基于此，论文旨在开发更高效的模型结构。

Method: 提出一种激励驱动的训练模式，将任务损失与可微分的计算成本相结合，以激励稀疏高效的激活模式，并基于观察重新分配关注到高价值tokens上。

Result: 使用GLUE和WikiText-103任务测试，新方法形成了比事后剪枝更优的帕累托解，对应40%的FLOPS减少和更低的延迟，同时关注模式更具解释性。

Conclusion: 经济学原则为设计在资源受限条件下高效、自适应、透明的大语言模型提供了一条有效路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR 是一个框架，用于从大型视觉语言模型中生成多样、真实且相关的推理依据，以助力多模态虚假信息检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型生成的推理存在多样性不足、事实不准确以及内容无关或冲突的问题，限制了其在虚假信息检测中的有效性。

Method: 引入了一个名为 DiFaR 的无检测器依赖框架，使用五种链式推理提示生成不同推理路径，并通过轻量级的后处理模块，基于句子级别的事实性和相关性得分过滤推理句子。

Result: 在四个流行基准上，DiFaR 比四类基线提升了最多5.9%，并在提升现有检测器性能上表现出最多8.7%的增幅。

Conclusion: 实验表明，DiFaR 能显著改善推理质量（多样性、准确性和相关性），有助于推动虚假信息检测任务的发展。

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在NLP中解释性与隐私保护之间的潜在关系，试图揭示是可以实现二者兼顾还是它们互相冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释性与隐私保护近年来受到广泛关注，但两者交集领域的研究相对缺乏，需要探索是否存在取舍矛盾。

Method: 通过以差分隐私（DP）和后验解释性方法为指导，研究NLP任务中隐私-解释性平衡问题。

Result: 发现隐私与解释性之间复杂的关系取决于任务类型及方法选择，并表明二者在某些条件下可以共存。

Conclusion: 提供一系列实用建议以促进未来在隐私与解释性交集领域的研究和应用。

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

TL;DR: 针对多模态大型语言模型中普遍存在的文本主导问题，本研究提出了两个评估指标并进行全面分析，同时提出了一种简单的令牌压缩方法以均衡模型注意机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大型语言模型在多任务中表现出色，但其高度依赖文本，导致其他模态未被充分利用，这种现象被称为文本主导问题，需对其原因和改进方法进行深入研究。

Method: 提出了两个评估指标：模态主导指数（MDI）和注意力效率指数（AEI），并应用于多种数据模态的系统性分析；此外，引入了一种令牌压缩方法以解决文本主导问题。

Result: 通过分析发现文本主导问题根植于注意力稀释、融合架构设计和任务设置，提出的令牌压缩方法成功将LLaVA-7B的MDI从10.23大幅降低到0.86。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态语言模型的公平性和全面性发展奠定了基础，同时提供了一种有效的方法来缓解文本主导问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study on the deployment of a European Deep
Inference Fabric (eDIF), an NDIF-compatible infrastructure designed to support
mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic
interpretability research.

Conclusion: 本文所提出的融合方法优于现有技术，且首次为BornilDB v1.0数据集设立基准测试，推动无词汇翻译研究以及手语的沟通可达性。

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前个性化大语言模型的训练方法依赖于标量奖励信号，该信号通常较弱，无法提供有效反馈，限制了学习效率和个性化质量。

Method: 论文提出使用自然语言反馈（NLF）替代标量奖励信号，以用户档案和问题叙述为条件生成反馈，迭代优化模型策略并实现内化的个性化策略。通过交替优化反馈模型与策略模型提升性能。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准数据集的多个领域取得了显著优于现有技术的结果，并在人类评估中证明生成的回答质量更高。

Conclusion: 自然语言反馈作为监督信号能有效提升个性化问答的优化效果，VAC框架显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上提升准确率至17.29%，实现4.12倍加速；在MMLU数据集上实现高达276.67倍的加速，同时保持了竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: ICE框架通过灵活利用扩散大语言模型的特性，显著提升了处理速度和性能，展示了原位提示策略的潜力。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，大语言模型在顺序决策任务中的表现受到其规模和计算成本的限制，特别是现有方法无法处理多步任务中的信用分配问题，因此需要研发适用于小规模模型的优化方法。

Method: 通过建立文本-介导随机博弈（TSMG）和语言-代理策略（LAP）框架，引入了多步组相对策略优化（MS-GRPO）算法，并提出绝对优势加权的样本采样策略以提升训练效果。

Result: 后训练的3B参数模型在Frozen Lake任务中的性能比72B基础模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: 本文方法证明，针对性的后训练是一种可行且高效的替代方案，可以在不依赖模型规模的情况下显著提升小规模LLMs的顺序决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究在语言使用质量检查不足、因数据稀缺和不平衡导致的建模低效以及预测结果缺乏解释等方面存在不足。

Method: 通过特征工程、数据增强和解释性机器学习，开发一个基于透明特征和Shapley Value分析的多维建模框架。

Conclusion: 该研究强调解释性，提供传统人工评价的可扩展、可靠且透明的替代方案，并支持自我调节学习。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在强化学习（RL）中的潜力，通过减少对外部搜索引擎的依赖，实现高效的代理搜索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少RL任务中对昂贵的外部搜索引擎交互的依赖，同时挖掘LLMs的潜在搜索能力。

Method: 提出Self-Search方法，通过结构化提示和多次采样量化LLMs的搜索能力；并进一步提出Self-Search RL（SSRL），利用奖励机制强化其内部搜索能力。

Result: 实验证明SSRL训练的策略模型提供了成本效益更优、稳定的搜索驱动RL环境，可以有效减少对外部搜索引擎的依赖并实现稳健的sim-to-real迁移。

Conclusion: LLMs具备高性能的世界知识挖掘能力；SSRL减少了模型幻象问题，并优化了与外部搜索引擎的整合，展示了支持可扩展RL代理训练的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DRAs中的大多数系统都是闭源的，缺乏透明性和学术界对其性能进行公正评估的机会，因此作者希望对开放源码的DRA进行研究和改进。

Method: 作者将现有的BrowseComp基准调整为更易计算的BC-Small版本，使用它来对开放源码系统ODR和两个闭源系统进行测试，并在此基础上提出了三项改进，形成ODR+模型。

Result: 改进后的ODR+在BC-Small的测试中取得了10%的成功率，这在所有闭源和开源系统中表现最佳，而其余系统的成功率均为0%。

Conclusion: ODR通过三项具体改进（ODR+）在性能上表现出了显著进步，验证了其潜在价值，并提供了开放系统改进的范例。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种方法，通过控制生成长度优化偏好，显著减少大规模推理模型的输出长度，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推理模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但其输出冗长增加了计算成本，并可能导致过度思考，如何平衡推理的高效性与有效性是一个挑战。

Method: 分析生成路径分布，利用难度估计对轨迹进行筛选，并基于Bradley-Terry损失框架对多种偏好优化方法的目标收敛行为进行分析，进而提出长度控制偏好优化（LCPO）方法。

Result: LCPO方法在多个基准上的实验表明，平均输出长度减少超过50%，同时推理性能得以保持。

Conclusion: LCPO方法证明了通过高效计算来指导大规模推理模型进行高效推理的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: KompeteAI是一种新型的AutoML框架，通过动态探索解决方案空间和引入预测评分模型及加速调试方法，大幅提升了系统性能并提出了新的基准测试工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基础的AutoML系统存在探索策略受限和执行瓶颈的挑战，如方法缺乏多样性、无法充分重组强部分解决方案，以及代码验证周期过长影响优化效率。

Method: KompeteAI采用动态解决方案空间探索，融合强候选方案，利用RAG方法从外部资源（如Kaggle和arXiv）引入真实世界策略，并通过预测评分和加速调试方法减少执行耗时约6.9倍。

Result: KompeteAI在主要的AutoML基准测试MLE-Bench中比领先方法平均提升3%，并在新基准测试Kompete-bench中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过结合动态探索、多源策略引入及效率提升技术，KompeteAI显著推动AutoML性能，使得其在现有基准和新基准中表现优越。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Conclusion: 熵势框架为AI领域的不确定性管理提供了理论基础和实用工具，连接了热力学、信息理论与机器学习。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的奖励机制，用于优化复杂推理模型的效率问题，能够显著减少结果长度，同时保持高效和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的复杂推理模型在完成复杂任务时有显著进展，但存在过度思考的问题，即在简单任务上消耗过多计算资源，降低效率。现有方法对任务准确性要求较高，限制了其灵活性和可靠性。本研究旨在解决这一问题，优化推理过程。

Method: 提出了一种基于规则的可验证逐步奖励机制（VSRM），通过评估推理轨迹中间状态的表现来分配奖励。这种方法直观且与逐步推理任务的本质一致，并结合PPO和Reinforce++进行了实验验证。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集（如AIME24和AIME25）上进行的实验表明，VSRM方法在保持原有推理性能的同时大幅减少了输出长度，并在效率与准确性间达到了平衡。

Conclusion: VSRM有效抑制了复杂推理中的无效步骤，鼓励合理推理，从根本上缓解了过度思考问题，为增强效率和可靠性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Method: HATRPO-W基于KKT方法在全局KL约束下优化阈值分配；HATRPO-G基于改进-发散比优先进行贪婪分配。

Result: 实验表明HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G在多种MARL基准测试中显著提升性能，收敛更快，最终奖励提升超过22.5%。

Conclusion: HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G改进了HATRPO方法，在异质多智能体环境下实现更灵活高效的学习，其中HATRPO-W具有更稳定的学习动态。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型在信息稀疏环境中进行创造性推理的能力，并提出TurtleSoup-Bench基准、Mosaic-Agent代理和多维度评价协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准不能捕捉动态探索性推理，因此需要新的研究框架来评估语言模型的创造性推理能力。

Method: 引入了一个基于'Turtle Soup'游戏的全面研究框架，包括TurtleSoup-Bench基准、Mosaic-Agent以及多维度评价协议。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在创造性推理方面的能力有限，与人类相比有显著的性能差距，并存在常见失败模式。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLMs的创造性推理提供了新见解，并为探索性代理行为的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出LeanRAG，通过语义汇总算法和自下而上的结构引导检索策略解决现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法中存在的语义孤岛和低效检索问题，显著提升问答系统的响应质量并减少了46%的重复检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法存在语义孤岛和低效检索的挑战，影响大语言模型利用外部知识的效率和效果。

Method: 提出LeanRAG框架，包括以实体聚类为核心的语义汇总算法和自下而上的结构引导检索策略。通过构建可导航的语义网络，实现高效且上下文完整的证据集合检索。

Result: 在四个跨领域的高难度问答基准测试中，LeanRAG在响应质量上显著优于现有方法，减少了46%的检索冗余。

Conclusion: LeanRAG提出了一种结合知识聚合与检索的新型协作方式，解决了传统方法的语义孤岛和结构无感问题，以更高效的方式为大语言模型提供了更优质量的知识支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法HiRef，结合医学本体的层次语义和电子健康记录(EHR)的共现模式，用于改进药物推荐的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对于电子健康记录的药物推荐模型，由于EHR数据本身存在稀有观测实体和不完整记录，难以在缺失或新颖条件下实现良好的泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种统一框架HiRef，将医学本体中的层次语义用超曲空间嵌入，与EHR的共现图精化相结合，并通过一种稀疏正则化方法抑制虚假边，提升推荐模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV的基准数据集上表现优异，且在模拟的新代码场景下能维持高准确性。

Conclusion: HiRef有效提升了药物推荐的泛化能力和鲁棒性，尤其在应对未见医疗代码时展现出强大能力。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过全方位方法提升了多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力，为该领域提供了新的研究方向与工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了框架FIRESPARQL，专注于利用改进的大语言模型（LLMs）生成高质量SPARQL查询，用于学术知识图谱上的问答任务，其实验结果表明微调模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在学术知识图谱中，因其复杂内容和结构，基于自然语言问题生成操作SPARQL查询非常困难。现有大语言模型生成的SPARQL查询存在结构不一致性和语义错误。

Method: 提出了FIRESPARQL框架，将经过微调的LLMs作为核心组件，结合检索增强生成（RAG）和SPARQL查询校正模块，以提高查询生成的准确性。

Result: 通过使用SciQA基准，采用不同配置（零样本、零样本+RAG、单样本、微调、微调+RAG）进行评估，微调模型在查询精度达0.90 ROUGE-L，在结果精度达0.85 RelaxedEM。

Conclusion: 框架FIRESPARQL提供了一种改进LLM生成SPARQL查询的方法，其中微调步骤是提升性能的关键，显著提高了学术知识图谱问答的准确性。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线地图等现代空间服务在处理复杂任务（如同时搜索多个位置）时受限，需要更灵活的查询方式。

Method: 利用LLMs的语言能力，开展空间查询任务，包括用户澄清需求、动态调整搜索等，同时引入特定的LLM适配流程，将自然语言与结构化空间数据和查询对齐。

Result: SEQ-GPT实现了面向实际数据和应用场景的端到端空间搜索演示，改进了查询范围和交互体验。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLMs在改进空间搜索任务中的潜力，为复杂查询提供了更广泛的应用可能性。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了以AI为主导、医生为辅助的全流程诊断新模式，并引入DxDirector-7B强化诊断效率与准确性，同时降低医生工作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在临床诊断中主要辅助作用，难以独立完成从模糊主诉到整体诊断的全流程，这限制了AI真正减轻医生工作量的潜力。

Method: 提出了DxDirector-7B，一个具备深度思考能力的LLM，用于驱动全流程临床诊断，同时建立了明确的误诊责任划分框架。

Result: DxDirector-7B在稀有、复杂和真实病例的全流程诊断中展现出优异的诊断准确性，并显著减轻医生的工作负担。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B以其卓越的诊断效率和准确性，标志着AI从辅助工具转变为全流程驱动的新阶段，具有潜力替代医学专科医生应对诊断工作。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

TL;DR: 现有工具增强型代理系统在现实世界中受限于黑箱推理步骤、多模态结合的不足以及刚性低效的代理流程。PASS（概率代理超网采样）是针对胸部X射线推理的首个多模态框架，解决了以上问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统存在信任不足、安全风险、多模态差及效率低下等问题，尤其在医疗场景中亟需改进工具组合与推理路径的适应能力。

Method: 提出PASS框架，通过在多工具图上自适应采样，结合任务条件分布选择合适工具，提供概率标注的推理路径，并采用三阶段训练优化性能和计算成本。

Result: PASS在多个基准测试中表现显著优于现有方法，在精度、AUC、LLM-J等指标上取得显著进步，同时兼顾计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS代表了一种向可解释、自适应和多模态的医学代理系统发展的新范式，为胸部X射线推理提供了高效、安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Motivation: 改善语言模型对人类偏好对齐的表现，以构建更可靠的人工智能系统。

Method: 提出对齐阶段假设，将对齐过程分为偏好引入阶段（益于数据多样性）及偏好微调阶段（偏向高质量数据），通过理论和实验验证并开发有效算法识别阶段边界。

Result: 实验表明，对齐阶段假设及其边界识别方法在5种模型（Llama、Zephyr等）与2种对齐方法（DPO、SLiC-HF）上的普适性和有效性。

Conclusion: 不同阶段的数据需求不同，理解并合理利用这一区分可显著提升语言模型对人类偏好的对齐效率和效果。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂领域如数学推理中的表现仍然存在显著挑战，尤其是推理链中由于训练标注中的估计误差所引发的局限性。

Method: 提出了ComMCS方法，通过线性合并当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡罗估计器，构建出一个无偏估计器，以减少方差而不增加额外的计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，在MATH-500和GSM8K等基准上，ComMCS方法的性能优于回归优化方法和非降方差基线方法，具体在MATH-500的Best-of-32实验中提高了2.8分和2.2分。

Conclusion: ComMCS方法有效减少了推理中方差问题，同时保持了无偏性，是改善大语言模型数学推理能力的有效手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

Motivation: 现有方法在多属性操控时容易出现干扰和权衡的问题，亟需一种能有效处理多个属性的控制方法。

Method: 通过分配正交子空间分别表示每个属性，并结合混合子空间构建策略及动态权重函数，实现精准操控。此外，引入了基于token的动态操控机制，提升语义相关性干预能力。

Result: 实验表明，MSRS显著减少了属性冲突问题，在多种属性控制任务中效果优于现有方法，并成功推广到多样化的下游任务。

Conclusion: MSRS以其高效的多属性操控能力和广泛的任务适应性，为语言模型的内部激活控制提供了一种全新的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 当前对话推荐系统难以捕捉用户偏好深层语义，且难以有效结合外部知识图谱信息，这限制了推荐质量。

Method: 提出STEP模型，通过三阶段课程的F-Former模块对话上下文和知识图谱实体对齐，利用两个轻量提示调优实现语义增强和推荐精度提升。

Result: 实验表明，STEP在推荐精度和对话质量上超越主流方法，在两个公开数据集上均表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: STEP模型通过整合语言模型和知识图谱语义，有效提升对话推荐系统的准确性和用户体验。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Motivation: 探讨如何在异构知识源、特别是生物医学领域，进行高效的语义互操作与整合。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成文本定义，结合嵌入模型进行候选对齐项检索，并使用精确匹配工具提升对齐精度。

Result: 在OAEI Bio-ML任务中，GenOM框架表现优异，超越传统和现代LLM方法，同时验证了语义增强及少样本提示效果的有效性。

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Motivation: 现有的设计评估涉及多个方面，但缺乏能全面集成各评审意见的系统。

Method: 利用基于图匹配的上下文示例选择方法和独特的提示扩展技术，使多个代理设计意识增强，协作进行设计分析。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，Agentic-DRS在评估图形设计和生成可操作反馈方面更具效用和效率。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了Agentic-DRS系统的潜力，并开拓了一个实际但未充分研究的方向。

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

Motivation: 现有结合深度强化学习和图神经网络的泛化规划方法在大规模网格环境中存在稀疏性、内存需求增加及学习不可行的问题，亟需优化表示方法。

Method: 设计了一种稀疏、目标感知的图神经网络表示方式，编码与目标相关的局部关系并整合空间特征，并通过基于PDDL的网格世界无人机任务验证方法有效性。

Conclusion: 提出方法为解决真实大规模泛化规划任务提供了实践基础，并证明其在大型网格规划问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了AI生成内容在网络上对人类感知和行为的影响，并提出了新的数据集和方法，提升对这些内容的理解和互动能力，提供应对AI生成误导信息的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容日益普及，误导信息的风险增加，但目前针对这些影响人类行为的研究有限。尤其在像股市这样领域，预测观众反应可能比内容验证更重要。

Method: 引入了人类感知数据集MhAIM，包含约15万帖，其中11万为AI生成，进行大规模分析，提出了三个新评估指标：可信度、影响力以及开放性。同时设计了T-Lens系统，融合了人类反应模型（HR-MCP）协议以改进交互和解释能力。

Result: 研究发现，加入图文信息有助于用户更准确识别AI内容，尤其是二者存在不一致时。提出的T-Lens系统能够更有效预测和解释人类反应，优化了人机交互。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升LLM相关对人反应的理解能力和交互性提供了一种切实可行的路径，同时提出了降低AI驱动误导性信息风险的策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [211] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过构建一项临床试验自然语言推理基准测试，评估了六种当代大型语言模型在推理任务中的表现和能力。尽管这些模型在知识获取方面表现优秀，但在推理任务中的表现仍然较差，并揭示了语言模型在结构性和表征性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望探讨大型语言模型在扩大数据和参数规模后是否能获得结构化且可泛化的内部表征。对特定领域（如临床推理）的人工智能可靠性的了解至关重要。

Method: 构建了临床试验自然语言推理基准，包括因果归因、组合性理解、认知验证和风险状态抽象的推理任务，同时引入目标化的知识推理验证探测（GKMRV）以评估语言模型中的知识访问和推理能力。

Result: 模型在知识验证任务（GKMRV）中表现接近完美（平均准确率0.918），但在主要推理任务中的表现较差（平均准确率0.25）。尽管推理准确率低，但推理结果在样本间具有高度一致性（平均一致性0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前的语言模型虽掌握了相关临床知识，但缺乏结构化、可组合的内部表征，使得其在高风险领域中的推理能力受到限制。研究提供了一种方法来明确地衡量知识与推理的分离，从而更好地评估LLM在复杂领域任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了可解释人工智能(XAI)在视觉障碍用户中可用性不足的问题，并提出了一种包容性设计的方法论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能在决策关键领域的广泛应用，其输出的可解释性被认为是帮助用户做出更明智选择的关键。然而，针对视觉障碍用户的XAI方法的可访问性仍缺乏研究。

Method: 通过文献综述和方法论验证，结合79项研究，作者分析了现有XAI方法的不足，提出了一个四部分的包容性设计框架，包括AI系统分类、用户画像定义与背景化、原型设计与实现以及专家和用户评估。

Result: 研究发现，简化的解释比详尽的解释更适合非视觉用户理解，并且采用多模态呈现能够提高公平的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究填补了XAI方法在可访问性领域的空白，为构建对视障用户友好的XAI方法提供了理论和实践依据。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究介绍了一种名为OpenFPL的开源方法，用于预测Fantasy Premier League玩家表现，预测准确度与领先商业服务相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高精度预测服务通常依赖于不公开的商业数据和算法，限制了广泛玩家的使用需求。这项研究旨在通过公开数据提供一样高精度的免费预测方法。

Method: 使用公开数据（包括Fantasy Premier League和Understat的数据）开发了专为特定位置优化的合奏模型，并使用2020-2024赛季的数据进行模型训练和测试。

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季测试中实现了与领先商业服务相当的预测准确度，且在高回报球员的预测中表现优越，适用于多个时间范围的预测。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为Fantasy Premier League社区提供了一种开源、高精度的预测工具，能支持短期和长期的策略制定，并取代当前的商业工具。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Motivation: 当前AI在主动学习和推断领域发展迅速，但表格数据分析领域的前沿技术依然依赖GBDT，本研究旨在引入一种利用神经网络相关技术的方法，以改进表格数据分析的性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为xRFM的算法，将特征学习核方法和树结构结合，使其能够调整数据的局部结构，同时支持海量训练数据的可扩展性。

Result: xRFM在与31种其他方法的比较中，100个回归数据集中取得最佳表现，在200个分类数据集中也优于GBDT，同时该方法原生提供了可解释性。

Conclusion: 新算法xRFM展示了在表格数据上的显著优势，是GBDT的强有力竞争对手，并通过其可扩展性和可解释性为表格数据分析任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Method: 研究随机分配13,463位Fitbit用户进入四个实验组（对照组、随机组、固定逻辑组、强化学习组），并比较各组的每日步数变化。强化学习组通过RL算法个性化选择提醒内容和时间。

Result: 强化学习组在1个月和2个月后每日步数显著增加，分别比对照组多出296步（p=0.0002）和210步（p=0.0122），相比其他组也表现优越。

Conclusion: 强化学习算法的数字健康干预工具能有效提高身体活动水平，为开发更个性化、可扩展的健康干预方案提供了新思路。

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

Method: 本文通过案例研究，测量了先进预测模型（如Chronos、DeepAR、PatchTST等）的稳定性和准确性，数据来源于M5竞赛和Favorita销售数据。

Result: 结果表明，集成模型在不显著下降甚至提升准确性的情况下提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 本文呼吁进一步研究生产系统中部署模型的预测稳定性。这是保证模型实用性和减少人工干预的关键。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Conclusion: 小型LLMs可以通过简单有效的训练方法，解决图任务并展示较强泛化能力，无需依赖复杂的专门图编码模型。

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and

made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

TL;DR: 引入了新的强化微调框架（Nested-ReFT），提高了大型语言模型在数学等推理领域的训练效率，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准ReFT框架下训练成本高的问题，尤其是在生成推理及答案时需要多步计算的情况下。

Method: 提出一种名为Nested-ReFT的框架，它通过跳过部分模型层实现动态行为建模，从而降低推理成本。同时，结合偏差减小技术来保持性能。

Result: 实验证明，Nested-ReFT在多个数学推理基准任务和不同模型规模上提高了训练的计算效率（例如tokens/sec），且性能指标与标准ReFT相当。

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT框架在确保模型高性能的同时，有效减少了计算开销，展现出在复杂推理任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Motivation: 现有的时间序列神经网络在解决预训练任务时选择较为基于直觉，但其迁移至下游任务的效果不一定理想，因此本研究希望通过理论指导的嵌入几何结构改进预训练方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的半监督预训练策略，结合旋转等角紧框架分类器和伪标签，以模拟神经分类器的最佳训练现象，并融入生成型任务和新的序列数据增强策略以提高时间动态捕捉能力。

Result: 在三个多变量时间序列分类数据集上的实验，证明该方法在LSTM、transformers及状态空间模型上显著优于现有的预训练任务。

Conclusion: 将理论驱动嵌入几何与预训练目标对齐可有效提高时间序列分类模型的性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种基于反事实解释的后处理OOD检测方法，能够准确检测分布外数据，并在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-200等数据集上取得了杰出的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保证机器学习系统安全应用的背景下，需要一种准确且可解释的分布外（OOD）检测方法。现有研究表明，使用特征到决策边界的距离可以有效识别OOD数据。

Method: 通过反事实解释计算输入到决策边界的距离，且为解决大型架构计算开销大问题，提出直接在嵌入空间中计算反事实的策略。这种方法不仅提高了扩展性，还能利用反事实解释来辅助理解检测结果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，本文方法的AUROC为93.50%，FPR95为25.80%。在CIFAR-100数据集上，AUROC达到97.05%，FPR95降至13.79%。在更复杂的ImageNet-200数据集上，本方法的AUROC为92.55%，FPR95为33.55%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于反事实解释的OOD检测方法具有高准确性、扩展性和良好的结果可解释性，在多个数据集上的表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95
across four OOD datasets

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Motivation: 观察到推理语言模型可通过中间步骤整合现有能力，并在部分任务中比过去模型更具泛化能力，因此需要深入研究关键任务中的表现。

Method: 提出一种基于基准测试作为学习目标的选择策略，并展示其在DeepSeek-R1模型上的效果。

Result: 研究表明，推理语言模型的良好表现不仅受测试时算法改进或模型规模的影响，还受到基准测试的影响。

Conclusion: 将基准测试视为培训课程，可以平衡评估与学习，强调测试任务的新颖性在评估推理模型泛化能力中的关键作用。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Motivation: 跨国象牙贸易威胁非洲大象种群，但象牙走私网络难以追踪。现有DNA分析虽有效但成本高昂，手写标记未被充分利用。

Method: 通过人工智能管道对8次象牙扣押事件中的6,085张图片进行分析，并利用目标检测模型提取超过17,000个手写标记，同时标记和描述这些信息。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了人工智能在野生动物取证中的潜力，提出了将手写分析整合到打击野生动物犯罪中的具体步骤。

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

TL;DR: 使用局部谷值（LV）为中心的分析方法评估D-Wave量子退火器的抽样质量，与经典的Gibbs抽样进行了对比。尽管D-Wave覆盖了更多的谷值，但效果不显著，各种抽样技术存在一定互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨量子退火技术在受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）抽样中的效果，理解其优劣势，以寻找提升RBM训练质量的方法。

Method: 通过对经典RBM进行训练后，分别使用Gibbs抽样与D-Wave量子退火器进行抽样，分析其局部谷值分布和抽样质量差异。

Result: D-Wave在抽样多样性（如探索更多局部谷值）方面有所优势，但整体表现未显提高，尤其未能显著改善RBM的抽样质量；相反，不同技术对重要的局部谷值抽样互有覆盖。

Conclusion: D-Wave量子退火抽样技术未实现显著的RBM性能改进，但经典与量子结合的方法在未来可能带来潜在优势。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于LightGBM的机器学习模型，用于预测肝硬化患者在ICU中的急性肾损伤（AKI）风险，表现出高准确性和强解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化常导致急性肾损伤（AKI），严重影响患者预后，而目前预测工具在准确性和实际ICU应用中表现欠佳。因此，该研究旨在开发一种既准确又可解释的机器学习模型来实现早期AKI预测。

Method: 通过回顾性分析MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库，纳入1240名ICU肝硬化患者，并应用数据预处理、LASSO特征选择和SMOTE类平衡技术，训练了6种机器学习算法，包括LightGBM、CatBoost等，最终评估其预测性能。

Result: LightGBM模型性能最佳，AUROC达到0.808，具有很高的阴性预测值（NPV 0.911），核心预测因子包括凝血酶原时间延长、低pH值等，与肝硬化相关的急性肾损伤机制一致。

Conclusion: 基于LightGBM的模型准确且具解释性，可用于ICU肝硬化患者的AKI风险分层，支持低风险患者的安全措施和针对性预防措施。未来仍需外部验证及与电子健康记录系统的集成。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Conclusion: 本文验证了上文学习在加密解密中的潜力，证明了ICL在处理结构化推理任务中的优越泛化能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 当前变压器模型在CV和NLP领域表现卓越，但其易受后门攻击，而现有攻击方法通常需要耗时的重新训练或改变模型架构。

Method: HPMI通过剪去不重要的头，并注入预训练的恶意头，无需重新训练或改变模型架构，仅需少量数据即可实施攻击。

Result: 实验表明，HPMI在几乎不影响干净数据准确性的情况下，达到了至少99.55%的攻击成功率，并绕过了四种先进的防御机制。

Conclusion: 相比依赖重新训练的攻击方法，HPMI更具隐蔽性和鲁棒性，同时对干净数据的准确性影响最小。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线学习方法无法有效利用重复出现的迁移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉个体源组件，导致适配效果不佳。

Method: 通过理论分析，将问题分解为离线源组件分解和在线混合权重更新两个子问题。离线阶段利用EM算法基于过去的训练数据学习各个源组件预测模型；在线阶段通过凸优化更新预测模型的混合权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个实际回归数据集上的性能优于对比基线方法，可将累计测试损失降低多达67.4%。

Conclusion: 得益于深入的理论推导和方法设计，该方法充分利用迁移的特性，显著提升了适配效果，是处理源组件迁移问题的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

TL;DR: 文章提出一种符合预测框架，用以预测帕金森病患者未来两年的药物调整需求，通过提供精确预测及不确定性量化，改进现有试错方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前帕金森病治疗缺乏系统化的预测方法，医生需通过试错平衡症状控制与药物副作用，存在错误调整的风险。

Method: 利用含零通胀的电子健康记录数据，采用两阶段预测框架，首先筛选出可能需要调整药物的患者，再预测左旋多巴等效剂量调整额度，并提供置信区间和统计保证。

Conclusion: 该方法通过不确定性量化辅助医生优化帕金森病的药物管理决策，减轻副作用并提升患者生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时捕捉生物变异性和功能一致性，且解码性能受限于数据量。

Method: 引入SynBrain框架，包括BrainVAE（基于概率学习）和语义-神经映射器，以概率和功能一致的方法投射视觉语义到神经反应。

Result: SynBrain在特定对象的视觉到fMRI编码性能上超越现有方法，并有效应用于少样本条件下新对象的适应和高质量fMRI信号合成。

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅捕获了跨试验和个体的功能一致性，还揭示了生物神经变异性，信号合成表现出可解释模式，有望为神经科学研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出FedKEI，一种利用跨任务与跨客户机知识迁移来适应医疗新任务的联邦学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域快速发展的背景下，不同机构之间需要通过保护隐私的联合学习，一边基于过往经验快速适应新任务或新疾病。

Method: FedKEI利用跨任务与客户机间知识迁移，通过服务器的全球聚类过程优化集群权重，并基于双层优化方案进行知识个性化迁移。

Result: 在三种基准数据集上的实验表明，FedKEI在应对新疾病任务上优于目前的领先方法。

Conclusion: FedKEI提供了一种在联邦学习框架下通过知识转移提升医疗任务适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为CLIP-Fed的联邦学习后门攻击防御框架，通过结合前/后聚合防御策略和视觉-语言预训练模型实现对异质客户端数据分布的防御，同时有效抵抗后门攻击，并验证其优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习防御方法存在依赖同质客户端数据或清洁服务数据集的局限，而在异质客户端数据分布下有效抵御后门攻击成为一大难题。

Method: 提出CLIP-Fed框架，利用视觉-语言模型的零样本学习能力，构建多模态服务数据集，结合原型对比损失和KL散度对抗后门样本引起的类原型偏差，从而提升后门防御效果。

Result: 实验表明，CLIP-Fed在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-10-LT数据集上显著降低了平均攻击成功率（ASR），并提升了平均模型精度（MA），分别减少2.03%和1.35% ASR，同时提升7.92%和0.48%的MA。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed成功解决了联邦学习在异质客户端数据分布下的后门攻击防御问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于福利的公平聚类方法（welfare-centric clustering），结合距离和比例代表性建模组的效用，提出了两种优化目标并开发了相应算法，在实际数据集上的表现优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的公平聚类方法在确保群体代表性或平衡群体特定聚类成本方面存在缺陷，会导致不理想或直观的结果。因此，研究人员希望探索基于福利的聚类理念，以改进结果。

Method: 基于距离和比例代表性建模群体效用，并提出了Rawlsian（平等主义）和Utilitarian（功利主义）两种优化目标。随后，提出了全新的算法并提供理论保证。

Result: 新算法在多个真实数据集上的表现显著优于现有的公平聚类方法。

Conclusion: 基于福利的公平聚类方法在理论和实践上都表现出色，证明这一框架能够更好地满足公平性要求。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种分层入侵检测系统（IDS）框架，用于检测和区分零日攻击以及已知与未知的威胁。实验显示其对IoMT环境有很高的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗物联网（IoMT）的发展，其面临网络攻击的威胁（如拒绝服务、勒索软件、数据劫持及欺骗等）。集中式IDS因延迟、隐私风险和设备资源限制而不适用，因此需要一种更合适的方法。

Method: 提出了一个多层的IoMT IDS框架：第一层（近边缘）使用元学习及单类分类（例如usfAD算法）进行粗筛，辨别是否为攻击；后续层（远边缘与云端）进一步识别攻击种类及新颖性。

Result: 在CICIoMT2024数据集上的实验结果显示99.77%的准确率及97.8%的F1分数；第一层可高精度检测零日攻击，且无需新的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方案在资源有限的IoMT环境中表现出色，为医疗物联网提供了有效的安全保障，尤其是在面对未知威胁时的应对能力突出。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Motivation: 解决当前硬件加速框架未针对资源受限的边缘设备优化Mamba模型部署的问题。

Method: 通过替换复杂的归一化层为硬件友好的替代方案，近似计算高成本操作（如SiLU激活和指数运算），并结合近似感知NAS技术优化参数。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10、MARS数据集上显示出与最先进技术相当的准确性，并减少1.63-19.9倍的参数量。硬件实现上，相较基线解决方案，在延迟、吞吐量、面积、功耗和能耗方面均有大幅改进。

Conclusion: eMamba在维持准确性的同时，显著优化了硬件性能，适合资源有限的边缘平台部署，显示了对大规模自然语言任务的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个统一的评估框架，用来测量多标注者学习方法是否能真实捕捉个体标注倾向，并解释其行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多标注者学习主要关注从聚合标注数据生成单一真值预测，而缺乏对标注者个体倾向模型的评估框架来验证其效果。

Method: 提出了两个新颖的评估指标：差异化标注一致性（DIC）用以衡量模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力；行为对齐可解释性（BAE）用于评估模型解释与标注者行为的一致程度。

Result: 实验验证了所提出评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 评估框架为理解标注者决策和解释标注者行为提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前，LLM 推理面临内存需求和带宽限制问题，而计算能力的发展远超内存带宽。研究寻找新的算法以权衡计算与内存消耗。

Method: 提出 XQuant 方法，将层输入激活进行量化和缓存，并通过即用即生产的方式重构键值对，同时引入 XQuant-CL 利用跨层相似性实现极致压缩。

Result: XQuant 实现了高达 7.7 倍的内存节省，且困惑度仅下降 0.1，而 XQuant-CL 进一步实现 10 倍内存节省，仅 0.01 的困惑度变化。

Conclusion: XQuant 显著减少内存瓶颈，并超越现有 KV 缓存量化方法，成为未来硬件计算平台中高效 LLM 推理的重要工具。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly

### [246] [Unpacking the Implicit Norm Dynamics of Sharpness-Aware Minimization in Tensorized Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10435)
*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了利用Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)改进过参数模型泛化能力的研究，提出Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)方法获得了比SAM更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SAM在一般张量化或尺度不变模型中的行为及其对核心范数的偏差控制能力。

Method: 引入‘范数偏差’作为衡量核心范数不平衡的指标，通过梯度流分析推导SAM对范数偏差的隐式控制，设计了一种名为DAS的新方法模拟这种正则化行为。

Result: DAS在张量填补、噪声训练、模型压缩和参数高效微调中比SAM取得了更优或竞争性的性能，同时计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS通过数据自适应方式显性调整核心范数，改进泛化性能并减少计算成本，为SAM提供了一个有效替代方案。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

### [247] [RealAC: A Domain-Agnostic Framework for Realistic and Actionable Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10455)
*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出RealAC，一个用于生成现实可行的反事实解释的域无关框架，通过保持特征间复杂依赖关系和用户定义的约束来改进现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法过于依赖手工设置的限制或特定领域知识，且通常忽略用户偏好，造成生成不符合实际或不可执行的解释，从而限制其实用性和推广性。

Method: 提出RealAC框架，自动保持特征间的复杂依赖关系，无需显式领域知识，通过对齐事实与反事实样本的特征分布来实现，同时允许用户通过冻结特定特征来定义不可更改属性。

Result: 在3个合成数据集和2个真实数据集上，RealAC优于现有技术和基于大语言模型的反事实生成方法，在因果边得分、依赖保持得分和IM1现实指标上表现更佳。

Conclusion: RealAC为因果关系感知的用户中心反事实生成提供了一种更现实、更可行的解决方案，显示出良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

### [248] [X-Node: Self-Explanation is All We Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10461)
*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为X-Node的新型图神经网络(GNN)框架，可以生成自解释的节点级解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GNN在计算机视觉和医学图像分类领域表现出色，但其决策过程不够透明，在需要高度可信的临床应用中缺乏解释性。现有解释方法多为后处理和全局性的，难以提供单节点级别的解释。

Method: 设计了X-Node框架，使每个节点在预测过程中生成自己的解释。具体方法是构建一个上下文向量，编码解释性线索（如度数、中心性、特征重要性等），通过一个轻量级推理模块生成压缩解释向量，用于嵌入重建、自然语言解释生成、以及文本注入到GNN消息传递过程中。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST派生的两个数据集上，X-Node与GCN、GAT、GIN等后端结合后，保持了竞争性的分类精度，同时生成了忠实的单节点级解释。

Conclusion: X-Node框架在提供节点级别解释的同时，不牺牲分类性能，为GNN在高风险领域中的可信应用铺垫了基础。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

### [249] [GraphFedMIG: Tackling Class Imbalance in Federated Graph Learning via Mutual Information-Guided Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10471)
*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GraphFedMIG框架，通过联邦生成数据增强解决联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦图学习中，数据的统计异质性（特别是类别不平衡）会严重影响模型性能，这需要一种新的方法来减轻这些偏差。

Method: 提出了GraphFedMIG框架，使用层次生成对抗网络，每个客户端训练本地生成器生成高保真特征表示，并通过互信息引导机制优化生成器的参数。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG的性能优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG通过解决类别不平衡问题，显著提高了联邦图学习的性能，展示了其有效性和优势。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT可以通过持续模型适应性消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，显著提升准确性和效率，同时减少部署障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口由于神经信号随时间漂移和用户间差异导致准确性降低，经常需要重新校准，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EDAPT框架，首先对多个用户数据进行基线解码器的训练，然后通过监督微调持续个性化模型，并结合无监督领域适应性来改进性能。

Result: EDAPT在九个数据集和三种任务中均优于静态方法，呈现更高准确性，并能在消费者级硬件上高效运行，更新时间低于200毫秒。

Conclusion: 通过结合群体预训练和在线微调，EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实际可行的解决方案，降低了部署的主要障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中未观察到的混杂问题，该问题可能源自特征工程、A/B测试等实践，影响系统性能。

Method: 通过模拟研究和实际系统中的实例演示，分析不同实践如何引入混杂以及如何减轻其影响。

Result: 展示了推荐系统中常见实践带来的混杂现象及其对性能的负面影响。提供了减少混杂风险的实际建议和改进措施。

Conclusion: 标准实践可能引入混杂并影响推荐系统性能，需谨慎设计系统以避免问题。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决如何在满足约束的情况下，更高效地处理参数化优化问题及多车辆运动规划问题。

Method: 采用算子分裂方法进行快速投影，并利用隐函数定理进行反向传播，以此实现$Pi$net的设计并进行优化。

Result: $Pi$net在单一及批量问题上解决优化问题速度快于传统求解器，并在训练时间、解质量及超参数算法的稳健性方面优于现有学习方法。

Conclusion: $Pi$net成功融入多车辆运动规划任务，同时具有高效率、GPU适配性及有效调整启发式设计。

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着JEPAs技术的兴起，它比基于重建的方法更有效，因此本文希望将其用于基于观察数据创建世界模型。

Method: 结合序列嵌入和神经常微分方程（neural ODEs），通过使用收缩嵌入和Lipschitz常数，设计损失函数以构造结构化的潜在状态空间。

Result: 在仅使用图像数据的情况下，成功生成了一个用于简单摆的结构化潜在状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更通用的控制算法和估算技术（特别是在机器人领域中）提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的光谱框架，用于量化和分析解释的平滑性、忠实性及其权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ReLU网络在视觉数据解释中表现出噪声性和解释难度，而现有平滑方法牺牲了忠实性。

Method: 通过建立一个光谱框架，分析和正则化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献，并正式定义和测量平滑方法的“解释间隙”。

Result: 验证了ReLU网络中权衡机制的理论发现，并测试了不同设计、数据集和消融实验下的方法表现。

Conclusion: 提出了一种系统化分析解释平滑性和忠实性的新方法，量化权衡并定义了解释间隙。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Motivation: 一热编码在多分类任务中效果有限，传统ECOC方法又依赖手动或随机生成代码本，效率低下且可能不适用于特定数据集。

Conclusion: 通过自动代码本学习，能更高效适应数据，显著提升多分类问题下对抗攻击场景的表现，展示了方法的优越性。

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了MAGUS，一个模块化框架，统一了多模态理解和生成，通过认知和审议两个解耦阶段实现灵活性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当今多模态应用需要跨文本、图像、音频和视频的全面能力，但目前的模型难以在推理和高保真生成之间找到平衡。

Method: 使用MAGUS框架，分为两个阶段：认知阶段通过三个角色的LLM代理协同对话实现理解与规划；审议阶段整合增长感知搜索机制，以加强推理和生成。

Result: 实验表明MAGUS在多个基准测试上优于基线和当前最优系统，尤其在MME基准测试中超越了GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS提供了一种无需联合训练的可扩展多模态框架，支持模块化和语义对齐，展示了未来多模态系统设计方向。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了深度强化学习结合非局部蒙特卡洛算法在提升优化性能方面的潜力，对硬优化问题有显著改进作用。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时间修改采样以满足特定目标，但在多个预训练扩散模型间生成相关样本且满足任务约束方面仍有困难。

Method: PCD通过在生成动力学中引入耦合引导项以增强模型间的协调，并在每一步引入投影步骤以强制满足硬约束。

Result: 实验证明PCD在图像对生成、对象操作及多机器人运动规划中的有效性，展现出更好的耦合效果及约束满足能力，同时计算成本不高。

Conclusion: PCD方法在不需要重新训练模型的情况下，有效地解决了联合生成的难题，提供了一个新的高效框架。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 本文针对长期强化学习中的奖励稀疏问题，在软件工程任务中提出了一种名为Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA)的新方法，通过设定奖励门槛积累即时奖励，从而改进任务完成人数与修改率显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期强化学习任务中特别是软件工程任务中因奖励稀疏性和奖励错位造成的学习偏差问题，需要一种既能稳定优化又能避免奖励黑箱的新机制。

Method: 引入了面向软件工程的RL框架，支持多轮交互、基于Docker的执行以及自定义奖励函数，提出一种基于门控奖励积累（G-RA）方法，仅在高层奖励达到指标时累积即时奖励。

Result: 实验表明，在SWE-bench Verified和kBench任务中，G-RA方法使完成人数提升（从47.6%提高到93.8%、22.0%提高到86.0%），修改率提升（从19.6%提高到23.8%、12.0%提高到42.0%）。

Conclusion: G-RA方法在长期强化学习中有效平衡了奖励积累，同时避免了因奖励错位引发的策略退化，为复杂任务的强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CATE-B，一个结合因果推断和语言模型的开源辅助系统，用于自动化评估处理效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果效应估计技术因对因果假设、调整策略和模型选择的高专业要求而难以普及。

Method: 通过语言模型及因果发现构建结构因果模型，提出新颖的最小不确定性调整集，并根据因果结构和数据特性选择回归方法。

Result: 提供了一套跨领域和复杂因果结构的基准任务，验证了CATE-B的有效性。

Conclusion: CATE-B降低了因果分析的技术壁垒，为自动化处理效应估计提供了新基准的可能性。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

### [262] [GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为『统一学习』的新范式，通过将各种深度学习模型编码为图表示，在共享的图学习空间中进行统一优化，提高其在医疗影像领域的普适性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在面对医疗影像领域的领域分割场景（domain-fracture scenarios）时，难以应对因成像技术、协议、病人群体和设备差异导致的数据分布变化。每个医院需要根据本地数据训练特定模型（如MLPs、CNNs、GNNs），但不同架构间的协同训练及其泛化能力仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出将不同架构的模型转化为统一的图表示，并通过一个称为统一GNN（uGNN）的模型在图学习空间中优化模型的参数。此方法结合参数解耦和跨架构的知识迁移，以支持多种架构（MLPs、CNNs、GNNs）和分布之间的知识共享。

Result: 实验结果表明，在MorphoMNIST和两个MedMNIST数据集（PneumoniaMNIST、BreastMNIST）上的评估中，在训练数据分布与测试数据分布显著差异的情况下，应用统一学习的模型表现出了较强的鲁棒性，能有效提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 统一学习能够有效解决跨数据分布的异构架构协同优化问题，在医疗影像领域展示出良好的性能与鲁棒性。研究代码和基准已开放，支持进一步验证。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

TL;DR: 提出一种利用生成对抗变换器（GATs）的新方法，在没有高分辨率数据的情况下解决时间序列上采样问题，显著减少误差并提高应用精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上采样方法或丢失信息或增加噪声，而高级模型则受到训练需求等基础性挑战的限制。

Conclusion: 所提方法在无高分辨率数据条件下解决了上采样问题，具有显著的性能优化效果，表明其在能源系统模型领域的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Conclusion: FreeGAD通过无训练方式提供了高效、可扩展的图异常检测解决方案，为该领域的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Conclusion: 本文进一步形式化了深度网络分析的方法，为解释与设计更可靠的深度学习系统提供了新的思路与工具。

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves
privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate
output with a server. However, the distributed nature of SL introduces new
security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential
attacks. This paper systematically reviews various attacks on SL, classifying
them based on factors such as the attacker's role, the type of privacy risks,
when data leaks occur, and where vulnerabilities exist. We also analyze
existing defense methods, including cryptographic methods, data modification
approaches, distributed techniques, and hybrid solutions. Our findings reveal

Result: 实现了一种能够提升样本效率的多目标强化学习策略梯度方法，同时克服了当前方法的部分局限性。

Conclusion: 通过改进样本效率，论文为多目标强化学习的策略梯度方法提供了一种更具扩展性的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

*Lucas Cardoso,Vitor Santos,José Ribeiro Filho,Ricardo Prudêncio,Regiane Kawasaki,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 此研究提出利用项目反应理论（IRT）参数优化数据集划分，揭示数据实例的异质性，提高模型验证可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据划分方法忽略了实例的内在质量，对模型验证的鲁棒性产生影响，因此需要新的划分策略。

Method: 使用IRT参数分析数据集实例，根据其质量进行划分，创建更平衡的训练和验证集。

Result: 实验表明，IRT方法能够突出数据实例的异质性，高猜测参数实例会显著影响模型性能，部分划分的分类准确率从低于50%提高到超过70%。

Conclusion: 基于IRT的划分策略能够系统性地提高数据划分质量，有助于更好地理解模型的偏差与方差权衡问题。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion: 有效的模态融合策略及规避捷径学习对于复杂情感识别至关重要；通过MCIB模型验证了这一点，并显著提升了讽刺检测表现。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Conclusion: SPHENIC解决了现有方法的局限性，生成了高质量的空间嵌入，实现了更优的聚类效果。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

<details>

Motivation: 当前区域地球系统模型对高分辨率气候情景下的水文和大气过程预测能力逐步提高，但对其关键输入——土地利用与覆盖变化(LULC)预测能力明显滞后，限制了对未来环境风险的评估。

Method: 将LULC预测视为数据合成问题，使用生成式人工智能模型进行研究。具体地，训练扩散模型对未来十年的不透水面积进行预测，并与静态基线结果进行对比评估。

Result: 在12个城市的验证中，分辨率为$\geq 0.7\times0.7km^2$时，模型预测的平均绝对误差(MAE)低于静态基线，表明生成模型能够捕捉时间和空间的变化模式。

Conclusion: 研究验证了生成式模型在地表覆盖变化预测中的可行性和优越性，并提出进一步集成地球物理属性和考虑外部驱动变量以模拟不同情景的可能性。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主机补丁和网络过滤的防御方法不足以应对大规模设备部署中的漏洞威胁，尤其在设备多样性和延迟修复方面存在问题。

Method: 提出REFN框架，通过在线网络奖励驱动的强化学习训练大语言模型，生成网络过滤规则；采用一致性部署、在线验证和三种核心技术（知识蒸馏、语言到网络转换管道、在线验证）来增强模型的漏洞预防能力。

Result: REFN在22个漏洞家族中表现出高效性（准确率提升21.1%）、效率（修复平均耗时3.65小时）和可扩展性（支持1万台设备）。

Conclusion: REFN是训练大语言模型快速防御1 day或n day漏洞利用的一个初步尝试，并展示了其在大规模漏洞防御中的潜力。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

### [276] [Electromagnetic Simulations of Antennas on GPUs for Machine Learning Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10713)
*Murat Temiz,Vemund Bakken*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于GPU的开源电磁仿真框架，用于快速生成用于天线设计与优化的机器学习训练数据集，并证明其相比高端CPU计算性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在天线设计优化中需要大量训练数据，而传统基于电磁仿真的数据生产受限于高计算复杂度，效率低下，难以满足数据需求。

Method: 利用基于GPU的开源电磁仿真软件（gprMax）模拟天线结构，通过生成大量仿真数据支持机器学习模型的训练，并对不同机器学习模型进行天线参数估计性能比较。

Result: 使用入门级GPU显著超越高端CPU的计算性能，高端游戏GPU相比高端CPU性能提升约18倍；同时，开源软件在精细空间分辨率时的仿真结果与商业软件相近。

Conclusion: 基于GPU的电磁仿真能有效加速天线设计数据生产，降低成本，同时保持高精度，适用于机器学习与优化应用。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为APFL的个性化联邦学习方法，通过双流最小二乘解决非IID数据挑战，在多数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化联邦学习方法在非IID数据环境下表现不佳，影响了模型的集体泛化和后续个性化性能。

Method: 提出了APFL方法，利用基础模型作为特征提取器，并采用双流解析模型，其中主流用于全局泛化，次流用于本地个性化，其解析解具有异质性不变的特性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，APFL优于最先进的基线方法，准确度提高1.10%-15.45%。

Conclusion: APFL具备处理非IID数据的能力，同时实现了模型的全局泛化和个体个性化，显示出显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用Pass@k作为奖励指标训练强化学习模型，提高了模型的探索能力，并通过解析推导揭示了探索和利用互相增强的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法中使用的Pass@1奖励导致模型倾向于保守行动，容易收敛到局部最优。需要找到更适宜的奖励指标以平衡探索与利用。

Method: 提出使用Pass@k作为奖励来训练策略模型，并通过解析推导证明该方法的优势。此外，探索奖励设计对RLVR的影响及其潜在方向。

Result: 采用Pass@k奖励显著提升了模型的探索能力，同时分析表明探索与利用目标之间的潜在互补性。方法提高了训练效率和有效性。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training方法展现了在RLVR中的潜力，未来可通过设计优势函数继续优化探索与利用的平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Conclusion: Erwin NSA模型成功将稀疏注意力机制应用于大规模物理系统数据集，表现出良好的效率与扩展性，可作为优化Transformer模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBEX是一种应对蛋白-配体复合体数据稀缺问题的新型方法，通过PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论分析及精细优化，在结构药物设计中显著提升了分子生成与对接性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前三维生成模型在结构药物设计中受限于公开蛋白-配体复合体数据的稀缺性，现有方法难以学习可迁移的几何先验知识，并容易过拟合训练数据偏差。

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论评估样本信息密度，结合逐粗到精策略优化生成分子。引入基于物理的五项优化指标及六自由度翻译旋转优化。

Result: IBEX在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在CBGBench CrossDocked2020中将成功率从53%提高到64%，显著提升了Vina评分和QED，同时减少了外推误差。

Conclusion: IBEX通过改进生成与优化策略，在数据稀缺的情况下实现了更好的泛化能力和迁移性能，是结构药物设计领域的重要突破。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DECAF-GAD的新方法，解决了基于图神经网络的异常检测中的公平性问题，同时保持了良好的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于图神经网络的异常检测方法性能提升显著，但模型可能继承并放大数据中的偏倚，导致不公平结果。现有研究主要关注节点分类任务，而对采用更广泛的自编码器结构的公平性问题关注较少。

Method: 提出一种结构因果模型 (SCM) 来解耦敏感属性并设计了一种专门的自编码器架构及公平性指导的损失函数。

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据集上进行实验，证明DECAF-GAD在提高公平性指标的同时，能够保持与基线GAD方法相当的异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD框架在维持异常检测高性能的前提下，有效降低了因偏倚导致的不公平性，为基于图的异常检测领域提供了一种公平性保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Tlhey/decaf_code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RMAB算法假设每个臂的状态转移和奖励是固定的，这在真实应用中（如医疗和推荐系统）通常不成立，需要为非平稳动态设计新的方法。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的算法，将滑动窗口强化学习和上置信界机制结合，用于学习转移动态和变化幅度。

Result: 该算法达到了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 首次为非平稳在线多臂赌博机问题提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Result: 提供了选择在线高斯过程算法中合适准则的实用指南。

Conclusion: 通过对多个准则及其行为的综合分析，该研究为在线高斯过程的有效数据管理提出了明确建议，有助于解决数据流问题。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Result: 文章首次提供了一个结构化的视角，将数据最小化及其相关方法清晰地整合在一起，帮助从业者和研究者更好地应用这些原则。

Conclusion: 该工作统一了围绕数据最小化的研究视角，促进这一策略在人工智能和机器学习中的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

TL;DR: 此研究开发了一个名为\ourdataset~的新数据集，用于改善AI驱动的分子设计，通过增强模型的实验先验性以提升药物设计的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前药物设计AI模型常缺乏实验先验知识，可能导致生成的分子不符合隐性约束（如潜在毒性问题），研究动机在于解决这一重要问题。

Method: 构建一个\ourdataset~数据集，运用大型语言模型（LLM）管道从文献中提取实验先验，汇集包含SMILES或refseq IDs在内的3200多万条自然语言事实与实体表达对。此外，使用该数据集对LLM、CLIP和LLava架构进行训练，并在药物治疗数据集（TDC）任务中测试其性能。

Result: 通过\ourdataset~的预训练，包含1500万可学习参数的模型超越了大型2B TxGemma模型在回归与分类任务上的表现，且其性能与9B模型相当。此外，使用该数据集优化GuacaMol分子设计，生成的分子更安全且接近目标性能。

Conclusion: \ourdataset~为药物设计提供了强大的先验知识，显著提升模型在多项任务中的性能，并增强其在分子设计中对安全性和有效性的约束能力。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.
