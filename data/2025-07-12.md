### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种用于多模态实体链接（MEL）的新模型MMoE，通过解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，在多模态知识库中有效链接实体，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法难以处理提及歧义以及未能动态区分模态信息重要性的问题。

Method: 提出一种包含四部分的MMoE模型：描述增强模块、特征提取模块、以及分别用于信息选择的两层专家混合机制。

Result: MMoE方法在多项实验中表现优于现有技术，并提供公开代码便于验证。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择信息和增强上下文语义，有效改进了多模态实体链接的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），利用领域无关的文本嵌入来改进无监督领域适配中的语义分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中的标注收集比图像分类更困难，而目前基于文本的领域无关特性在分割任务中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了一种Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss (CoPT)，通过LLM生成领域模板，将源和目标域的描述输入冻结的CLIP模型，生成文本嵌入，以学习图像分割编码器中的领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试上，实验结果表明，使用CoPT训练的模型达到了无监督领域适配语义分割的新表现水平。

Conclusion: CoPT成功利用了文本的领域无关性质，实现了更好的语义分割领域适配性能，并达到了新的技术水平。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

Result: 实验表明，"Recall" 在攻击有效性、计算效率和语义保真度上胜过当前的方法，这揭示了现存反忘技术的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 用于模型反忘的现有机制具有显著的脆弱性，需更加坚固的解决方案以确保生成模型的安全及可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [5] [EEvAct: Early Event-Based Action Recognition with High-Rate Two-Stream Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07734)
*Michael Neumeier,Jules Lecomte,Nils Kazinski,Soubarna Banik,Bing Li,Axel von Arnim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高频双流尖峰神经网络（SNN），在实现高准确率的同时实现了早期活动识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足人机交互中的安全性和快速响应需求，现有方法因事件积累频率低而限制了早期预测能力，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种高频双流尖峰神经网络（SNN），能够以更高的频率处理事件，并在早期事件识别框架中对其进行基准测试。

Result: 在大规模THU EACT-50数据集上，提出的方法相较以往提高了2%的最终准确率，并在运动捕捉的实际任务中证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 高频双流尖峰神经网络（SNN）在早期活动识别和实际应用中展现了优越的性能，为事件感知的进一步研究提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

### [6] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文观察到了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视听任务中因模态冲突而产生幻觉的问题，并提出了一系列解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLLMs中由于不同模态输入间的内在冲突所引发的幻觉现象，为提高这些模型的稳健性提供新的视角。

Method: 构建了一个专用于模态冲突（MMMC）的数据集，并通过提示工程、监督微调和强化学习提出三种改进方法以缓解因模态冲突带来的幻觉问题。

Result: 通过实验发现，在缓解模态冲突引起的幻觉时，强化学习方法表现最佳，而监督微调方法则表现稳定且可期。

Conclusion: 本研究明确了模态冲突对于MLLMs产生幻觉的关键作用，提供了解决模态冲突的方法论基础，并促进了对MLLMs稳健性的更深理解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 文章研究了无人机在无GNSS的海洋环境中，通过视觉目标识别和定位方式进行船只识别的算法，并在实际竞赛中展示其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决无全球导航卫星系统(GNSS)环境中无人机如何有效完成海洋目标船只侦察与识别的需求，尤其在搜索救援和威胁探测等实际应用中提出解决方案。

Method: 使用YOLOv8目标检测模型检测视野内的船只，通过特征匹配及色调直方图距离分析确定目标船只，并利用几何原理定位目标。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中通过实际实验展示了方法的有效性，并在无GNSS导航系统下集成进全自主系统，同时分析了视角对检测准确性与定位精度的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的方法验证了在无GNSS环境下自主海洋监视与目标识别实现的可行性，并通过实验评估确保其实用性。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [8] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CL-Polyp，一种基于对比学习的算法，用于改善结肠镜图像中的息肉分割任务，并在多项基准数据集上实现了性能领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习息肉分割方法依赖于编码器-解码器框架或多任务学习，但这些方法对标注数据和任务相似性过度依赖，存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出了结合对比学习的网络CL-Polyp，通过对息肉图像生成正负样本对进行对比学习，以提升编码器的区分特征提取能力，引入了轻量级的MASPP和CA模块优化多尺度特征融合和边界重建。

Result: 在Kvasir-SEG等五个基准数据集上进行了实验，CL-Polyp在Kvasir-SEG和CVC-ClinicDB数据集上的IoU指标分别提升了0.011和0.020，表现优于最新方法。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp验证了其在临床息肉分割任务中的有效性，不仅提高了分割性能，还具备更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出通过EEG信号解码视觉体验的新方法，利用语义标签和预训练的生成模型生成图像，展现了EEG信号与高级语义层的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因EEG空间分辨率限制，难以通过EEG信号直接生成图像，论文目标是通过语义标签解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 构建基于transformer的EEG编码器，通过对比学习将脑信号映射到语义标签，再通过标签条件化预训练扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上达到当前最先进的可视化解码效果，提供了神经认知路径的可解释关联。

Conclusion: 论文表明结构化语义介导可以实现与认知对齐的EEG视觉解码，对脑信号解码及认知神经科学研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了32篇视频生成技术的论文，提出了全面的新分类法，并对现有方法按其结构设计和性能进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在生成多角色长时间视频时表现出一致性差和冗余帧问题，亟需改进以实现叙述连贯性和高保真度。

Method: 研究并归纳了32篇关于视频生成的论文，总结关键架构组件和训练策略，构建了一种新的全面分类法，并制作了比较表。

Result: 确定了能够提升视频生成的一致性和细节保真的关键设计组件与策略，同时对现有技术进行了分类和性能特点的系统比较。

Conclusion: 通过新的分类法和对比研究，为改进多角色长视频生成提供了清晰的方向和指南。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [11] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI)，一种利用颜色信息改进换装目标再识别的轻量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有换装目标再识别方法依赖额外模型或标注，资源消耗大。研究探讨通过前景和背景颜色减少外观偏差的可能性，且无需标注。

Method: 提出了CSCI方法，利用图像中的颜色信息进行分类，同时通过新型的S2A自注意力机制，避免颜色特征和身份特征之间信息泄露。

Result: 实验结果显示，CSCI方法在四个CC-ReID数据集上表现优异，其中图像ReID上的Top-1分别提高2.9%和5.0%，视频ReID上分别提高1.0%和2.5%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，颜色可作为有效且成本低的手段来应对CC-ReID中的外观偏差，展示了其在无额外监督情况下的良好性能。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究活动生物识别，通过提出一种具有结构化语言监督的多模态框架DisenQ，解决了传统生物识别方法在运动和外观变化下表现不佳的问题，并在多个数据集上实现了优越的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 活动生物识别面临运动动态和外观变化的挑战，使得身份特征的学习复杂化，现有的视觉数据辅助方法存在提取不准确问题。

Method: 提出了DisenQ，一个解耦查询转换器，通过融合结构化语言监督，有效从生物识别、运动和非生物识别特征中解耦身份信息，使其免受运动和外观变化的干扰。

Result: 在三个基于活动的视频基准测试中达到了当前最优性能，并在传统视频识别基准上也表现出很强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过语言引导的多模态框架，有效解决了活动生物识别中的身份特征提取问题，为复杂场景中的个体识别提供了一种可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LinguaMark基准，用于评估多模态模型在多语言视觉问答任务中的表现，涵盖11种语言和五种社会属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模多模态模型（LMMs）语言覆盖范围有限，输出具有偏见与不公平性，需要系统评估模型的多语言能力。

Method: 构建包含11种语言和5类社会属性的多语言VQA数据集，开发包括偏见、答案相关性和忠实性在内的评估指标，并对开源与闭源模型进行测试。

Result: 闭源模型在整体性能上表现最佳，开源模型（如Qwen2.5）在多种语言中具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 释放LinguaMark基准与评估代码，以促进研究社区的可重复性和进一步的研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Result: 实验表明，当前方法在多模态推理中的表现仍存在局限性，但也提供了改进的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为ADIEE的数据集创建方法，用于训练评分模型以用于指令引导的图像编辑评估，并在多个指标上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前开放式视觉语言模型评估存在对齐不足或透明性与成本效率不足的问题，且缺乏公开训练数据集来优化模型。

Method: 通过开发ADIEE自动数据集创建方法，生成了10万样本规模的数据集，并用于微调修改后的LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型，使其能够输出数值评分。

Result: 优化后的评分器在所有基准测试中优于开源VLM和Gemini-Pro 1.5，例如在人类评分相关性和成对比较准确性方面都有显著提升，并提高了某些模型在特定平台上的平均评分。

Conclusion: 该评分器不仅可以作为评估工具，还可用作奖励模型以自动选择最佳编辑和模型微调，展示了构建强大评估器的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理跨图像帧的实体和角色一致性时表现不佳，缺乏适当的训练方法。

Method: 提出了一种对比强化学习框架，包括负样本扩展和双组件奖励函数，用于优化实体定位和再识别能力并惩罚错误连接。

Result: 在多个指标上显著提升：实体定位准确率提高14.8%，F1评分增长17.1%，跨帧实体持续性提升了13.7%，连贯故事比例上涨了23.3%。

Conclusion: 对比强化学习方法显著提升了视觉语言模型的故事连贯性和实体连接能力，有助于未来视觉叙事任务的发展。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC是一种通过最小标注扩充数据多样性，提升深度补全泛化能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决训练通用深度补全模型对高成本大规模深度数据集的依赖问题。

Method: 通过探索2D到3D投影中的固有形状和位置一致性，使用多个深度基础模型生成具有多样场景尺度的伪几何数据，并结合插值、重定位策略和未标记图像扩展数据覆盖范围。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出色，在零样本和少样本场景中展现了卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PacGDC显著提高了通用深度补全模型的泛化性能，提供了低标注成本的新解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

Motivation: 现有方法欠缺自适应性，无法根据每个表面的局部几何特征调整粒子配置，从而难以准确表示复杂解剖变异性。

Method: 提出1)邻域对应损失以提高自适应性，2)测地对应算法以通过优化正则消除测地邻域一致性问题，并基于复杂数据集评估效果。

Result: 在表面表示精确度和对应性指标上，新方法优于现有方法，展现了其自适应性和扩展性优势。

Conclusion: 新方法在提高表面自适应性的同时保持了粒子配置一致性，对准确表示复杂解剖变异性具有潜在意义。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PES模型的时空感知能力不足，无法有效捕捉动作的短期和长期依赖关系以及显著的空间区域。

Method: 提出了MSAGSM模型，它通过多尺度时间扩张和多头空间注意力提升了现有的轻量时序模块性能，使模型能够同时对短期和长期依赖进行建模。

Result: 在五个PES基准上，MSAGSM以极少的计算开销显著提升了性能，并创造了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一个轻量、高效且易于集成的模块，为PES任务提供了更好的解决方案，同时TTA数据集丰富了该领域的研究资源。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架能在跨类别运动迁移中有效保存动物的独特习性特征，并具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Method: 提出Seg-Wild方法，结合3D高斯散射与多维特征嵌入，通过特征相似性实现交互式分割，并引入Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC)工具来平滑异常高斯，同时使用SAM遮罩优化高斯裁剪比例。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，Seg-Wild在“自然场景”分割和重建质量上表现更优。

Conclusion: 表现出色的Seg-Wild方法为“自然场景”图像集合分割提供了有效解决方案，并开源代码供研究者深入研究。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过多阶段和复杂管道完成无形补全和新视图合成，这种方法未考虑跨视图依赖性且计算开销过高。

Method: 采用输入级和特征级掩蔽微调来实现端到端模型，从而提高新视图合成和无形补全能力。同时，该方法可与其他图像到网格模型集成，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: EscherNet++不仅实现了更好的性能和效率，还展示了其对快速3D重建任务的可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Conclusion: EPIC有效解决了多模态模型在资源有限情况下的应用问题，兼顾效率与性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical
reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page:

Simple3D, an efficient framework integrating Multi-scale Neighborhood
Descriptors (MSND) and Local Feature Spatial Aggregation (LFSA) to capture
intricate geometric details with minimal computational overhead, achieving
real-time inference exceeding 20 fps. Extensive evaluations on MiniShift and
established benchmarks demonstrate that Simple3D surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in both accuracy and speed, highlighting the pivotal role of
high-resolution data and effective feature aggregation in advancing practical

*Ling Zhou,Runtian Yuan,Yi Liu,Yuejie Zhang,Rui Feng,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种名为DSANet的双语义感知网络，用于增强超声视频分割中的抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像通常会引入大量的噪声，对自动分割任务造成极大的挑战。

Method: 提出了两个模块：相邻帧语义感知模块（AFSA）通过通道相似矩阵实现帧间特征融合；局部和全局语义感知模块（LGSA）将局部空间细节特征与全局时间上下文特征融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，DSANet在四个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，不仅分割精度更高，同时实现了更高的推理帧率。

Conclusion: DSANet通过高效的模型设计解决了超声视频分割中的噪声干扰问题，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于颜色阈值技术和DCNN的影像算法，用于检测皮肤恶性黑色素瘤的蓝白色面纱（BWV）特征，并通过实验验证其显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是由于蓝白色面纱（BWV）作为诊断恶性黑色素瘤的重要特征，但在相关图像检测上研究有限，从而尝试改进检测方法。

Method: 使用非注释的皮肤病变数据集并通过一种基于颜色阈值的成像算法生成标注数据集；设计并训练深度卷积神经网络（DCNN），用自定义层替代标准激活函数层以检测BWV特征，并结合XAI解释模型决策过程。

Result: 提出的DCNN模型分别在多数据集上测试，表现出高于传统模型的性能，测试精度在多个数据集上达到85.71%-95.05%。

Conclusion: 结合人工智能与可解释性技术，建立了一种高效的BWV检测工具，为早期诊断黑色素瘤提供了可靠支持并显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Objectomaly的有物体性意识的改进框架，用于提升Out-of-Distribution (OoD) 图像分割的性能，通过结合多个阶段优化边界精度、统一异常评分，并利用对象级先验数据实现了新的SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的方法往往在边界精确性、对象内异常评分一致性以及背景噪声引发的误报上存在不足。因此需要一种改进的方法来解决这些问题，特别是在安全重要的自动驾驶等场景中。

Method: 提出Objectomaly框架，包括：(1) 利用现有方法进行粗略异常评分 (CAS)；(2) 基于SAM生成实例掩码的对象级别分数校准 (OASC)；(3) 使用拉普拉斯滤波和高斯平滑进行边界精确优化 (MBP)。

Result: 在OoD分割的主要基准上达到新的SOTA性能, 包括SMIYC的AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack以及RoadAnomaly，且在像素级（如AuPRC最高达96.99，FPR$_{95}$最低至0.07）和组件级（如F1$-$score最高达83.44）指标上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过消融实验和真实世界驾驶视频的定性结果进一步验证了方法的鲁棒性和通用性。代码将在论文发表后公开。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的基于GAN的盲人脸图像修复框架，包含局部统计面部特征转换（SFFT）模块与降解无关特征嵌入（DAFE）模块，显著改善恶劣天气下的人脸识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对恶劣天气对图像质量的影响，现有FIR模型限制在于缺乏专门模块处理天气导致的降解问题。

Method: 基于GAN，提出SFFT模块以改善面部结构和颜色准确性，和DAFE模块以在恶劣天气下提取鲁棒的面部特征，配合实现适应性恢复过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和重建面部结构方面优于现有的GAN和扩散模型方法，且在恶劣天气下能增强结构一致性和感知质量。

Conclusion: 所提框架显著优化了恶劣天气条件下的人脸图像修复性能，验证了模块的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体和用户上传的视频大量用于视觉对象追踪（VOT）的训练，但隐私问题被忽视，导致许多私人视频被未经授权使用。

Method: 提出一种生成式框架生成时序不可学习示例（TUEs），引入时序对比损失以增强效果，并通过高效计算实现对大规模视频数据集的可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频数据隐私保护中达到了最新的技术水平，并在多种追踪模型、数据集及任务中具有很强的可转移性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效阻止了未经授权的视频数据使用，同时确保了隐私保护在视频数据中的应用优势。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了关节之间的物理依赖性，增加了学习难度，容易生成不现实的运动。

Method: 提出使用组图动力-运动学网络，并引入了径向场和多尺度交互模块，同时结合等变多层感知器，更新关节位置特征，并通过辅助损失训练。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过增强动力-运动学建模提高了预测精度，并展示了其在捕捉人类运动物理依赖性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Conclusion: 新方法无需依赖线性混合蒙皮或刚体约束，即可实现高质量动态场景重建及平滑运动一致性。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的不可见推理瓶颈问题及其根源。

Method: 引入线性可分性上限（LSC）指标，分析VLMs在需推理任务中的表现，并通过分析现有模型推理路径与权重调整对性能的影响，验证模型内隐藏的潜在推理能力。

Result: 发现大部分推理瓶颈源自语言模型推理路径的失败，而非视觉特征表达的限制；此外，抽象推理需要具体的模型权重适配，而语义任务则可通过激活现有路径解决。

Conclusion: 模型推理能力的提升需基于目标任务的针对性对齐，而非仅限于改进表示学习。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS框架通过创新性地结合知识蒸馏与几何先验，解决了弱监督低光照语义分割的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

Abstract: This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection
framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:

effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HOTA方法和一个完整的3D洪水制图流程，充分利用多尺度推理和高程信息来绘制精确且大范围的3D洪水图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最常见的自然灾害之一，其迅速的影响评估和反应至关重要，但现有洪水制图在覆盖范围与深度表示上有所权衡，亟需改进。

Method: 提出HOTA：分层重叠平铺聚合的多尺度推理方法，并结合SegFormer和双约束深度估计模块，仅在推理时对多光谱Sentinel-2影像进行处理，利用高程模型推断洪水深度。

Result: 在澳大利亚Kempsey洪水案例中，HOTA结合SegFormer提升了IoU从73%提高到84%，并在3D洪水表面中实现了边界误差小于0.5米的表现。

Conclusion: HOTA提供了一种高精度、大面积的快速3D洪水制图方法，适用于灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于扩散的方法虽在生成多样复杂的发型方面表现出色，但在生成一致且高质量的多视图结果方面仍有待改善，这是实现真实场景应用的关键。

Method: 设计了一个全面的多视图训练数据生成流程，包括扩散模型驱动的Bald Converter、数据增强修补模型和面部微调的多视图扩散模型，以生成高品质的三元组数据。模型整合了极角嵌入实现姿态条件化和时间注意力层以保证视图平滑过渡，并采用多阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2为多视图头发迁移设立了新的基准，在提供高保真度和视图一致性的同时满足真实应用需求。

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在驾驶场景中利用图像-文本模型进行激光雷达点云的开放词汇分割，旨在解决传统方法中标签噪声和稀疏的问题。

Method: 将图像语义反投影到3D点云上，通过加强时空一致性和图像级别增强的鲁棒性对标签进行巩固，然后用这些标签训练3D网络。

Result: 提出的LOSC方法在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI数据集上的开集零样本语义与全景分割任务上显著超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 通过简化方法和强调数据一致性，LOSC证明了对开放词汇分割任务的有效性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个新的名为SpatialViz-Bench的基准测试，用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的空间可视化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大型语言模型在空间可视化能力方面的评估较少，并且现有评估方法（如IQ测试）可能与训练数据有重叠，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出SpatialViz-Bench这一包含12项任务和1,180个自动生成问题的综合性多模态基准测试，评估33种最先进MLLM的空间可视化能力。

Result: 评估结果揭示了模型性能的显著差异，展现了基准强大的区分能力，并发现多个与人类直觉不一致的模型行为，例如从2D到3D表现急剧下降。

Conclusion: 研究显示，最先进的MLLM在空间可视化任务上仍表现出显著缺陷，为该领域填补了重要空白，并公开提供了基准测试。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Motivation: 目前视觉-语言模型在不确定性量化和失败预测方面仍存在挑战，尤其是在只提供图像和文本嵌入的情况下无法有效处理。

Method: ViLU通过交叉注意力，结合视觉嵌入、预测的文本嵌入和图像条件的文本表示，形成不确定性感知多模态表示。并使用加权二元交叉熵损失训练一个不确定性预测器作为二元分类器来区分预测的正确与否。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k、CC12M和LAION-400M等多样化数据集上的实验表明，与现有方法相比，ViLU在失败预测及不确定性量化上具有显著提升，且适用于后处理设置。

Conclusion: 实验和消融研究验证了ViLU架构和训练方式在实现有效不确定性量化上的重要性。代码已公开分享，供公众使用。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成性视频编码框架（T-GVC），通过语义感知的稀疏运动采样和轨迹引导扩散过程，在超低码率下实现了更高质量的视频重建，尤其是在运动控制的精确性上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成编码技术在超低码率下的重建效果常受限于领域特异性或过度依赖文本引导，导致运动细节丢失和生成效果不真实。

Method: 提出了一种轨迹引导生成性视频编码框架（T-GVC），通过语义感知的稀疏运动采样提取基于语义重要性的像素级运动轨迹点，同时结合轨迹对齐损失约束的扩散过程引入无训练的潜空间引导机制，以确保运动合理和生成效果优良。

Result: 实验证明，T-GVC框架在超低码率条件下超过传统编解码器和最先进端到端视频压缩方法。此外，该方法在运动控制精确性上显著优于现有的文本引导方法。

Conclusion: T-GVC框架为几何运动建模引导的生成性视频编码开辟了新思路，有望在超低码率场景下实现语义和运动细节俱佳的视频重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Motivation: 现有的人脸表情识别系统对年龄存在偏差，特别是对老年人，这影响了模型的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 利用解释性AI技术分析表情识别和模型关注模式中的年龄相关偏差，并提出三种减轻偏差的策略：多任务学习、多模态输入和基于年龄加权的损失函数。

Result: 通过在大规模AffectNet数据集上训练和测试，结果表明老年人表情识别的准确性得到提升，尤其是“中性”“悲伤”和“愤怒”表情。同时，模型更关注各年龄组的相关面部区域。

Conclusion: 仅通过简单的训练修改即可有效减轻表情识别模型中的年龄偏差，且即使仅使用大致准确的人口统计标签，也能促进情感计算系统的公平性。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物作用机制（MoA）研究对药物发现和临床应用非常关键，而现有方法仅关注空间特征，忽略了活细胞的时间动态特性。同时，药物分子本身的模态信息可以与影像模态互补，提供更全面的特征信息。

Method: 提出了MolCLIP视觉语言模型，将显微细胞视频和药物分子模态结合起来，通过分子辅助的CLIP框架引导视频特征的学习，并融入度量学习策略以优化视频特征的聚合效果。

Result: 在MitoDataset实验中，MolCLIP在药物识别上的mAP提升了51.2%，在MoA识别上的mAP提升了20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过充分利用细胞视频的时间动态特性与分子模态的互补信息，高效提升了药物作用机制预测的性能，展示出在药物研究领域的前景。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Motivation: 当前动态面部表情识别研究重点关注深度学习特征，但缺乏对动作单元（AU）在面部表情中的作用的有效利用。

Method: 通过设计权重矩阵量化动作单元对表情的贡献，并结合AU损失函数将先验知识整合进传统深度学习网络。

Conclusion: 首次将量化的AU表情知识融入动态面部表情识别模型，并提出多样化损失函数设计策略以解决数据失衡问题，有效提升DFER整体表现。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉-语言模型在多模态推理中受Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法启发，但现有方法中模型常会忽视生成推理的内容，影响推理准确性。

Method: 将多模态CoT推理形式化为一种基于KL约束的奖励最大化问题，并提出Rationale-Enhanced Decoding（RED）作为其解决方案，通过结合图像条件和推理条件的下一词分布，提高推理精度。

Result: 实验表明，自提出的RED方法相较于标准CoT和其他解码方法，在多个测试集和模型上均显著提升了推理表现。

Conclusion: RED提供了一种现实且有效的方法，增强了大规模视觉-语言模型的推理可靠性和准确性，为更可靠的多模态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于掩码预测和帧内运动分析的图像去模糊方法，能够有效解决局部运动模糊问题，同时提升计算资源利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去模糊方法在处理空间变化模糊模式时存在资源分配低效和方法不够完善的局限性，本研究旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种可训练的掩码预测器用于检测模糊区域，并结合3×3卷积的结构重参数化优化计算效率。同时，开发了帧内运动分析器，通过像素位移生成运动轨迹，提供区域自适应的模糊恢复指导。

Result: 在多个数据集中，提出的方法在局部模糊和全局模糊实验中表现优于最新方法，同时减少了49%计算量（如对比于LMD-ViT模型）。

Conclusion: 新方法有效提升了局部运动模糊问题的处理性能和计算效率，并公开了代码，方便进一步研究。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: 本文提出CrossVLAD数据集和CRAFT方法，旨在评估和改进统一视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的跨任务对抗性攻击性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉-语言模型具备通过不同指令处理多样任务的能力，但其基于指令的控制机制容易受到跨任务对抗性攻击的威胁。本研究旨在系统评估和提高VLMs在该方面的安全性。

Method: 提出CrossVLAD数据集，结合GPT-4批注以评估跨任务对抗性攻击，并通过对象分类一致性操作评价各种结果。同时设计了CRAFT区域基攻击框架，结合Token对齐技术提升攻击效率。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 旨在解决长视频推理中的独特挑战，例如复杂的时间、目标、和空间推理需求，进一步推动VLM在长视频领域的发展。

Method: 提出1) 一个大规模的长视频问答数据集LongVideo-Reason, 2) 两段式训练方法：CoT-SFT和强化学习，3) 名为MR-SP的高效长视频RL训练基础设施。

Result: LongVILA-R1在多个长视频问答基准上表现优越，并实现了RL训练速度最高2.1倍的提升。此外，性能随输入视频帧增长而持续提高。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1有助于提升VLM在长视频推理领域的性能，标志着这一方向的重要进展。同时，公开的训练系统为多模态与生成模型的强化学习提供了支持。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

Motivation: 针对现有领域缺乏全面评估视觉区域推理能力的基准问题，研究旨在填补这一空白，提出检测和标准化视觉推理路径的重要性。

Method: 提出了TreeBench基准测试，包含具有复杂视觉和高密度场景的问答对，结合三阶段质量控制筛选得到405个挑战性的问答对。此外，提出TreeVGR训练范式，通过强化学习同时监督视觉定位和推理能力。

Result: TreeBench基准测试中，当前先进模型的精度未能超过60%，例如OpenAI-o3仅达到54.87%。利用TreeVGR训练的模型在多个基准上提升显著，其中在TreeBench基准上提升了+13.4%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了可追踪性对于提升视觉推理能力至关重要，提出的新基准和新范式为领域提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 旨在解决Segment Anything Model在3D医学图像分割中推理复杂性高和计算资源要求高的问题。

Method: 借鉴SegVol的灵感，提出了一种简化的3D可提示分割算法，避免滑动窗口推理策略带来的复杂性。

Result: 解决了现有方法对计算资源的高需求，同时实现了更低的推理时间和顶尖的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了3D医学影像分割过程，能够快速实现高效且性能卓越的分割结果，适合3D体积数据处理需求。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中的对象幻觉偏差，确保其安全部署。

Method: 提出一种基于能量的解码方法，根据最小能量分数动态选择隐藏层状态，减少'Yes'比例的偏差，同时提升模型表现。

Result: 在三个视觉问答数据集上，实现准确度和F1分数较基线方法分别提升4.82%，并减少8.81%的'Yes'比例偏差。

Conclusion: 所提方法在减少解码偏差的同时，显著提升模型性能，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖预训练模型的最终层特征，缺乏对新领域的适应能力，同时忽略了MR任务的稀疏特性。

Method: 提出稀疏-稠密侧调节（SDST）框架，引入基于参考的可变形自注意力机制，并首次将InternVideo2主干网络整合至侧调节框架中。

Result: 显著提升了现有方法的性能，在QVHighlights、TACoS和Charades-STA数据集上达到SOTA或竞争性结果，同时参数量减少了最高73%。

Conclusion: SDST框架有效解决了现有方法的不足，展现了出色的性能与参数效率，是一种创新的VTG任务解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

Motivation: 由于非限制性对抗攻击并不受传统的范数约束，且当前缺乏规范化方法对其进行评估，该论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包括人群研究指南、大规模人类与模型对比研究、开源软件工具以及ImageNet衍生数据集，用以测试、评价和比较非限制性对抗攻击效果。

Result: 研究发现，三种颜色空间攻击和三种基于扩散的攻击未能生成不可察觉的图像；GPT-4在某些攻击中可初步检测，但并不一致。

Conclusion: 当前自动化视觉系统与人类感知存在显著差距，需要基于SCOOTER的真实数据集评估标准。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Conclusion: 校准前的模型集成比后处理更有效；校准结合微调与模型集成可获得最佳鲁棒性，尤其对于校准抵抗偏移具有积极意义。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: 提出S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，专注语言引导的3D场景空间推理分割，填补当前研究在空间推理能力上的空白，并提供了基准测试证明其挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言和3D感知的整合研究中，空间推理能力仍未被充分探索，而现有数据集经常混淆语义线索与空间上下文，导致模型依赖表面捷径而非真正理解空间关系。

Method: 构建了S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，包含超20万语言-视觉对，89k+无物体名称的人工标注空间查询，覆盖相对位置、叙述视角、参数化视角和绝对距离推理等多种空间推理技能，用于更好评价语言引导的空间推理分割。

Result: 基准测试表明当前最先进的3D视觉定位方法和3D语言模型在此数据集上的表现仍存在显著挑战，验证了数据集和相关基准测试套件的必要性。

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D及其基准测试套件旨在推动空间感知AI的发展，为有效的机器人交互及规划铺路。

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种端到端的非接触式遥测光电容积图（rPPG）提取网络，通过三维卷积神经网络从面部视频中重建高精度的rPPG信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在复杂场景下精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力不足，因此需开发更适应复杂环境的模型。

Method: 引入差分帧融合模块结合差分帧和原始帧以捕捉血容变化，采用带自注意力机制的时间偏移模块提升rPPG特征，并设计动态混合损失函数以减少过拟合。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG及具有挑战性的MMPD数据集上实验表明，所提模型在鲁棒性和泛化能力上优于现有模型。特别是在MMPD测试集上，MAE达7.58，超过最新模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过融合多种先进技术显著提升了rPPG信号提取的性能，适用于复杂场景下心率测量。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT)的新方法，通过结合实例级和数据集级提示信息，优化视觉提示在视觉变换器中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉提示调优方法由于对所有输入实例使用相同的提示信息，无法应对下游数据集中高方差的问题，因此需要一种能够区别对待不同输入实例的优化方法。

Method: ViaPT提出基于每个输入生成实例级提示信息，并通过主成分分析（PCA）优化与数据集级提示的结合，同时减少可训练参数。

Result: 在34个多样化的数据集中，ViaPT在性能上均超过了现有的最先进基线方法，并降低学习参数的同时实现性能优化。

Conclusion: ViaPT通过平衡数据集级和实例级知识，开创了一种新的视觉提示分析与优化范式。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Synergistic Prompting (SyP) 的新框架，用于在多模态缺失的条件下实现稳健的视觉识别。通过动态适配器和协同提示策略，显著提升了模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，多模态输入经常会出现缺失或不完整，这会导致现有大规模多模态模型的性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了协同提示(SyP)框架，包括动态适配器（动态生成提示）和协同提示策略（结合静态和动态提示）。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的视觉识别数据集上，SyP框架在各种缺失率和条件下表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: SyP框架在处理多模态输入缺失方面展现出了卓越的适应性和可靠性，对增强实际应用中的视觉识别性能有重要意义。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究设计了一种基于视图转换器（ViT）的无标记肺部肿瘤运动预测方法。通过患者特定（PS）和多患者（MP）两种策略，在临床约束条件下进行性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标记方法大多依赖深度学习，本文旨在探讨尚未被应用于此领域但在轨迹预测中表现出色的Transformer模型，并解决肿瘤运动精确预测中的临床需求。

Method: 作者使用视图转换器（ViT）对肺肿瘤运动进行预测，分别设计患者特定（PS）模型和多患者（MP）模型；模型基于四维CT数据生成的DRR图像进行训练，并评估1秒钟内的肿瘤运动预测精度。

Result: PS模型在规划数据（T1）上表现优于MP模型，但MP模型在处理治疗数据（T2）时表现出更强的鲁棒性和无需重新训练的特性，适合在时间限制的临床场景中使用。

Conclusion: ViT首次被应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测，提供了高精度（PS模型）和鲁棒性（MP模型）的权衡方法，对时间受限的临床治疗特别有用。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有拼图求解算法的评估缺乏与实际应用相关的挑战，如碎片化文物或文件的重组。本研究旨在填补这一空白，测试算法在面对现实场景中复杂条件下的性能。

Method: 引入三种拼图破坏（缺失块、边缘破损、内容腐蚀），评估了启发式和深度学习拼图求解算法的鲁棒性，分析其在不同条件下的性能差距。

Result: 标准拼图算法在面对较多破坏时表现迅速下降，而深度学习模型通过额外的调优和数据增强，展现出更好的适应性。其中，Positional Diffusion模型在多数实验中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了当前拼图求解算法的局限性，并提出了通过数据增强来提升算法在真实世界拼图重组任务中鲁棒性的潜力。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的CIS方法存在“可塑性丧失”和对输入数据顺序严重依赖的问题。

Method: 通过分析内置对象性，提出SimCIS方法，该方法通过特征选择实现查询任务分配，结合跨阶段一致性和视觉查询机制，增强了分类的记忆能力。

Result: SimCIS在多种分割任务中效果优于现有的最先进方法，并具有数据顺序鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SimCIS实现了对类别增量图像分割的有效解决并显著提升了准确率，其代码将开源以供研究者使用。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Motivation: 目前的自动化缺陷检测方法在真实制造环境中表现有限，而现有数据集无法很好地代表工业场景，阻碍了改进方法的开发。

Method: 构建了一个包含217种零件、27,346个缺陷实例和8,110个机械特征的真实工业环境数据集，涵盖真实场景中的灯光、遮挡等复杂变量。

Result: 在多种RGB+3D异常检测任务上评估现有最先进模型时，数据集表现出显著挑战性。此外，进行了一项工业专家标注调查验证了数据集的工业相关性和质量。

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为开发能够满足现代制造环境需求的鲁棒模型提供了一个具有挑战性的新基准，旨在促进更为先进的3D异常检测技术的发展。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Motivation: 现有基于像素的扩散图像修复方法计算量大，同时对具有复杂几何和显著深度变化的场景表现出不真实的伪影，需要一种有效且处理速度快的方法来解决复杂场景中的水下图像修复问题。

Result: SLURPP在合成和真实数据上的基准测试中表现出了最先进的性能，相比现有扩散方法速度提高了200倍，同时在PSNR上提高了约3 dB，对真实场景的数据也有显著提升。

Conclusion: SLURPP方法显著提升了水下图像修复的准确性和效率，为复杂场景图像恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Motivation: 现有多模态语言模型在医疗诊断中虽有进步，但在事实一致性上存在问题，需通过优化检索增强技术来提高准确性。

Method: 设计MIRA框架，包含两个关键组件：重思与重排模块动态调整检索内容量，以及一个结合图像嵌入和医疗知识库的医学RAG框架，实现高效多模态推理。

Result: 在公开的医疗问答和报告生成基准测试中，MIRA大幅提升了事实准确性和整体性能，取得了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: MIRA框架通过集成模型内外知识优化医疗多模态推理，成功应对了现有方法的检索不足与依赖问题，提升了多模态语言模型的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

*Juan Pablo Oberhauser,Daniel Grzenda*

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型通常未能捕捉来自3D世界的几何结构，该研究意图弥补视频扩散模型与物理世界三维本质之间的差距。

Method: 通过引入Geometry Forcing方法，指导模型的中间表示朝向几何感知结构发展，利用两个对齐目标（Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment）与预训练的几何模型特征对齐。

Result: 在视角条件和动作条件的视频生成任务上，该方法在视觉质量和三维一致性方面明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing方法提高了视频扩散模型的三维结构感知能力，为相应生成任务提供了性能提升。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基准难以评估多模态大模型在在线场景中的复杂时空推理能力，为了更贴近现实世界的需求，提出了OST-Bench。

Method: 构建了OST-Bench，它包括来自多种数据源的场景和问答数据，并对多模态大模型在在线探索场景中的表现进行评估，旨在测试模型的时空综合能力和长期记忆能力。

Result: 论文指出目前的多模态大模型在复杂时空推理任务中表现不佳，尤其在在线探索过程中，随着任务扩展表现进一步下降。还发现了模型在时空推理与记忆检索方面的主要错误模式。

Conclusion: 研究证明当前的多模态大模型在在线时空任务中仍有明显局限，并提出OST-Bench作为促进该领域进一步研究和发展的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

### [87] [CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985)
*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP模型在学习绑定问题上的局限性，并通过构造合成数据集研究数据属性对CLIP绑定性能的影响，发现特定数据属性对于提升绑定性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中显示出广泛应用价值，但其对绑定关系的理解存在局限性，难以区分描述复杂情景中的细节关系，因此研究其局限性尤为重要。

Method: 通过合成数据集，深入分析数据属性（如属性密度、描述完整性等）对CLIP模型绑定能力的影响，观察不同属性如何影响模型性能。

Result: 发现自然数据中的低属性密度、不完整的描述以及描述倾向性等特性会阻碍CLIP学习绑定。同时，仅通过扩大批量大小或引入额外负样本并不能改善绑定效果，只有数据满足特定属性，才能大幅提升绑定性能。

Conclusion: 有效解决CLIP的绑定问题需从数据属性入手，构建具有高质量描述和适当密度的数据对于模型绑定能力的提升至关重要。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章旨在解决视频大语言模型中因时空标记数量增加而导致的计算效率下降问题。

Method: 使用局部的时空冗余进行多粒度空间标记转换和时空维度的逐对合并，形成一种基于四叉树结构和查询不可知的KV缓存复用方法。

Result: STTM在六个视频问答基准上表现优于现有方法，减少50%的标记量时实现2×加速，仅有0.5%的准确率下降；减少70%标记量时实现3×加速，且仅有2%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: STTM有效降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了优良的性能，体现了其在大型视频理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑视觉解码的评价标准过于粗糙，缺乏神经科学基础，无法捕捉细粒度的视觉差异。

Method: 提出BASIC评价框架，通过结构保真性、推理一致性和上下文连贯性多方面评估解码与原图的差异，同时设计多种分割和语义级别的对比指标。

Result: 在多种刺激-神经影像数据集上，基于BASIC框架对多种视觉解码方法进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: BASIC框架提供了一种更加具有区分性、可解释性和全面性的脑视觉解码评价方法。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够成功应对少量数据训练场景下的跨模态嵌入和草图风格变化问题，为少样本学习提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KARL的单次自适应图像分词器，基于Kolmogorov复杂性原理实现高效的数据压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统通常采用固定长度表示，忽略了输入复杂性或熟悉度的差异，而现有的自适应分词方法需要测试时进行多编码搜索，效率低下。

Method: 基于Kolmogorov复杂性原理，设计了KARL分词器，通过单次前向传递预测图像所需的适当分词数量，类似于Upside-Down强化学习，条件预测停止分词以达到所需的重建质量。

Result: KARL单次操作即可匹配现有自适应分词器性能，并提供有关缩放定律的研究分析。

Conclusion: KARL不仅提高了自适应分词效率，还在图像复杂性预测方面与人类直觉一致，并将自适应图像分词与算法信息理论进行了概念类比。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Conclusion: 提出的\NickName方法显著增强了VQ-VAE模型的重建能力，为高清图像处理任务中的保真度提供了基础支持。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,

TL;DR: 研究揭示了CLIP和大型多模态模型（LMMs）在训练数据中概念组合对组合式泛化能力的影响，突出了一种改进模型泛化能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CLIP和LMMs在训练数据中高频的概念上表现优秀，但关于概念组合（如常见对象与罕见对象的配对）对模型性能的影响尚不明确，研究希望解决这一未知问题。

Method: 通过分析CLIP预训练数据中的单词共现统计（使用点互信息PMI衡量），结合合成图像和自然图像数据，对概念对的组合与CLIP/LMM性能的关系进行测试和验证。

Result: 发现PMI与CLIP零样本准确率存在显著相关性（例如：PMI值排名前5%和后5%图像间有14%的准确率差异），并证实了这种行为在其他自然图像和基于CLIP的高级LMM任务（TextVQA、VQAv2）中转移的相关性。

Conclusion: 现有方法在提升组合泛化能力方面存在局限性，研究呼吁开发能够无需呈指数性扩展训练数据却能改进组合式泛化能力的算法和架构。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs)中认知偏见的成因，发现这些偏见主要由预训练阶段决定，而非微调数据或随机性因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型中的认知偏见现象，解析其起源，指导未来模型的偏见评估与减轻。

Method: 采用两步因果实验方法：1. 使用不同随机种子多次微调模型，研究训练随机性对认知偏见的影响；2. 提出跨数据集微调方法，区分偏见的来源。

Result: 研究表明，虽然训练随机性会引入一定变异，但偏见主要由预训练阶段决定；具有相同预训练骨干的模型偏见模式更相似。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型中的偏见需更多关注预训练阶段的偏见成因，为减轻偏见提供指导方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

TL;DR: SynthTextEval 是一个评估合成文本的工具包，涵盖下游系统效用、公平性、隐私泄漏风险等多维度评估，适用于高风险领域如医疗和法律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型生成文本的流畅性提高，合成文本在隐私保护和AI高风险领域的应用中具有潜力。然而，需要一致的多维度评估以确保其实用性、公平性及隐私安全性。

Method: 开发了 SynthTextEval 工具包，用户可上传或通过工具包生成合成数据，并在多个维度（效用性、公平性、隐私性等）进行评估，尤其针对医疗和法律领域数据。

Result: 展示了工具包在高风险领域数据评估中的功能及有效性，通过标准化评估指标改进了合成文本的实用性和隐私保护能力。

Conclusion: SynthTextEval 统一了合成文本评估指标，有望提升合成文本在隐私保护和AI开发中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型性能的提升，其在医疗领域的应用逐渐增多，但这种应用可能会对用户的健康安全产生直接影响，特别是患者和临床医生等不同用户角色的需求差异突出。

Method: 提出了一套专注于医疗领域的安全评估协议，包括患者和临床医生视角的安全评估标准，以及通用安全性分析。同时构建了一个名为PatientSafetyBench的数据集，用于评估患者视角的安全性。并以MediPhi模型集合为案例，应用了红队测试协议。

Conclusion: 该工作首次从患者、临床医生和普通用户的不同视角定义了医疗大语言模型的安全评估标准，为模型在医疗领域的安全部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

Method: 分析了单一对话和多小组对话场景下的中断检测，设计了一种对重叠语音鲁棒的中断识别方法，并结合语言学和韵律信息进行探讨。

Result: 提出了可在课堂部署的最先进中断识别方法，并深入展示了中断在合作小组互动中的表现特征。

Conclusion: 研究为解决多小组重叠语音对话场景中的中断检测提供了技术支持，同时为日后进一步研究提供了方向指引。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

Conclusion: 实验和以人为基础的评估均表明该框架在生成高质量反驳性言论方面表现出色，并获得更高的人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer模型在处理长文本时效率低下，需要一种新的方法。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，并引入实时生成图机制，无需填充或截断，结合大语言模型信息，构建了紧凑高效的模型。

Conclusion: 该模型在多项任务中表现良好，验证了其实用性与性能优势。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI在医疗部署中的人机交互问题，尤其是生成内容既个性化又易理解这一需求。

Method: 设计了一个名为MedReadCtrl的可读性控制框架，通过调控LLMs的输出复杂度，实现了对内容个性化和易理解性的控制。

Result: MedReadCtrl在9个数据集和3个任务上的表现优于GPT-4，并在未见临床任务中取得显著提升，例如ReadMe数据集上的可读性错误更低，临床任务中的ROUGE-L和SARI分数也显著提高。同时专家更倾向于选择MedReadCtrl所生成的文本，尤其是在低识字水平情况下。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能够将复杂的医学内容转化为易读语言，同时保持医学意图，为患者教育和公平医疗的AI应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Motivation: 驱逐是重要但被低估的健康社会决定因素，研究的动机是解决其在未结构化电子健康记录中难以提取和编码的问题，促进下游应用的开发。

Method: 开发了SynthEHR-Eviction管道，结合LLMs、人机协作注释和APO技术，从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建一个包含14个精细分类的数据集，并微调LLMs以改进性能。

Result: 微调的大型语言模型（如Qwen2.5、LLaMA3）在数据集上达到了88.8%（驱逐）和90.3%（其他SDoH）的宏F1分数，优于其他模型，同时减少了超过80%的注释工作量。

Conclusion: 该研究显著加速了数据集生成过程，提升了驱逐检测的可扩展性，并为其他信息提取任务提供了可推广的思路和工具。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有方法未充分考慮行動替代方案，可能導致語言模型代理過於偏向看似合理但次優的行動。

Method: 引入自洽性行動採樣和執行引導的行動批判，幫助模型生成逐步行動審議過程，並用來對模型進行進一步微調。

Result: 在兩個互動式代理任務中，SAND框架使模型的表現相比初始監督微調提升了20%，並且優於現有最佳調教方法。

Conclusion: SAND通過結合行動審議和微調策略，有效提升了大型語言模型代理的行動選擇性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Conclusion: RLEP有效提高了强化学习模型的效率与性能，为未来研究提供了基础，相关资源已开放以供复现和进一步探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

Method: 提出了“Bullshit Index”指标，设计了“BullshitEval”基准测试集，对机器生成废话分为空洞修辞、含糊其辞、模糊词语和未经验证的断言四类，进行实证分析。

Result: 通过“Marketplace”等数据集实验发现，使用人类反馈强化学习的模型会显著加剧生成废话，推理过程中的链式思考（CoT）策略也会放大废话，尤其是空洞修辞和含糊其辞。而在政治相关文本中，模糊词语是主要策略。

Conclusion: 指出大语言模型在真相一致性上的系统性挑战，并提出改善模型真实行为的新见解。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Method: 引入PLAN-TUNING框架，通过从大型语言模型提取规划路径，并结合监督学习和强化学习微调小型模型，以模仿规划过程。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准测试中，微调模型平均提升约7%的性能；在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024的跨领域数据集上的性能提升分别约为10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING通过引入规划路径有效提升了小型语言模型的复杂推理能力，是一种增强任务性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: TeaR方法有效提升了多种推理任务的性能，表明其在改进逻辑和代码推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Motivation: 氧还原反应催化剂在提高燃料电池效率方面起着关键作用，但从海量科学文献中提取相关信息困难重重，因此需要一种有效的信息提取方法。

Method: 研究通过数据标注、整合，以及微调基于变压器的模型，对DyGIE++与多个专用BERT模型进行实验，评估其在信息提取中的表现，同时探讨标注一致性对提取效果的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，微调后的PubMedBERT模型实现了最高的NER F1得分82.19%，而MatSciBERT模型获得了最佳的RE F1得分66.10%。此外，与人工注释对比，证明了微调模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 领域特定的BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取方面优于通用科学模型，表明这些模型在大规模、自动化文献分析中的潜力。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

*Varin Sikka,Vishal Sikka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于transformer的语言模型(LLMs)的能力局限性，特别是它们在某些任务中的推断复杂性和准确性验证不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在复杂计算和自主任务中的能力界限，特别是针对其在现实应用中的潜力及局限性，例如生成事实不符合或无意义的信息。

Method: 从推理计算复杂性的角度出发，分析LLMs在复杂计算和验证任务方面的能力，提供理论分析并列举实例。

Result: 发现LLMs无法完成超出一定计算复杂性的任务，也不能验证超过一定复杂性的任务的准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs存在能力边界，这对其实际应用的任务定义和范围选择具有深远影响。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种框架，通过微调两种大型语言模型，结合实数据和专家知识，生成并优化心理咨询对话数据，构建了68K对话的中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD）以及综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因社会压力增长，人们对心理支持的需求增加，而相关数据集特别是非英语语言的数据集缺乏。作者希望通过构建高质量多样化的心理支持数据集，改善实际心理援助系统的效果。

Method: 利用有限的真实数据与专家知识微调语言模型：1.对话生成器（Dialog Generator）创建基于预定义路径的大规模心理咨询对话；2.对话修改器（Dialog Modifier）改进对话质量；3.开发综合代理对话支持系统（CADSS），从用户特征分析、对话历史摘要到策略规划和情感支持生成提供全方位功能。

Result: 建立了包含68K对话的中文心理支持对话数据集（CPsDD），同时CADSS在策略预测与情感支持对话任务上实现了领先性能，适用于CPsDD与ESConv数据集。

Conclusion: 通过该框架创建的CPsDD数据集和CADSS系统显著提高了心理支持对话的质量与效果，展现了语言技术在解决社会心理问题上的潜力。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究将语音活动预测（VAP）扩展到三人对话，展示了VAP可以有效预测三方对话中的发言交替。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于两人对话，本研究旨在探索VAP在三人多方对话场景中的适用性，以更准确地预测未来的语音活动。

Method: 基于日语三人对话数据，训练了多个模型，并比较了VAP模型在不同话题类型对三人对话的预测性能。

Result: 结果显示，基于三人对话训练的VAP在所有模型中均优于基线模型，而对话类型会影响预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究证明VAP可用于三人对话场景的发言交替预测，并指出将其应用于语言对话系统的潜力。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 探索如何利用LLMs结合精心设计的少样本提示进行多语言主观性检测，特别是在数据噪声较大或质量较低情况下的效果。

Method: 方法采用少样本提示技术，通过设计精良的提示和高级提示工程（如争辩提示和示例选择策略），将LLMs用于主观性检测任务。

Result: 方法在多个语言的数据集上名列前茅，包括阿拉伯语和波兰语的第一名，以及其他语种（意大利语、英语和德语等）的前四名，特别是在处理阿拉伯语数据时表现出强大的稳定性。

Conclusion: LLMs结合精心设计的少样本学习对多语言情感任务具有高度有效性和适应性，尤其在标注数据稀缺或不一致时，是传统微调方法的一种强有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Motivation: 尽管跨语言RAG在生成任务上取得一定进展，但检索方面的挑战仍未被充分研究，特别是在现实企业数据的跨语言环境中表现出的问题。

Method: 通过构建基于真实企业数据集的基准测试，系统分析用户查询和支持文档语言组合对检索表现的影响，同时提出了一种强制均衡双语检索的方法。

Result: 当用户查询与支持文档分属不同语言时，性能显著下降。提出的强制均衡双语检索策略有效缓解了这一问题，显著提升了跨语言和总体性能。

Conclusion: 检索是跨语言RAG的关键瓶颈，通过优化检索策略可以在实际应用中显著提升性能，展示了改进多语言检索的实际潜力。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: 探讨视觉语言模型中采用长链式推理微调和强化学习的效果及其组合策略的局限性。研究发现，两者难以实现协同增效，反而会带来性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在视觉语言模型中，如何通过长链式推理微调和强化学习来提升多模态推理性能，尤其是评估其结合方式的潜力与局限。

Method: 系统比较长链式推理微调和强化学习对多模态推理基准的影响，并分析二者通过不同组合方式（如分阶段或数据混合）协同作用的效果。

Result: 长链式推理微调增强对复杂问题的深度推理能力，但在简单问题上表现下降；强化学习提升了通用性和简洁性，但在最难问题上的改进较有限。二者结合的各种尝试均未实现协同增效，反而带来性能和风格上的权衡。

Conclusion: 当前的后续训练方法在视觉语言模型中存在“协同困境”，需要更无缝、适应性强的策略来发挥其组合潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 文档图像翻译面临训练数据不足以及视觉-文本信息复杂交互的挑战，亟需一种解决方法以提高模型的推广能力和翻译质量。

Method: 提出一个单一到混合模态对齐的框架（M4Doc），利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的表示进行对齐。训练时让轻量化DIMT模型学会关键的视觉-文本相关性，推理时绕过MLLM以保证计算高效。

Result: 实验表明M4Doc在翻译质量上有显著提升，特别是在跨领域通用性和复杂文档图像场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: M4Doc通过创新的模态对齐方法，有效应对DIMT中的关键挑战，展示其提升翻译质量和推广性能的潜力。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的推断时集成方法, 通过K次掩码-降噪操作计算后验感知的token概率和不确定性估计，无需额外训练代价。

Result: 该方法在WikiText-2数据集上取得了测试困惑度8.8（K=8），优于类似规模的GPT-2 Small的20.3。

Conclusion: 利用简单的轻量级集成方法，可以在不增加模型规模基础上显著提升模型性能，同时能给予后验和不确定性信息，具有实际可行性和较高应用价值。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决LLMs因高计算需求难以在资源受限环境中部署的问题。

Method: 利用Pythia和Qwen2.5家族的模型为基础，通过知识蒸馏技术进行压缩，并在问答任务的两个基准数据集(SQuAD和MLQA)上进行评估。

Result: 学生模型保留了教师模型90%以上的性能，同时降低了最多57.1%的参数规模。相比零样本提示，一样本提示能进一步提高性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合简单提示技术，可以实现适用于资源受限场景的紧凑且高效的问答系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Result: 提出的改进方法不仅能匹敌现有技术水平，还能在减半的检索成本下保持高性能。

Conclusion: 无需依赖大规模微调即可优化RAG，且通过结合传统方法与效率优化实现了高性价比的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 解决目前评估文本摘要质量时需要耗时人工参考摘要的问题，并提供一个可靠的自动化质量评价方法。

Method: 开发了一个新的指标NOIR，使用语言模型嵌入来衡量语义相似性，并结合摘要长度和语义保留来评估总结质量的折中。

Result: 实验证明NOIR能够有效捕捉摘要中的词长与语义保留的权衡，并且与人类的质量感知高度相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为不同的文本摘要任务提供了一个可靠的自动化质量评估工具，有助于改进总结算法、提示词或生成的摘要。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Conclusion: SAS和PEAA同时提高了注意力机制的表达能力和参数效率，为实现高性能而维护了较低的模型复杂度，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

Method: 复现Vec2Text框架，在不同设置下验证结果，并延伸研究包括参数敏感性分析和隐私防护方法测试。

Result: 成功复现原始关键结果，发现Vec2Text能够在理想条件下重构敏感输入，并提出量化技术等防护方法。

Conclusion: 需要在使用文本嵌入时保持谨慎，并进一步研究更强大的防护机制以保护NLP系统隐私。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: 提出选择性对齐策略，优先处理高影响力的tokens，提高LLM对齐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练后对齐大语言模型时，并非所有tokens同等重要的问题。

Method: 利用参考模型与当前策略间的token级别对数概率差异，优先选择高信息价值的token以进行对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Selective-DPO方法在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中优于标准DPO及基于蒸馏的基线。

Conclusion: token级别优化及参考模型选择在提升LLM偏好对齐中至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamST要求在连续接收源语音输入的同时生成翻译，现有方法面临上下文限制和策略学习的挑战，StreamUni通过统一的大型语音-语言模型（LSLM）实现一体化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的StreamST方法需要结合分段模型，在有限的上下文信息下进行策略决策和翻译生成，表现受到挑战，同时SimulST模型难以有效学习策略。

Method: 提出StreamUni，通过引入语音推理（Chain-of-Thought, CoT）指导LSLM生成多阶段输出，实现语音分段、策略决策和翻译生成的一体化。引入流式CoT训练方法以增强低延迟策略决策和生成能力，无需大量的策略特定训练。

Result: 实验表明，StreamUni在StreamST任务中取得了最新的性能表现。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一的LSLM架构解决了StreamST的低延迟与高翻译质量之间的平衡问题，实现了性能和效率的提升。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何将逻辑公式的嵌入反转为具体需求，提出了基于Transformer的解码模型来解决信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入反转问题，展示了模型的嵌入和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决逻辑公式嵌入语义反转问题，从而支持连续学习与优化，以及直接在公式的语义空间中操作。

Method: 构建一个基于Transformer的解码器模型，训练其从信号时序逻辑公式的语义嵌入生成具体公式；并通过构造STL语法的小型词库训练，以实现从嵌入到公式的通用性和简单性。

Result: 模型可以在少量训练中生成有效公式，甚至在语义上与参考公式保持等价，同时在长度和嵌套复杂度上更简单。此外，模型在不同行公式复杂性的训练数据中表现有效，并能够应用于需求挖掘任务。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了将逻辑公式嵌入反转为简约且语义等价公式的可行性，并展示了在轨迹分类优化等任务中的成功应用。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Method: 提出了加权指令微调（WIT），通过系统性实验对微调中提示与响应标记的权重进行调整分析，以确定最优的权重分配策略。

Result: 发现对提示标记赋予低至中等权重，对响应标记赋予中等至高权重的模型在性能和鲁棒性方面表现最佳，同时这种方式还为后续偏好对齐训练提供了更好的起点。

Conclusion: 标准指令微调损失函数存在改进空间，调整权重能生成更稳健广泛适用的模型，建议重新审视指令微调的损失设计。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Motivation: 现有的单元语法分词方法在跨语言语义对齐上存在改进空间，因而需要探索新方法提高性能。

Method: 通过将目标语言的分词概率与平行数据中的源语言分词条件结合，提出一种优化跨语言语义对齐的分词技术。

Result: 在语言建模中取得一致的困惑度降低，但在机器翻译质量上无显著提升。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次扩展可能导致数据效率瓶颈，实用的跨语言分词需要替代的参数化方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Method: 研究了实体共指如何影响文档检索和生成性能，从检索相关性、上下文理解和整体响应质量角度进行分析，并比较不同的池化策略，同时在结合共指消解的前提下进行实验分析。

Result: 共指消解可以提升检索效果，并通过实验发现均值池化策略在上下文捕捉能力上表现更优；对于小模型，共指消解的益处更明显。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RAG系统中共指复杂性带来的问题，提出通过共指消解提升检索与生成性能，为知识密集型AI应用提供了改进方法指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Conclusion: 通过类比语义病毒设计了传播模式，并基于范畴论、信息论及AI认知模型，将概念付诸实践，提供实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话健康代理（CHAs）缺乏适应性，无法进行多轮推理、症状澄清以及透明决策，难以满足临床诊断需求。

Method: 提出DocCHA框架，将诊断过程分为三阶段：症状引导、病史获取、因果图构建，并利用可解释的置信度评分实现自适应问询和推理优化。

Result: 在两个真实的中文咨询数据集IMCS21和DX上，DocCHA的诊断准确性比强基线模型提高5.18%，症状回忆率提高超过30%。

Conclusion: DocCHA能够支持结构化、透明、高效的诊断对话，为多语言和资源受限环境中的可信赖临床助手提供可能性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 本自动化框架展示了LLMs在计算结构生物学中的广泛应用潜力，为未来的仿真自动化发展提供了平台支持。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM在面对工业异常检测时存在解释性差和泛化能力差的问题，因其需要精准、结构化及上下文感知的分析。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，通过自引导事实增强（SFE）和基于熵的直接偏好优化（E-DPO）改进推理能力，并构建包含28,415个问题回答实例的工业异常推理数据集（AD-PL）。

Result: SAGE在零样本和单样本设置下表现优异，能够更好地应对工业异常推理任务。

Conclusion: SAGE框架大大提升了VLM在工业任务中的适用性，其代码、模型和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

TL;DR: MIRIX是一个模组化、多代理记忆系统，解决了AI在长时记忆中的瓶颈问题，并在多模态和文本测试中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI记忆系统局限性明显，无法个性化和长期可靠记忆，因此需要更强大的解决方案。

Method: MIRIX通过六种记忆类型与多代理框架结合，能动态更新及检索多样化、长期的用户数据，支持多模态记忆。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA测试中，MIRIX准确率比基线高35%，存储需求减少99.9%；在LOCOMO测试中，进表现优异，达到85.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: MIRIX为具有记忆能力的语言模型树立了全新标杆，并通过应用展示其实用性和隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [140] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章研究了隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）的泛化差距，并发现这种差距的原因是IM-RM更多依赖于表层的标记级别特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）在泛化性能之间的差异及其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验，研究了IM-RM与EX-RM在标记级别特征上的依赖差异，并对其他可能的假设进行了论证。

Result: 发现IM-RM比EX-RM更依赖表层的标记级别特征，从而在标记级别分布偏移和分布内任务中泛化表现较差。同时，对一些传统假设，如生成任务难度对IM-RM的影响作了反驳。

Conclusion: IM-RM与EX-RM虽在训练数据和损失函数等方面相同，但其设计细节对泛化性能有重大影响，隐式奖励模型对标记特征的依赖是泛化性能差距的主因。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 探讨在风湿病学领域中，如何利用语言模型支持临床决策并优化诊断与治疗性能。

Method: 结合小型语言模型与检索增强生成方法（RAG），并评估其性能与大语言模型的对比情况。

Result: 小型模型在诊断和治疗性能上优于大模型，同时显著降低能耗，并适合本地化部署，适用于资源有限的医疗条件。

Conclusion: 尽管小型模型的表现可满足一定需求，但其准确性仍不及专家水平，需辅助专家进行决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在临床决策中的广泛使用，透明可信的推理能力评估成为关键，但目前的评估方法存在不足，缺乏严格的基准工具。

Method: 提出了MedThink-Bench及一个名为LLM-w-Ref的评估框架，通过细化的推理步骤和LLM裁判机制，实现与专家评估一致的高保真推理评估。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-w-Ref与专家评估高度相关，并且小模型在某些情况下能优于大规模专有模型，比如MedGemma-27B优于OpenAI-o3。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为评估LLMs的医学推理能力提供了基础性工具，对其在临床实践中的安全应用具有推进作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: 提出了PyVision，一个使多模态语言模型（MLLMs）能够生成、执行并改进基于Python工具的新框架，用于更灵活的视觉推理任务，实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉推理方法受限于预定义工作流和静态工具的问题，提升MLLMs在动态工具生成和任务适应方面的能力。

Method: 设计了PyVision框架，它使MLLMs具备交互、迭代生成和优化Python工具的能力，同时开发了工具分类法并通过多种基准评估框架性能。

Result: PyVision在多项基准测试中表现出显著提升，比如在V*数据集上将GPT-4.1性能提高了7.8%，在VLMsAreBlind-mini数据集上将Claude-4.0-Sonnet提高了31.1%。

Conclusion: PyVision框架展示了动态工具生成在视觉推理中的优势，标志着从工具使用到工具创造的转变，并推动模型向更高效的视觉推理发展。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了当前最先进的大语言模型在简单推理任务上的表现，发现尽管这些模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但在『简单』问题中仍存在明显失败，尤其是在改变问题描述或简化条件时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的语言模型虽然能解决复杂的逻辑推理任务，但在能够进行更基础、简单的逻辑推理和应用任务中表现并不令人满意的问题需要进一步探索。

Method: 作者创建了一个包含计数、命题逻辑、证明树、旅行规划等的简单推理任务数据集，同时引入一个名为unpuzzles的微型基准测试，分析模型在问题描述变化情况下的表现差异。

Result: 研究表明，即使是最先进的思维模型，在处理这些低复杂度任务时，也存在统计捷径、过程错误以及长上下文处理困难的问题；另外，模型在『简化版』问题上的表现也差于原始复杂形式。

Conclusion: 当代语言模型在跨分布推广和简单推理任务上的局限性仍然突出，即使问题变『简单』也不能提高模型性能，这突出了模型逻辑推理能力的不足。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行化工领域故障恢复计划与连续过程控制的统一架构，通过案例研究验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化工过程复杂性增加，劳动力短缺以及复杂故障情景需要新的自动化方法，将符号推理和自适应控制相结合。

Method: 引入基于LLMs的统一代理框架，使用有限状态机（FSM）作为操作界限，通过规划代理、仿真实验代理和验证-重提示环路实现故障恢复与过程控制。

Result: Case Study 1中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在生成的FSM中达到100%有效路径成功率；Case Study 2中，在实验平台上实现了与传统PID控制相似的性能。

Conclusion: 论文展示了通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs可将高层计划与底层控制结合，为化工领域的语言驱动自动化提供了方向。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Method: 提出一种基于偏见采样的动态方法BOOST，调整温度缩放和采样概率以减少偏见，同时引入新指标SODC评估类间偏见。

Result: 通过在KaoKore和PACS数据集测试，BOOST方法显著减少了类间偏见，同时在性能和公平性之间获得良好的平衡。

Conclusion: BOOST是一种针对偏见数据集的有效方法，能显著提升艺术分类AI模型的公平性和鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable

placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%

Result: 对比了人工与自动化特征提取的效果，并识别供应链中与强迫劳动相关的非法活动特征。

Conclusion: 基于问题树的LLM方法可更系统地评估非法活动相关性，为供应链非法活动检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Conclusion: 在多模态翻译任务中，结合视觉、背景上下文及领域知识显著提升了翻译系统的性能。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

Method: 研究在过滤输入提示和输出生成时的计算可行性，并在密码学硬度假设下分析其局限性，同时提出并测试放宽过滤要求的缓解方法。

Result: 表明存在一些LLMs，其输入提示的有害与否对任何高效的过滤器而言无法区分，且在某些自然情况下，输出过滤的计算是不可行的。

Conclusion: 仅依赖于外部过滤器无法确保LLM安全性，过滤需要与模型本身的架构与权重实现深度绑定，并提出AI系统的智能与判断力不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

*Zerui Yang,Yuwei Wan,Yinqiao Li,Yudai Matsuda,Tong Xie,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DrugMCTS框架，通过结合检索增强生成、代理协作和蒙特卡罗树搜索，显著提升药物重新定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型在科学领域应用受困于其预训练知识的局限性以及常规方法的高计算成本或结构化数据利用不足。

Method: 设计DrugMCTS框架，多代理协作，结合蒙特卡罗树搜索和检索机制，无需领域特定微调即可实现迭代结构化推理。

Result: DrugMCTS不但超越了一般模型，还使 Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct 在相关任务中比 Deepseek-R1 高出20%。

Conclusion: 结果表明结构化推理、多代理协作及反馈搜索机制对大模型在药物发现领域的应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究引入了一个新的基准StarDojo，基于游戏《星露谷》评估AI在开放端的生产-生活模拟中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准很少同时评估自动化代理的生产活动和社会互动能力，因此需要一个综合的评测框架。

Method: 提出StarDojo基准，设计了1000个任务（包括农业、制作、探索、战斗和社交），并提供简化的100个代表性任务进行模型评估。此外，StarDojo具有友好的界面，多模态支持和多实例并行能力。

Result: 现有最先进的基础模型（例如GPT-4.1）的成功率仅为12.7%，显示出现有AI在视觉理解、多模态推理和低级操控方面的显著不足。

Conclusion: StarDojo提供了一个综合环境，为进一步研究在复杂生产生活环境中的鲁棒开放式代理提供了可能性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Motivation: 目前针对大语言模型解决问题的算法理解较少。研究主要集中在通过扩展模型提升表现，忽视了算法的理论和经验理解。

Method: 提出了AlgEval框架，包括形成顶层关于候选算法的假设，以及通过注意力模式和隐藏状态的电路级分析对这些假设进行验证。

Result: 案例研究着重于理解大模型中的搜索算法，展示了从假设生成到验证的系统方法。

Conclusion: 系统理解LLMs的算法性能不仅提供了资源节约型的模型训练方法，还能推动解释性与新型架构的发展。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域中，机器学习预测结果的解释性极为重要，错误的解释可能误导人类决策者。因此需要研究基于规则的机器学习模型的潜在问题。

Method: 本文发展了一些算法，用于分析基于规则的机器学习模型中的负面特性，例如负重叠和某种形式的冗余问题。

Result: 研究发现，当前广泛使用的基于规则的机器学习模型工具会产生具有一种或多种负面特性的规则集。

Conclusion: 高风险应用中的基于规则的模型需要关注其潜在的负面特性，以提升预测结果的解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Motivation: 解决传统GNN模型在知识图谱链路预测中性能提升有限的问题，并探索新方法来处理归纳学习场景中的测试实体。

Method: 提出了Context Pooling方法，通过引入图池化技术和构建基于查询的特定图谱来提升模型性能，并使用邻域精确度和召回率指标来选择逻辑相关的邻居节点。

Result: 在三组公开的迁移和归纳数据集上的42/48场景中，Context Pooling方法表现出领先的性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling开启了知识图谱图池化的应用，显著增强了链路预测任务，在归纳式学习上也具有出色的表现。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: 新方法在保持计算效率的同时，增强了不确定性表征的稳健性，为credal网络的应用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief

uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

TL;DR: PlanQA是一种诊断性基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的几何和空间推理能力，展示当前模型在真实布局推理中的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个基准工具，用于测试LLMs在室内几何场景中的推理能力，并推广其对实际空间的认知水平。

Method: 设计PlanQA，通过结构化室内场景表达（如JSON、XML格式），结合多样的问题类型，评估模型的度量、拓扑推理以及室内设计约束（例如通行、清晰度、平衡性等）。

Result: 现有的LLMs在浅层查询中表现尚可，但在模拟物理约束、保持空间一致性或应对布局变化方面存在重大不足。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了当前LLMs在真实世界空间布局推理中的盲点，并催生了针对几何和空间属性推论的新研究需求。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Motivation: 传统DPO尽管在模型对齐上表现出色，但存在理论上的敏感性和偏差问题，这可能削弱模型稳定性和一致性，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示DPO问题后，提出了一种基于双层优化的新框架，结合监督微调和增强的DPO目标，引入正则化以促进优化稳定性和偏好输出提升。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理准确性和偏好分布对齐上优于现有DPO方法。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为设计偏好对齐目标提供了新的视角，并有助于建立更可靠和可解释的模型对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI的基准主要关注技术能力或减少危害，而缺乏对AI如何促进人类整体幸福的评估，因此需要一个全面评价框架。

Method: 设计并采用FAI Benchmark框架，通过1,229个客观和主观问题，评估AI在七个幸福维度的表现，并使用几何平均评分法确保平衡性。

Result: 测试的28种主要语言模型中，最高得分为72/100，但没有模型在所有维度上表现接受，尤其在信仰、品格和意义上表现不足。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark提供了鼓励AI支持人类幸福的新框架，这对AI的开发、伦理和评价具有重大意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Conclusion: MoSE在实现低计算开销的同时，显著提升了自主驾驶模型在复杂场景推理中的性能，提供了一种新的高效驾驶学习与推理方法。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Motivation: 当前AI依赖于扩大模型规模和训练数据量，但此方法存在环境、经济及伦理问题，缺乏可持续性。而生物感知系统的动态适配为新范式提供了启示。

Method: 提出适应性感知方法，通过动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置）减少偏移，提升效率及模型表现。

Conclusion: 适应性感知是AI发展的关键转变，可实现更可持续、公平及高效的人工智能。作者提出了具体应用计划及研究方向。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

TL;DR: 近年来，因果推理在提升机器学习模型的性能、可靠性和可解释性方面发挥了重要作用。然而，当前的XAI（可解释人工智能）领域面临批评，主要因缺乏对实际因果关系的深入研究。本研究提出了一组复杂度为多项式的算法，以鉴别实际因果关系，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>

Motivation: XAI传统文献虽然对因果因素的理解有助于研究与工程，但非专业用户更期待实际因果关系的解释。然而，这种实际因果的形式化仍是一个未解决的问题，且现有方法多为NP完全问题，缺乏实际高效的解决方案。

Method: 研究提出多项式复杂度的算法，能够通过调整精度和详尽度识别实际因果关系，并且这套算法适用于非布尔、黑箱和随机系统等领域，填补现有方法的空白。

Conclusion: 所提算法有效解决了实际因果关系识别问题，并兼具灵活性和广泛适用性，为进一步的应用与研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

*Mingda Zhang,Na Zhao,Jianglong Qing,Qing xu,Kaiwen Pan,Ting luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过引入提示工程和多维知识图谱的整合框架，提出了解决大型语言模型在法律纠纷分析中知识表现不足、概念理解与推理缺陷问题的方案。实验结果证明了其在法律纠纷分析领域的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型语言模型在法律智能系统中扮演重要角色，但其在法律纠纷分析中存在知识表示不足、概念理解不充分及推理能力欠缺的限制。

Method: 提出一种整合提示工程与多维知识图谱的增强框架，引入三阶段分层提示结构、构建三层法律知识图谱架构，同时结合四种补充方法（如领域特定语义向量相似度和基于本体路径的推理等）并配合网络搜索技术，最终建成一个知识增强型法律决策框架。

Result: 通过实验验证，该框架显著提升了复杂案例的法律应用分析能力，同时展现了对于司法决策逻辑的精确理解。

Conclusion: 研究为实现智能化法律辅助系统提供了一种技术新方案，推动了法律纠纷分析领域的进步。

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI系统在计算扩展方面的不平等现象，提出尽管计算扩展有边际收益递减的现象，但较小计算资源的模型（"meek models"）性能会逐步接近最优秀的模型，并从数据和理论模型中验证这种趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去十年的AI系统发展主要由少数公司主导，导致性能上的不平等问题。本研究试图理解计算资源的边际效益递减如何可能缩小这一性能差距。

Method: 文章通过理论计算模型和数据分析，研究了固定分布目标任务下计算资源边际效益递减现象，并从训练损失与能力表现相关性入手，验证模型能力的趋近性。

Result: 即便某些组织可以指数级扩展模型计算能力，其相较于资源有限组织的能力优势也会逐渐减少。

Conclusion: 随着较小计算资源模型能力的提升，AI的策略和政策需要重新审视，包括其对行业和政策领域的潜在影响。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

TL;DR: 本文通过研究微软Bing Copilot生成式AI系统的交互数据，分析了AI对不同职业和工作活动的适用性及成功率，并计算产生AI适用性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于生成式AI被迅速采用并可能对各类任务产生广泛影响，理解AI对经济的作用成为紧迫的社会问题。本研究旨在通过分析AI在工作活动中的应用情况及其成功率，为解决这一问题迈出了一步。

Method: 分析了20万条来自微软Bing Copilot用户的匿名和隐私处理后的对话数据，分类用户寻求帮助的活动类型及AI提供支持的活动类型，并将其与职业相关数据结合，计算职业AI适用性分数。

Result: 发现用户最常请求AI协助的信息收集和写作活动，AI最常进行的信息提供、写作、教学及建议活动。知识型职业，如计算机与数学、行政支持及销售类职业有最高的AI适用性分数。

Conclusion: AI对知识型职业和信息处理相关工作表现出较高适用性，但具体适用性涉及任务成功率、工资及教育背景等因素的关联分析。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的扩展方法过于资源密集，缺乏灵活性，作者希望探索一种更高效、灵活的模型开发方法。

Method: 利用固定的表示层作为基础，实现模块组合与逐层深度增长。具体包括：1. 将通过不同数据集训练的专家模型无修改融合为一个更强的专家模型；2. 提出逐层构造的训练方式，逐层增加深度并训练。

Result: 1. 多专家模型在推理表现上优于单一模型；2. 基于逐层增长的方式，随着深度增加，模型推理能力有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出了一种从端到端优化向生物学启发的构造型方法转变的可能性，具有高效扩展、持续学习及模块化优势，为构建AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 本文研究针对复合图像检索（CIR）的时尚领域挑战，提出FACap数据集与FashionBLIP-2模型，提高了时尚CIR任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CIR方法在一般领域表现良好，但对复杂领域（如时尚）因词汇多样性及缺乏大规模数据，表现仍有限。本研究旨在针对这些具体问题提出解决方案。

Method: 构建了自动化的大规模时尚CIR数据集FACap，通过两阶段的注释流程结合视觉语言模型（VLM）和语言模型（LLM），生成高质量的修改文本，并设计基于BLIP-2的专属模型FashionBLIP-2，通过适配器和多头匹配机制精调模型。

Result: 实验在Fashion IQ与enhFashionIQ基准上表明，FACap与FashionBLIP-2的结合在颜值CIR领域显著提升了模型性能，特别是对细粒度修改文本的检索能力。

Conclusion: FACap数据集与FashionBLIP-2模型展示了在需求严格的电商环境中处理时尚CIR任务的潜力，其方法论和实验证明了合理性。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在处理与组合任务相关的问题时是否能通过其连续性与分布特点实现有效的泛化。

Method: 通过扩大数据规模与模型规模并分析网络在任务编码和训练数据分布上是否能系统性地泛化组合结构。

Result: 发现只需线性数量的神经元即可实现对一般组合任务族的高精度近似，同时能线性解码任务的组成部分。

Conclusion: 扩大训练数据与模型规模是实现组合泛化的关键，且任务组成的隐藏激活信息是模型能否成功泛化的指标。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为autoeval-dmun的自动化工具，评估扩散模型中的“机器遗忘”方法的效果及其对相关概念的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少重复训练带来的高昂成本，同时确保扩散模型去除不必要信息后依然适用。

Method: 通过使用语言模型提取与目标概念相关的结构化知识，并利用对抗性提示评估扩散模型的遗忘效果及其对周边概念的损害。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型能构建与遗忘损害相关的语义排列，并通过合成对抗性提示有效规避遗忘过程中的不足。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun提供了更精确的评估工具，揭示了现有遗忘方法潜在的局限性及可改进的方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型(LLMs)和视觉语言模型(VLMs)的规模和应用日益增长，注意力机制因其高内存和时间复杂度成为主要的计算瓶颈。作者希望评估不同注意力机制在训练中的实际能源使用及硬件需求，以指导节能设计。

Method: 作者基于GPT-2架构对8种注意力机制进行了基准测试，测量了训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用率和功耗等关键指标，重点评估其能效表现。

Result: 启用优化内核实现的注意力机制，如Flash Attention、局部敏感哈希(LSH) Attention和多头潜在注意力(MLA)，表现出最高的能效。研究还发现，降低GPU功耗并不足以直接减少能源使用，因为训练时间同样重要。

Conclusion: 本文强调关注节能的基准测试在注意力机制设计中的重要性，并为选择高效的注意力机制提供了实际见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN无法有效捕获链接预测中节点对间的子图结构，影响预测准确性。

Method: 使用GNN计算节点表示后提取候选节点对的最短路径，并通过序列模型处理路径中的节点嵌入序列。

Result: SP4LP在多种链接预测基准测试中实现了前沿的性能表现。

Conclusion: SP4LP比传统的消息传递GNN及其他方法更具表达能力，为图中链接预测提供了通用且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图对比学习方法主要关注捕捉隐式语义关系，但忽略了图结构和属性中隐藏的结构性常识知识，这些知识对有效表示学习至关重要。

Method: 通过引入称为Str-GCL的新框架，利用一阶逻辑规则表征结构性常识，并通过表征对齐机制明确融入这些常识，同时不改变原始图结构。

Result: 实验表明Str-GCL比现有的图对比学习方法表现优异。

Conclusion: Str-GCL首次将结构性常识直接融入图对比学习，为图表示学习提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

*Sua Lee,Kyubum Shin,Jung Ho Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DeMul的新方法，通过消除描述提取的步骤直接将大型语言模型(LLM)的知识注入提示中，提升视觉语言模型(VLM)在下游任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究表明，通过提示学习，可以在不需求额外标注数据集的前提下有效适配视觉语言模型(VLM)至下游任务。然而，现有的方法在利用大型语言模型(LLM)时，通常会提取文本描述信息，但这会带来较高的变异性和较低的可靠性。

Method: 该方法采用无描述化多提示学习的方法，将LLM的知识直接注入提示中，通过优化连续向量的形式取代离散预定义模板，并在多提示设置下，通过提示加权机制来反映不同提示在训练中的重要性。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法实现了更优的性能表现。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过去除描述提取的步骤，不仅丰富了提示语义，还通过多提示和权重机制进一步提升了模型表现，展现出在视觉语言领域的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为条件引导流匹配（CGFM）的新方法，解决了现有扩散模型在时间序列预测中的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在时间序列预测中表现受限，如刚性分布来源和有限的采样路径。此外，现有方法无法利用预测错误带来的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出的CGFM方法扩展了流匹配，结合辅助模型的输出，通过将历史数据作为条件，并构建两侧的条件概率路径和一般仿射路径来提升预测效果。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，CGFM连续优化并优于当前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过结合误差信息和更灵活的方法，成功推动了时间序列预测方法的进步。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管预训练模型已在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中带来了显著进展，但在强化学习问题中，如何有效结合不同预训练模型的潜在信息仍需探索。

Method: 提出了一种称为WSA的架构，通过共享注意力权重的方式结合多个预训练模型的嵌入，以实现效率与性能的平衡。

Conclusion: WSA为融合预训练模型信息提供了一种高效且性能良好的方法，为强化学习领域的状态表示增强提出了新的可能。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Conclusion: DeCoLe为解决标签偏差异常检测提供有效工具，并可用于组织数据管理实践以提高数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Conclusion: 新方法在稳定性和可扩展性方面改进明显，并适配现代深度学习框架。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: MUSE展示了使用多语言模型子集集成的潜力，能够在促进校准和预测性能时更好地量化不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Conclusion: 首次证明了鲁棒的多模态学习框架在融合IMU和雷达数据用于食物摄入手势检测方面的有效性。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Conclusion: 此框架增强了因果推断能力，使得高风险领域的因果分析和实际应用更具可操作性和可靠性。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Method: 开发了TRIP（通过置换进行可靠解释的测试），并展示了如何扩展到高维场景，以检测模型外推导致的不可靠特征重要性分数。

Result: 通过模拟数据和具体应用测试，TRIP成功检测了不可靠的置换特征重要性分数。

Conclusion: TRIP是一种可行且有效的方法，用于提升模型解释性中特征重要性分数的可靠性，尤其在高维相关特征场景中具有实际意义。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Motivation: 由于基站资源有限以及任务处理异构性，需优化资源块分配和用户调度以提升CFL性能，同时需解决设备任务身份识别时的通信开销。

Method: 提出了一种动态惩罚函数辅助的值分解多智能体强化学习（DPVD-MARL）算法，使分布式基站独立优化用户连接、资源分配及差分隐私噪声，共同最小化所有学习任务的训练损失。

Result: DPVD-MARL相比独立Q学习，在收敛速度上提高了20%，累计奖励提升了15%。

Conclusion: 结合差分隐私和优化的MARL算法使得分布式CFL更高效、安全，提高了训练任务的整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）的框架，用于生成隐蔽的对抗性攻击以规避无人机入侵检测系统（IDS），并采用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）改进检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法往往无法识别新型威胁，尤其是对抗性攻击下表现不足，因此需要更智能的IDS来增强无人机系统的安全性。

Method: 设计了一个经过训练的多类IDS分类器，用以检测已知攻击，并基于cGAN生成对抗性样本，同时使用CVAE通过负对数似然方法区分对抗性输入与真实OOD样本。

Result: CVAE的表现显著优于传统的基于马氏距离的方法，在检测隐蔽的对抗性威胁方面取得了更高的效果。

Conclusion: 利用先进的概率建模技术能够显著增强IDS应对基于生成模型的适应性网络攻击能力。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在生成信息时出现科学上合理但事实错误的问题，尤其是化学领域的“似是而非”问题。

Method: 通过使用Magistral Small模型并利用Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)进行微调，同时创建了一个包含分子属性和化学反应等的“双领域数据集”来训练模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在遵循格式、化学分子生成的正确性和合成路线的可行性方面显著优于基线模型。同时，模型展现了语法正确性先于化学可能性和合成可行性学习的层次模式。

Conclusion: 研究提出了将通用大语言模型改造为可靠化学研究工具的框架，同时指出了目前的局限性及未来改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Method: 通过在图变换器前加一个黎曼混合专家层，基于局部结构将节点投射到更匹配的球形、平面或双曲几何流形中；同时结合欧几里得和非欧几里得特征进行预测。

Result: 在四个节点分类基准测试中，准确率提高了最多3%。

Conclusion: 显式的几何感知投影不仅提升了预测精度，还使图表示更具解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Result: 通过理论和仿真实验证明，CEBE是真值Q函数的一级近似，CSE方法在仿真环境中的使用有效提升了DRL的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CEBE和CSE为减少多上下文数据需求的同时提升DRL在单一上下文训练下的泛化性能提供了有效解法，在一定条件下可以显著改善泛化表现。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Result: 得到了在更宽泛条件下PU学习所需样本量的上界和下界。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了PU学习的适用范围，并为更现实条件下的算法设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Motivation: 改善当前因果实验设计方法中对干预的效率和针对性，尤其是对用户指定的因果问题的研究。

Method: 开发了GO-CBED框架，通过变分下界估计器计算期望信息增益（EIG），使用基于transformer的策略网络和基于normalizing flow的变分后验联合优化，从而在实验设计中实现面向目标的非短视优化。

Result: GO-CBED在多种因果推理和发现任务中均优于现有基线，特别是在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的条件下。

Conclusion: GO-CBED证明了将实验设计目标与具体研究目标对齐以及前瞻性顺序规划的益处。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Conclusion: TLC框架改进了CV学习方法，能更准确捕捉系统动力学行为，提升了复杂分子系统中稀有事件的模拟性能。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet基准测试中，GTED取得了最高的准确率和Kappa评分，优于所有基线指标。

Conclusion: GTED框架为社区提供了一个更忠实的评估语义相似性的指标，有助于推动自动形式化陈述领域的发展。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

*Pengfei Jiao,Jialong Ni,Di Jin,Xuan Guo,Huan Liu,Hongjiang Chen,Yanxian Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HGMP的多任务提示学习框架，通过统一任务格式和对比式预训练策略提升异质图神经网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练和微调方法存在与下游任务不匹配的问题，难以充分发挥在异质图任务中的潜力。

Method: 该方法将下游任务重新表示为图级任务，设计一种图级对比预训练策略，并引入异质特征提示以改进输入图特征的表示。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多个公用数据集上适应性强，性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HGMP框架通过改进任务一致性和异质信息利用，解决了预训练模型和下游任务之间的匹配问题，并提升了异质图任务的整体性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: 深度神经网络在常规的下一个token预测任务中，能够本质上发现并表示数据生成模型的低维信念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络处理不同输入序列时如何体现生成模型的信念表示，并揭示其几何关系的普遍性。

Method: 通过研究神经元激活的几何关系和概率密度，分析不同架构神经网络在输入序列上的信念更新表现。

Result: 发现深度神经网络可以自然地表现出某种低维生成模型信念的量子性质，与经典电路的表现能力相比更为优势且独特。

Conclusion: 神经网络的信念表达是受历史输入驱动的，且与特定架构无关，进一步反映了输入历史如何影响未来结果的机制。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Result: 通用模型展现了解决未直接训练任务及灵活处理不同形式数据的能力，尽管许多应用目前仍为原型。

Conclusion: 随着对通用模型兴趣的增加，预计未来几年其在化学科学中的应用将更加成熟。

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

TL;DR: 提出了DTME-MTL框架，通过在token空间进行动态调整，提升了多任务学习的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架在任务目标差异时容易导致负迁移，而变压器的固定网络结构限制了其适应性。

Method: 提出Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL)框架，通过在token空间检测梯度冲突并实施自适应调整，避免参数过度增长的情况下实现负迁移的抑制。

Result: 实验表明，DTME-MTL在提升多任务性能的同时保持了较低的计算开销。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL提供了一个高效可扩展的解决方案，用于改进基于变压器的多任务学习模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统BCI分类器与深度学习方法的分类和不确定性量化能力，发现传统方法在不确定性量化上表现更优，而深度学习方法在分类准确性上更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高脑机接口的分类准确性和不确定性量化能力，以优化其对模糊样本的处理能力。

Method: 研究对比了传统BCI分类器（如CSP-LDA和MDRM）及深度学习方法（Deep Ensembles、直接不确定性量化和标准CNNs）的性能表现，并通过引入温度标定方法提高MDRM的性能。

Result: CSP-LDA和经过温度标定的MDRM-T提供了最佳的不确定性估计，而深度学习方法（Deep Ensembles和CNN）则表现出更好的分类效果。

Conclusion: 所有模型均成功区分了简单和困难的样本，表明可以通过拒绝模糊样本来提升脑机接口的总体分类精度。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Neural Concept Verifier (NCV)的新框架，将Prover-Verifier Games与概念编码结合，实现高维数据的可解释非线性分类，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PVG为非线性分类模型提供可验证性的潜力，但尚未应用于高维图像等复杂输入；而CBM虽可将此类数据解码为可解释概念，但受限于线性预测器。

Method: 提出结合PVGs与概念编码的NCV框架，首先通过最小监督概念发现模型提取结构化编码，之后借助Prover选择编码，Verifier作为非线性预测器进行决策。

Result: 在高维、复杂数据集上，NCV性能优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器，并减轻了捷径行为影响。

Conclusion: NCV在实现可解释性与性能之间权衡的同时，展现出通向可执行、可验证的AI的潜力。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DAD的实时去相关异常检测方法，适用于高维、多变量时间序列分析，并展现了卓越的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在检测系统故障、欺诈行为及稀有医学状况等领域至关重要，实时处理高维传感仪数据面临严峻挑战。研究旨在开发不依赖历史数据存储的单次处理方法，以应对实时异常检测需求。

Method: 提出了一种基于在线去相关学习的DAD方法，通过逐步学习和动态监控数据相关结构实现实时检测；并设计了一个特殊的超参数调节策略以适应实际情况。

Result: 通过在基准数据集上的实验，DAD在各类异常检测表现上均优于现有先进方法，并显示出对高维度数据流的显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果与计算效率的平衡上表现杰出，为内存受限环境中的实时异常检测树立了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Motivation: 现代大规模神经网络需要更高效的压缩和微调方法，低秩近似能显著提升性能，但现有方法存在数值不稳定性。

Conclusion: 新的框架提升了计算稳定性和实用性，为低秩近似在神经网络上的应用提供了更加稳健的方法。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动网络多样化和小区规模缩小，传统切换方式面临显著挑战，如延迟增加和失败率上升，因此需要引入新方法来提高切换效率。

Method: 提出了一个基于O-RAN范式并结合元学习的框架，用于优化条件切换（CHO），以达到动态性能优化。

Result: 该方法在信号波动环境下性能比3GPP基准测试高至少180%，并提供了稳健的动态后悔保证。

Conclusion: 通过元学习优化的CHO框架，显著提升了切换性能，为日益复杂的移动网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: 新方法不仅实现了职业自动区分，也为职业转型提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

fundamental conflict with green AI principles as billions of

Motivation: 现有无监督图域适配方法在因果-伪因果特征的交织及全局对齐策略的缺失下表现不佳。

Method: SLOGAN 通过稀疏因果结构建模压缩伪因果关系，并设计生成式干预机制消除局部伪因果耦合，同时利用类别自适应动态校正策略优化目标域伪标签学习。

Result: 在多个实际数据集上的实验结果显示，SLOGAN 方法性能显著优于已有基线方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN 使用了创新性的因果建模与干预策略，能够更有效地应对分布偏移，促进稳定的图表示转移。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Conclusion: TransformEEG在一致性和帕金森病检测的可靠性方面取得显著提升，相较其他模型具有更低的结果偏差和更高的稳定性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合联邦分裂学习（FSL）和Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构，既保障隐私又提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决传统联邦学习（FL）和分裂学习（SL）的隐私性和可扩展性问题，以便于在企业环境下安全地展开协同机器学习。

Method: 采用混合架构，将联邦分裂学习（FSL）与权限区块链Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）结合，通过链码管理FSL的模型执行和对等聚合，同时利用HLF的瞬态字段和私有数据集合（PDCs）保障隐私。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL实现了与集中式FSL相当的精度，同时缩短了每代训练时间；性能测试显示区块链开销最小且准确性得以保持。

Conclusion: 这种去中心化架构在性能与隐私保障上表现出企业级应用的可行性。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索随机ReLU层如何交替折叠与部分恢复输入变化的子空间，细化对深层网络表达能力的理解。

Method: 推导随机高斯权重下隐藏激活矩阵期望秩的闭合表达式，并提供次高斯集中界限及深度复苏公式。

Result: 发现隐藏激活矩阵的秩以$1-2/\pi$的比率几何衰减，并在特定深度呈现局部最大值，属于有限宽度现象。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层的子空间表现遵循可预测的周期性模式，为深层网络的数学特性提供了新的理解。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于联邦梯度学习的类平衡数据重放方法（FedCBDR），通过全局协调机制和任务动态调整，在异质数据分布和任务不平衡下提高了模型性能，将Top-1准确率提高了2%-15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦梯度学习（FCIL）在处理类不平衡问题时的性能局限，包括重放缓冲中类间不平衡和新旧任务间的类不平衡。

Method: 提出FedCBDR，包括两个核心组件：全局视角数据重放模块用于隐私保护下的类敏感抽样；任务感知温度缩放模块通过动态调整温度解决类间不平衡问题。

Result: 实验表明，FedCBDR在异构数据分布及任务间不平衡情况下实现了类平衡抽样，并在六种最新方法上提升了2%-15%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过全局协调机制和动态调整策略，显著改善了联邦学习中的类不平衡问题，增强了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）存在的漏洞，通过Jailbreak攻击可导致因生成有害或不道德内容。为评估这些漏洞，提出了一个新的评估协议GuardVal，并在多种模型和领域上进行了测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的漏洞测试方法存在不足且难以应对模型不断变化带来的挑战，因此需要更有效的评估协议。

Method: 提出GuardVal评估协议，通过动态生成和优化Jailbreak提示以测试LLMs的防御能力，包含防止停滞的优化方法，让提示生成更高效。

Result: 对Mistral-7b到GPT-4等多种模型在10个安全领域进行了测试，发现在模型的鲁棒性方面表现出不同模式。

Conclusion: 通过深入理解LLMs行为的表现，可以帮助未来研究并开发更安全的模型。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种利用多任务神经网络估计分布式处理效应的新方法，解决了传统方法在分布尾部精度低和计算效率低的问题，并在多种数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法估计分布式处理效应时存在数据不平衡导致尾部分布精度低以及大规模数据集上需要多次回归导致计算效率低的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于多任务神经网络的新方法，结合单调形状约束和多阈值标签学习来估计条件结果分布，提升准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代因果推断应用中需要深入了解处理效应异质性的情况提供了一种强大且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的机器学习去记忆方法OPC，可实现深层次去记忆，并有效抵御恢复攻击和梯度反演攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器去记忆方法往往仅在表面上遗忘，内部表示仍可恢复已遗忘信息，缺乏深层次遗忘能力。

Method: 提出一种理论上的深层遗忘标准，基于特征一对收缩构造，并设计了一种有效的近似算法，进而构建了一种通用的去记忆算法 OPC。

Result: 在图像分类去记忆基准上，OPC不仅实现了高效的去记忆性能，还展现出对性能恢复攻击和梯度反演攻击的强大抗性。

Conclusion: OPC通过深层特征遗忘显著提升了机器去记忆的理论和实践效果，表明了深层次遗忘对提高去记忆鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TRIX的特征感知对抗训练框架，用以解决对抗训练中的类别间鲁棒性差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的对抗训练方法未能考虑类别间的鲁棒性差异，导致对抗性不公平性问题。

Method: TRIX框架为强类别分配较弱的目标对抗样本以增加特征多样性，而为弱类别分配较强的非目标对抗样本以提高鲁棒性。框架还结合了逐类损失加权及扰动强度调整。

Result: TRIX显著提升了最差类别在干净数据和对抗数据上的准确率，并减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，同时保留了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是一个实用的、朝公平有效对抗防御方向迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Conclusion: 表明需要将环境动态相关的上下文信息纳入策略学习过程。

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Result: S4T在各种多任务基准测试中优于现有的测试时间训练方法，表现更佳。

Conclusion: 通过S4T方法，可以在测试时间内更好地处理领域偏移，实现多任务的统一优化。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Result: 在局部模型网络架构中展示了良好的效果，并通过系统识别基准测试验证了方法的实际有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法提升了状态空间内数据分布的一致性，增强了非线性系统的训练效果、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Motivation: 传统的生存预测方法通常依赖于单一数据模态，限制了捕捉肿瘤生物学复杂性的能力，因此需开发方法融合多模态数据以提升预测效果。

Conclusion: 本文首次将参数化多模态深度学习架构引入竞争风险建模，以支持连续时间事件预测，为可解释且数据驱动的肿瘤生存分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在某些协变量丢失但可用预训练AI模型补全的情境下，如何改善决策过程中的遗憾度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在分析预训练模型在决策问题中对遗憾度的影响，并提出一种新度量标准以统一评估补全模型带来的损失。

Method: 提出了“模型弹性”概念，分析了真实协变量与补全协变量之间差异对奖励函数的敏感性，并基于正交统计学习与双稳健回归对模型进行校准。

Result: 证明了在缺失随机（MAR）条件下，可通过序列校准显著改善补全协变量质量，从而降低遗憾度。

Conclusion: “模型弹性”是理解与改进预训练模型在数据驱动决策任务中应用的重要度量标准，提高了实际决策任务的价值。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Motivation: 弥补自然梯度变分推断收敛性理论难以确立的问题，尤其在对数似然为凹函数以及高斯近似的情况下。

Method: 使用平方根参数化高斯协方差，通过自然梯度与其连续时间梯度流建立新的收敛保障。

Result: 提出的方法显示了自然梯度方法的有效性，优于使用欧几里得或Wasserstein几何的方法。

Conclusion: 平方根参数化方法不仅能有效解决收敛性难题，还突出了自然梯度方法的实用性和理论优势。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小企业对现代经济至关重要，但由于信用记录稀缺，其信用风险分析面临困难，尤其是在线贷款机构。

Method: 使用交易和社交数据中的交互来构建基于图神经网络的模型，分析空间依赖性并预测贷款违约风险。

Result: 在23.4M节点的供应链分析和8.6M节点的违约预测数据集上，图神经网络的表现优于传统方法和其他基线模型，分别实现了0.995和0.701的AUC值。

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

TL;DR: 本文探索了ML中学习偏好的两大理论（损失函数和随机选择）之间的特殊联系，展示了直接偏好优化（DPO）的理论基础及其潜在扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DPO的理论基础及其扩展有助于应对其广泛应用场景及研究热门领域，并规避偏离理论框架的风险。

Method: 通过将Savage损失函数与随机选择理论连接，分析DPO的运作原理，并扩展其支持包括边界条件和长度修正。

Result: 提供了一个全面的框架，解释了DPO的操作原理及其可能的扩展，同时揭示了探索偏离DPO理论的潜在问题和解决方法。

Conclusion: DPO在机器学习偏好学习中的操作从理论上得以清晰化，能够指导与促进该领域的研究及实际应用的规范与提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

TL;DR: ApexOracle是一个AI模型，能够预测现有化合物的抗菌活性，并设计对未曾接触过的菌株有效的新分子，比目前的方法更高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗菌素耐药性问题日益严重，现有抗生素开发速度不足，需要新的方法快速识别有效分子以应对新兴病原体和耐药性菌株。

Method: ApexOracle利用分子特征、基于基础离散扩散语言模型的病原体特定上下文以及结合基因组和文献衍生菌株表示的双嵌入框架进行抗菌活性预测和新分子设计。

Result: ApexOracle在多种细菌种类和化学形式中均优于其他技术，并能高效转移到抗菌数据有限或缺失的新病原体。

Conclusion: 通过结合快速活性预测与定向分子生成，ApexOracle为应对抗菌素耐药性和未来传染病暴发提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using co-folding models for synthetic data

critically on the structural quality of augmented data. In light of this, we
established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的任务多工学习（MTL）优化方法，称为SAMO，通过集成SAM来缓解任务冲突并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务多工学习（MTL）能够捕捉多任务间的共性，但任务冲突问题限制了模型性能。提升MTL模型的性能和优化能力成为迫切需求。

Method: 提出了一种名为SAMO的优化方法，将全局和局部扰动结合应用于多任务学习中，并通过前向传播近似局部扰动，有效减少计算和内存开销。

Result: 实验表明，SAMO在多任务基准测试中表现出色，具有较高的效率和效果。

Conclusion: 新方法SAMO通过减小损失地形的锐度和优化任务冲突问题，为任务多工学习提供了更高效和更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为UnIT的新方法，这是一种无结构的推理时间剪枝技术，用于动态标识并跳过推理中不必要的乘加（MAC）操作，以提高微控制器上的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法依赖结构化稀疏性，并主要在训练或编译阶段应用，未充分利用无结构稀疏性在无SIMD支持或并行计算设备上的潜力。

Method: UnIT利用输入特定的激活模式，动态执行无结构剪枝，将剪枝决策转化为轻量级比较操作，代替乘法，同时设计并行适配嵌入式平台的阈值计算优化方案。

Result: 实验表明，UnIT在MSP430微控制器上的MAC操作减少11.02%-82.03%、推理速度提升27.30%-84.19%、能耗降低27.33%-84.38%，且模型精度保持在0.48%-7%的范围内。

Conclusion: UnIT是一种高效且无需重新训练的解决方案，适用于在MCU上部署深度神经网络，并具备实际可行性。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Motivation: 为解决生成模型可能涉及的隐私、版权侵权问题，提出新方法探讨训练数据重构风险。

Result: 验证了低资源攻击的可能性，并揭示看似无害的提示词可能引发真实人像生成的风险。

Conclusion: 生成模型存在重大隐私和数据重构隐患，需加大对训练数据安全的关注与保护。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需分词的动态分块技术结合分层网络（H-Net），实现端到端训练的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型依赖分词处理，难以实现完全的端到端建模。

Method: 引入动态分块与分层网络（H-Net），用字节级别的层次结构替代分词-LM-去分词的流程，实现端到端模型学习。

Result: 在相同计算和数据条件下，字节级H-Net优于基于BPE分词的Transformer，多阶段分层还能进一步提升性能，且对字符级扰动更稳健，在中文、代码与DNA序列等领域数据效率显著提高。

Conclusion: H-Net可替代分词流程，通过学习数据依赖的分块策略，展现了端到端模型从原始数据中学习与扩展能力的潜力。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Motivation: 在离线到在线强化学习中，面临有效探索和样本高效学习的挑战，如何使用离线数据来获得良好的探索性策略仍是问题。

Method: 提出Q-chunking，将动作chunking技术应用于基于时序差分（TD）的强化学习方法，在chunked动作空间中运行RL，以实现更有效的探索和更加稳定的TD学习。

Result: 实验表明Q-chunking能够在多个长时间稀疏奖励任务中展现强大的离线表现和在线样本效率，优于以往的方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking方法通过结合离线数据和chunked动作技术，为长时间稀疏奖励任务的强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过调整预训练大语言模型（LLM）的结构，使其能够基于每个测试样本自适应调整深度，无需重新微调结果显著提升推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是探索能否通过灵活调整预训练神经网络的架构为不同输入自适应优化，而无需重新微调，从而提升推理效率及准确率。

Method: 利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）协议为每个测试样本优化链式层结构（CoLa），允许跳过、重复或重新堆叠预训练模型的层，以实现动态架构调整。

Result: (1) 超过75%的正确预测样本可以找到更短的模型路径，从而提高推理效率；(2) 超过60%的错误预测样本可以通过优化得到正确预测，从而显著提高性能。

Conclusion: 固定深度的预训练语言模型在处理不同样本时存在局限性，通过引入测试时间深度自适应的方法可以显著提升模型的效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一个用于加速尖峰神经网络（SNN）的框架，包含硬件架构和基于Pytorch的模型编译器，能够兼容低端FPGA并在MNIST任务中表现出高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统神经网络的计算需求大幅增加，尖峰神经网络（SNNs）作为一种高效的替代方案被提出，但其硬件实现存在可访问性和高成本问题。

Method: 设计了一种适用于低端FPGA的SNN加速架构，并提出一个基于Pytorch的SNN模型编译器。框架支持多种网络拓扑结构，依靠FPGA资源实现对尖峰信号的高效传播和模拟。

Result: 在低端Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA（100 MHz）上，框架实现了MNIST数据集上的高效速度（0.52 ms/img），并在玩具问题中准确模拟了手工编码的SNN。

Conclusion: 此框架以低成本FPGA实现了高效的SNN加速，具有广泛的社区可用性和实用性，代码和相关说明已公开发布。

Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased
significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential
solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1
spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate
operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for
more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating
and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and
SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider
community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve
as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many
proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN
topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN
acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting
any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a
synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture
targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.
The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves
competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further
experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking
neural networks on toy problems. All code and setup instructions are available

TL;DR: 该论文研究了神经处理中的能量限制与噪声关系，并提出了新的数学模型来解释神经元在能量约束条件下的行为变化，例如低功耗模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学模型无法准确描述神经群体在代谢资源受限和噪声条件下的动态行为，尤其是最近观察到的神经元在视觉皮层中表现的能量节约模式。

Method: 开发了一个理论群体编码框架，以能量预算模型为基础，结合生物物理模拟，将能量限制与噪声水平的变化关联，并通过分散泊松噪声模型和最优衰减路径推导出解析算法。

Result: 模型能够对神经元在调整能量预算和编码目标时的最佳编码策略进行分析，并解释实验中观测到的调谐曲线如何在保持稳态的同时适应变化。

Conclusion: 该方法成功捕捉了神经元在能量限制下如何调整其编码策略，以及这些调整如何与生物物理和电生理数据兼容。

Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by
metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not
accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example,
shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which
they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This
adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in
response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding
framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple
constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit
tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our
contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework
that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our
simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on
the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the
least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each
state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential
and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments
and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We
analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying
energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how
populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been
observed empirically.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Motivation: 因成像技术进步，数据量激增，需寻找有效数据存储方案。本研究动机是通过深度学习的方法解决工业X射线CT数据的存储问题，并探讨数据压缩对恢复质量的影响。

Method: 研究采用两种深度学习架构：深度卷积神经网络（D-CNN）和向量量化变分自动编码器（VQ-VAE），测试其对砂岩样本复杂孔隙网络XCT数据的压缩与恢复质量。同时引入对边缘保留敏感的指标评估图像结果。

Conclusion: 研究为科学家提供了关于数据存储和分析所需压缩和质量的策略建议，且所提边缘保留敏感指标对三维数据分析尤为重要。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督表示难以在表现能力与效率之间取得平衡，因此需要一种新的方法来增强高维图像的低维测量重建能力。

Method: 提出Tensor Decomposed多分辨率网格编码（GridTD），结合轻量级神经网络和多分辨率哈希网格编码的张量分解模型进行优化。

Conclusion: GridTD证明了其在多任务CI重建中的高效性和优越性，确立了其作为先进CI重建方法的地位。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
