### [1] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多级专家混合模型 (MMoE) 来解决现有多模态实体链接 (MEL) 方法在提及歧义性和模态内容动态选择上的缺陷，实现了多模态语义配对的动态和适应选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL模型难以处理提及的语义模糊性和动态选择模态信息的重要性等问题，这严重影响了多模态语义匹配的效果。

Method: 本文提出了MMoE方法，包括：(i) 基于大语言模型增强提及语义的模块；(ii) 融合文本和视觉特征的多模态特征提取模块；(iii) 和 (iv) 基于专家混合的特征动态选择机制，以区分和选择最相关的模态信息。

Result: 通过实验验证，与现有方法相比，MMoE在多模态实体链接任务中表现出了卓越的性能。

Conclusion: MMoE提供了一种有效的方法，动态适配多模态信息，以解决多模态语义匹配中的关键问题，成果代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

### [2] [CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125)
*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的协方差像素-文本损失（CoPT），用于基于文本嵌入学习域不变的图像分割特征，在UDA中取得了最新的性能突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语意分割中的UDA方法需要解决标注数据稀少且未能充分利用文本的域无关特性的问题。

Method: 提出了一个协方差像素-文本损失（CoPT），结合LLM生成的域描述文本和CLIP的文本嵌入，用以训练域不变图像分割编码器。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，使用CoPT训练的模型在语意分割的UDA任务中达到了最新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了文本嵌入的域无关性，显著提升了UDA的语意分割性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

### [3] [Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139)
*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 近期研究提出了一种名为Recall的新型对抗框架，通过优化跨模态的对抗图像提示，有效攻击未学习的图像生成模型（IGMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的图像生成模型在提升内容质量和多样性的同时，也带来了诸多伦理、法律和社会问题。为解决此类问题，机器未学习成为一个潜在解决方案，但其稳健性尚未充分探讨。

Method: 该研究提出利用未学习模型的多模态条件能力，通过单一语义相关的参考图像指导优化对抗图像提示，从而显著增强针对IGMs的对抗效果。

Result: 在十种最新未学习方法和多种任务上，Recall在对抗有效性、计算效率和语义保真度上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前未学习机制存在关键漏洞，需要更稳健的解决方案以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

### [4] [EEvAct: Early Event-Based Action Recognition with High-Rate Two-Stream Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07734)
*Michael Neumeier,Jules Lecomte,Nils Kazinski,Soubarna Banik,Bing Li,Axel von Arnim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种高效的双流尖峰神经网络（SNN），实现基于事件的早期人类活动识别，提升了准确率并验证了其实际应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决常规的事件处理方法限制早期预测能力的问题，同时提高尖峰神经网络的最终精确度，以更好地满足人机交互中对早期活动识别的需求。

Method: 开发了一种高频双流尖峰神经网络（SNN），通过在THU EACT-50大规模数据集上的实验，显著提高了识别的最终精度。同时，提出了一个新的早期事件识别框架，计算随着观察时间增长的Top-1和Top-5分类准确率。

Result: 新方法在THU EACT-50数据集上的最终准确率比之前方法提高了2%，并通过在人类运动捕捉早期触发的实际任务中验证了其影响力。

Conclusion: 高频双流尖峰神经网络（SNN）不仅提升了事件数据的早期活动识别性能，也在实际应用中展现了其潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

*Getamesay Haile Dagnaw,Yanming Zhu,Muhammad Hassan Maqsood,Wencheng Yang,Xingshuai Dong,Xuefei Yin,Alan Wee-Chung Liew*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文在生物医学图像分析领域对可解释性人工智能（XAI）进行了综合性综述，提出了一种以成像模式为中心的分类法，并探讨了多模态学习和视觉-语言模型的角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习在生物医学图像分析中的广泛应用，可解释性对于提高透明度、信任度和临床采纳性变得至关重要，然而现有综述没有充分关注不同成像模式以及多模态和视觉-语言方法的发展。

Conclusion: 这项综述为发展可解释深度学习在生物医学图像分析中的应用提供了全面基础，并为未来研究提出了若干挑战与方向。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

### [6] [Robust Multimodal Large Language Models Against Modality Conflict](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07151)
*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因模态冲突导致的幻觉现象，并提出了三种方法来缓解这种问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉-语言任务中表现出色，但在实际场景中容易出现幻觉现象。本文旨在研究输入中不同模态的固有冲突如何导致这种问题。

Method: 正式定义了模态冲突，并构造了一个名为多模态模态冲突（MMMC）的数据集来模拟这一现象。提出了基于提示工程、监督微调和强化学习的三种缓解方法。

Result: 通过在MMMC数据集上的大量实验，发现强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突下的幻觉问题上表现最佳，而监督微调方法则显示出有前景且稳定的表现。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了模态冲突这一容易被忽视的问题如何导致幻觉现象，并为提高MLLMs的鲁棒性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

### [7] [Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07153)
*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在GNSS不可用的情况下，通过UAV依靠视觉识别目标船只的方法，并在现实实验中验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的情况下进行海上自主检测和目标船只识别是搜救和威胁检测等领域的重要需求。

Method: 利用YOLOv8模型进行目标检测，通过特征匹配及色调直方图分析以确认目标船只，并基于几何原理定位目标船只。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023比赛的真实实验中，验证了所提出方法在GNSS拒止环境中的有效性，并对检测与定位精度的影响因素进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了GNSS不可用场景下的船只识别和精准定位，具有较好的现实适用性和性能。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

### [8] [CL-Polyp: A Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Network for Accurate Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07154)
*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习的CL-Polyp网络，用于提升肠镜影像中息肉分割的准确性，且不需要额外标注数据，实验表明其在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过降低对额外标注数据和任务相似性的依赖，提升现有基于深度学习的息肉分割方法的泛化能力。

Method: 提出CL-Polyp网络，结合对比学习增强编码器的表征能力，同时设计了MASPP模块以改进多尺度特征融合和CA模块以提升边界重建。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现出色，例如在Kvasir-SEG和CVC-ClinicDB提高了IoU指标0.011和0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp验证了对比学习策略在无需额外标注情况下提升息肉分割性能的可行性，展示了卓越的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

*Arshak Rezvani,Ali Akbari,Kosar Sanjar Arani,Maryam Mirian,Emad Arasteh,Martin J. McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种通过语义中介将EEG信号解码为图像的新方法，不依赖直接的EEG到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望克服EEG在空间分辨率上的不足，通过语义中介提高视觉解码的效果。

Method: 利用对比学习将EEG信号映射到语言模型生成的多层次语义描述，再通过预训练的扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码效果，并揭示了EEG信号和语义的头皮分布关系。

Conclusion: 该方法利用结构化的语义中介，有效实现了认知对齐的EEG信号视觉解码。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: 本文总结了视频生成领域内的32篇论文，分析了关键的架构组件和训练策略，提出了新颖的分类法，并比较了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频生成方法在生成16秒以上的视频时难以保持角色一致性和场景布局，同时多主体长视频的角色一致性和运动连贯性问题尤为突出。

Method: 通过研究32篇论文，构建了一种新颖的分类法，详细比较了这些方法的架构设计和性能特点。

Result: 总结了生成多角色、高叙事连贯性以及高保真性视频的关键元素，提供了性能分类对比表。

Conclusion: 提出的分类法和性能分析，为改进现有生成模型和开发新方法提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

### [11] [Colors See Colors Ignore: Clothes Changing ReID with Color Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07230)
*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于颜色信息的轻量方法，用以解决跨服装再识别中的外观偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨服装再识别（CC-ReID）方法依赖额外模型或标注来学习服装无关特征，但这导致资源消耗较大。

Method: 提出了一种名为“CSCI”的RGB图像方法，利用S2A自注意机制有效分离颜色与身份关联的特征，通过分析颜色嵌入与服装属性的对应性，验证其作为服装标签替代的有效性。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上的实验表明，该方法在无需额外监督的情况下分别提升了LTCC和PRCC上的Top-1精度2.9%和5.0%，在CCVID和MeVID上视频ReID指标分别提升1.0%和2.5%。

Conclusion: 颜色信息是解决CC-ReID外观偏差的代价低但高效的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Result: 减少了手动工作量，加速了初步合成的制作，并提供了全面的分割数据，提升了生产效率。

Conclusion: 该自动化流程快速被艺术家接受，显著提高VFX生产效率并优化工作流程。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) production often struggles with slow, resource-intensive
mask generation. This paper presents an automated video segmentation pipeline
that creates temporally consistent instance masks. It employs machine learning
for: (1) flexible object detection via text prompts, (2) refined per-frame
image segmentation and (3) robust video tracking to ensure temporal stability.
Deployed using containerization and leveraging a structured output format, the
pipeline was quickly adopted by our artists. It significantly reduces manual
effort, speeds up the creation of preliminary composites, and provides
comprehensive segmentation data, thereby enhancing overall VFX production
efficiency.

### [13] [DisenQ: Disentangling Q-Former for Activity-Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07262)
*Shehreen Azad,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过语言指导的多模态框架，用于在活动生物识别中更准确地区分身份信息，并在多个基准测试中取得了先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的身份识别在处理活动动态与外观变化时容易导致身份信息混淆，因此需要一种新的方法专注于解耦活动中的生物识别特征。

Method: 提出了DisenQ框架，通过语言引导的查询变压器，将生物识别、运动及非生物识别特征进行解耦，并消除了对额外视觉数据（如姿势和轮廓）的依赖。

Result: 在三项活动视频基准测试中获得了最先进的性能，并在传统的视频身份识别基准中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这种基于结构化语言的多模态方法能够有效减少传统方法中的识别误差，是活动生物识别领域的一个有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

*Ananya Raval,Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinguaMark 引入一个多语言 VQA 评估基准，测试了多个开源和闭源的大规模多模态模型的表现，发现闭源模型总体表现最好，但部分开源模型具备强适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在多语言支持上的表现有限，可能导致语言偏向和不公平的输出。

Method: 提出了一个名为 LinguaMark 的基准数据集，包括 6,875 个图文对，涵盖 11 种语言和五个社会属性，使用偏见、答案相关性和忠实性三项指标评估模型。

Result: 闭源模型总体表现最佳，而 Qwen2.5 等开源模型展现了较强的多语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: LinguaMark 提供了一个有力工具评估多模态模型的多语言能力，并推动这个方向的研究和公平性改进。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的MagiC揭示了视觉-语言模型在多模态认知推理中的局限性，同时为未来改进方向提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑中需要高效的自动化评估，但开源视觉-语言模型存在对齐问题，专有模型则缺乏透明性和成本优势，同时训练数据集的缺乏限制了模型性能优化。

Method: 提出了一种新的自动化数据集创建方法ADIEE，用其生成了超10万样本的大规模数据集，并用这一数据集微调了LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型，使其能基于自定义分数标记进行评估。

Conclusion: ADIEE方法及其评分模型不仅解决了现有模型的评估挑战，还展示了其在自动最优编辑选择和模型微调方面的潜力，对指令导向的图像编辑领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the

for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种对比强化学习方法来改进视觉故事系统的实体连接和一致性表现，显著提升模型在实体关联和叙述质量上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模视觉-语言模型在视觉故事生成中难以保持角色和物体的一致性，特别是在跨帧实体识别方面表现不足，主要原因是缺乏明确的训练机制。

Method: 提出对比强化学习框架，通过扩展Story Reasoning数据集生成负样本，采用直接偏好优化结合双组件奖励函数，一方面促进实体的正确关联，另一方面惩罚错误关联。用该方法微调了Qwen Storyteller模型。

Result: 在基线模型上，实体落地平均精度(mAP)从0.27提高到0.31，F1从0.35提高到0.41，实体跨帧一致性显著增强，特别是在更长帧数的情况下显著改善。同时，高质量的故事组织比例从79.1%升至97.5%。

Conclusion: 对比强化学习方法有效提升了视觉故事系统在包括代词指代、跨帧角色及物体一致性等核心问题上的性能，证明了这种方法在提升故事连贯性和精准性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Conclusion: PacGDC有效实现了泛化深度补全任务的新技术路径，提供了低标注成本和高性能的潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的方法，增加了自适应能力以改进解剖结构形状建模，同时保持粒子一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在形状表面的粒子配置上缺乏自适应性，难以准确表达复杂解剖变异性。

Method: 引入了两种机制：（1）一种新颖的邻域对应损失以提升自适应性；（2）一种地质对应算法以保持地质邻域一致性。

Result: 通过在高难度数据集上的表现，本文展示了新方法的高效性和可扩展性，并在表面表示准确性和对应性指标上与现有方法进行了对比。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了粒子的表面自适应能力，能够更精确地捕获复杂的解剖结构形状变异性。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件精确定位模型存在对时间域和空间域适应性不足的问题，需要开发能够整合多层次时间依赖和空间信息的模型。

Method: MSAGSM结合了多尺度时间扩展和多头空间注意力，能够同时捕捉短期与长期依赖，为2D特征提取器提供增强的时间和空间信息集成功能。

Result: 通过在五个事件精确定位基准上进行实验，MSAGSM显著提升了性能，设立了新的SOTA（最先进技术）结果。

Conclusion: MSAGSM作为一种轻量级插件模块，具有广泛的适用性和良好的性能，推动了运动视频事件精确定位领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Result: 实验验证了该模型在保留习惯特点及跨类运动迁移中的优越性。

Conclusion: 新方法有效保留了动物独特习惯，可用于更广泛的跨类运动迁移应用。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非受控照片集合获取容易，但因光照条件不一致和瞬间遮挡问题，场景分割较为困难，而现有方法无法有效处理这些问题，因此需要研究新的方法。

Method: 提出Seg-Wild方法，基于3D高斯点构建多维特征嵌入，计算与分割目标的特征相似性，实现3D场景的交互式分割。并引入Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC)，通过SAM掩码进行3D高斯修整。此外，还设计了新基准用于评估非受控场景的分割质量。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild能够在非受控场景中实现更优的分割效果，同时解决了瞬时遮挡和光照不一致等挑战，适用于真实世界场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法需要多阶段处理和复杂流程，未能很好考虑跨视角依赖，并且耗费计算资源。为了解决这些问题，提出了一种高效且一体化的视角生成与完成模型。

Method: 该方法通过输入层和特征层的掩码微调，实现端到端的模型训练，显著增强生成新视角和完成遮挡部分的能力。此外，该模型能够与其他图像到网格的模型集成，提高重构速度。

Result: 该方法在更小的数据集和批量训练下，仍实现了 occluded 任务中 PSNR 提高3.9，盒体 IoU 提高0.28，计算时间减少95%。

Conclusion: EscherNet++ 打破了传统管道复杂性限制，提供了性能优秀、通用能力强的视角生成和快速3D重建工具。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Conclusion: EPIC方法有效降低了资源消耗，同时在多个多模态分类任务中实现了卓越或相当的性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical
reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page:

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DSANet的算法，通过增强局部与全局特征间的语义交互，提高超声视频分割的抗噪能力，并在多个基准数据集上取得了显著的分割精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像虽然简单且无创，但固有的噪声问题对自动分割病灶或器官构成了重大挑战。

Method: 引入了一种双语义感知网络（DSANet）框架，通过邻近帧语义感知（AFSA）模块和局部与全局语义感知（LGSA）模块，增强特征融合和抗噪性。

Result: DSANet在四个基准数据集上的分割精度显著超越现有方法，同时推理速度也优于视频和部分图像基础的模型。

Conclusion: DSANet有效缓解了超声视频分割中的噪声问题，具有更高效的推理性能，提供了一种对噪声具有更强鲁棒性的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

TL;DR: 研究提出基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）模型的蓝白面纱（BWV）检测方法，用于改进黑色素瘤早期诊断，结果性能显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑色素瘤是致死性最高的皮肤癌之一，其诊断中蓝白面纱（BWV）是关键特征，但现有研究中针对皮肤图像中BWV检测方法有限，亟需高效自动化工具。

Method: 使用一种颜色阈值技术的图像算法将非标注数据集转换为标注数据集，设计并训练替换掉常规激活函数层的DCNN，用以检测BWV特征。此外，通过解释性人工智能（XAI）方法分析DCNN的决策过程。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高BWV检测准确性，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了一种强有力的工具，优于现有检测模型，同时增强了结果的可解释性。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Objectomaly的新方法，用于改进出分布（OoD）分割主要存在的边界不精确、对象内异常分数不一致以及背景噪声引起的误报等问题，并取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于掩码方法在OoD分割任务中表现不佳，存在边界不精确、对象分数不一致及背景噪声带来的误报等问题。提升OoD分割的精准性对于安全至关重要的应用如自动驾驶具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一个包含三个阶段的Objectomaly框架：(1) 通过现有OoD模型进行粗略异常评分；(2) 使用SAM生成的实例掩码进行对象感知的评分校准；(3) 应用拉普拉斯滤波和高斯平滑实现边界精细化。

Result: Objectomaly在SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack和RoadAnomaly等关键OoD分割基准上取得了最先进的性能，包括像素级（AuPRC高达96.99，FPR$_{95}$低至0.07）和组件级（F1分数高达83.44）指标的显著提升。消融研究和真实驾驶视频的定性结果进一步验证了方法的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: Objectomaly框架有效克服了现有OoD分割方法的不足，通过引入对象级先验信息和精细化边界处理，显著提升了分割精度和鲁棒性，为安全关键应用提供了可靠的解决方案。代码将在论文发表后发布。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

### [33] [Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464)
*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究旨在优化智能监控系统中的面部识别技术，应对恶劣天气条件，通过推出一种新的基于GAN的无参考面部图像复原模型，显著提高了在这些场景下的图像处理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对恶劣天气条件对图像质量和识别精度的负面影响，研究提出了一种专注于天气退化问题的面部图像复原方法，以消除面部纹理和结构失真。

Method: 研究提出了基于GAN的创新框架，包括两个核心模块：局部统计面部特征变换（SFFT）模块，用于通过统计分布对齐提升结构与颜色的一致性；退化无关特征嵌入（DAFE）模块，用于在恶劣天气下增强鲁棒的面部特征提取。

Result: 实验结果表明，该研究方法在压制纹理扭曲与准确重建面部结构方面，超越了目前最先进的GAN和扩散模型复原方法。SFFT和DAFE模块的有效性也通过实验进一步验证。

Conclusion: 新提出的SFFT模型能够显著提升恶劣天气条件下的面部修复表现，为面部图像处理领域提供了有力的新工具。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频数据未经授权被深度追踪器使用的隐私问题，这是现有方法的一大欠缺领域。

Method: 提出一种新型生成框架生成时间不可学习样本(TUEs)，并通过引入时间对比损失强化TUEs效果，以防止深度追踪器准确学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护上达到了目前最优性能，并具有很强的迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护了训练视频数据的隐私，为视频深度学习场景提供了安全保障。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Conclusion: GGMotion因其组图设计和物理先验能力有效缓解了人体运动建模中的物理不合理问题，表现优越、推广性强。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD

Conclusion: 提出的样条轨迹表示法通过减少时间波动及优化时间插值性能，使动态场景重建更具空间连贯性，且无需依赖传统线性混合蒙皮或其他严格约束。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLM在抽象推理任务中表现受限的问题，尤其是视觉嵌入的线性可分性如何影响它们在推理任务上的表现。

Method: 引入线性可分性天花板（Linear Separability Ceiling，LSC）作为分析工具，通过线性分类器评估视觉嵌入，并分析语义概念和复杂推理任务下的干预要求。

Result: 发现VLM的推理问题源于语言模型的推理路径，而非感知能力的欠缺。同时证明复杂推理任务需要调整模型核心权重，而语义任务只需激活现有推理路径即可。

Conclusion: 强大的推理能力更多取决于目标导向的对齐而非简单的表示学习改进。本文还为VLM分析提供了一个新思路。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HOTA方法结合SegFormer模型与双约束深度估计模块用于高精度3D洪水制图，实验显示性能显著改善，可快速响应洪水灾害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有洪水制图方法难以兼顾大范围覆盖和空间细节信息，且通常忽略洪水深度估计，亟需一种能生成高精度3D洪水图的方法。

Method: 提出HOTA方法，通过多尺度重叠拼接推理，结合Sentinel-2数据的SegFormer模型捕捉局部与大范围特征，并通过基于DEM的深度估计模块提升结果精度。

Result: 在澳大利亚Kempsey地区实验显示HOTA与SegFormer的结合将IoU从73%提高至84%，边界误差小于0.5m。

Conclusion: HOTA方法实现了高精度且覆盖大范围的3D洪水制图，为提升灾害响应效率提供了强大支持。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过提升标签质量和使用简单但有效的步骤，证明了传统VLMs在激光雷达扫描分割任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

TL;DR: 本文提出SpatialViz-Bench，一种用于评估多模态大语言模型(MMLMs)空间可视化能力的全面基准，发现这些模型在空间任务上表现出诸多不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态大语言模型在空间可视化能力的评估上较欠缺，现有评估方法可能涉及训练数据，无法真实衡量模型能力。

Method: 设计了一个名为SpatialViz-Bench的新基准，包含12项任务与4个子能力，生成了1180个自动问题，用于评估33个最先进MMLMs的空间可视化能力。

Result: 揭示了模型性能的广泛差异与反直觉行为，如感知难度与人类直觉不符、2D到3D表现断崖，以及空间任务中默认基于公式推导的倾向。

Conclusion: 最先进的MMLMs在空间可视化任务中仍存在显著缺陷，SpatialViz-Bench为该领域提供了重要的基准以推动发展。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型存在不确定性量化和错误预测的挑战。

Method: 提出ViLU框架，通过交叉注意力整合视觉和文本嵌入，训练一个二分类的不确定性预测器。适用于只有视觉和文本嵌入的后处理场景。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法相比现有错误预测方法表现出显著优势，包括ImageNet-1k, CC12M和LAION-400M。

Conclusion: ViLU方法架构和训练策略对有效的不确定性量化至关重要，并通过实验验证其效果。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Motivation: 现有方法局限于特定领域或强依赖于文本指导，难以捕捉运动细节，导致不现实的重构。

Method: 设计了一种基于语义的稀疏运动采样机制，提取基于语义重要性的稀疏轨迹点，并在扩散过程中融入轨迹对齐约束，保证生成的视频运动模式合理。

Result: 实验表明该框架优于传统编解码器和最先进的端到端视频压缩方法，尤其在超低比特率环境下表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的T-GVC框架不仅降低比特率，还能实现精准的运动控制，是生成视频编码的新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Motivation: 现有深度学习FER系统在不同年龄群体间，特别是老年群体中存在不公平的识别偏差，需要改进以提升系统的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 研究年龄群体的识别性能差异，采用XAI分析具体表情和注意模式偏差，并提出三种缓解方法：多任务学习、多模态输入、年龄加权损失，结合大规模AffectNet数据进行训练和测试。

Result: 提出的策略显著提高了老年群体的表情识别准确率，特别是在“中性”、“悲伤”和“愤怒”等易错表情上；热图分析表明使用年龄感知策略的模型更关注相关面部区域。

Conclusion: 通过简单的训练调整措施，即使是低精度的年龄标签也能有效缓解FER中的年龄偏见，从而促进大规模情感计算系统的公平性。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Conclusion: MolCLIP首次将显微视频和药物分子模态融合，在药物机制研究中表现出明显优势，为相关领域研究提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Conclusion: 整合AUs知识可以显著提高动态面部表情识别精度，并通过重新设计损失函数有效应对标签失衡问题。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 研究改进多模态链式思维（CoT）推理能力，提出了新解码策略RED，显著提升了准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的多模态推理能力有限，特别是在整合视觉和文本信息时忽视了生成的推理依据内容，需要一种改进方案提高模型的合理性和准确性。

Method: 通过将多模态CoT推理重新定义为KL约束的奖励最大化问题，提出了基于依据条件概率的新解码策略RED，同时整合视觉和推理依据信息。

Result: 实验表明，RED在多个基准测试中明显优于传统CoT和其他解码方法，增强了推理的准确性和真实性。

Conclusion: RED提供了一种有效的推理增强方案，为构建更可靠且基于推理依据的多模态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

*Wei Shang,Dongwei Ren,Wanying Zhang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像去模糊方法，结合了区域模糊检测和运动分析，在提升去模糊效果的同时降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去模糊方法在分配计算资源和处理空间可变模糊模式上存在不足，难以高效处理局部运动模糊问题。

Method: 设计了一个可训练的模糊区域预测器用于检测模糊区域，并采用结构化重参数化降低计算开销，同时开发了帧内运动分析器以基于像素位移指导区域特定的模糊恢复。此外，模型通过多种损失函数（重建损失、重模糊损失和掩膜损失）进行端到端训练。

Result: 在局部和全局模糊数据集上，实验表明该方法优于当前最先进的方法，同时相比于LMD-ViT等模型将计算量减少了49%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新模糊检测和去模糊策略，不仅提升了模型去模糊性能，还显著减少了计算成本，具有良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrossVLAD，一个从MSCOCO提取并结合GPT-4注释的新基准数据集，用于统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）的跨任务对抗攻击评价，并提出了高效的跨任务区域攻击方法CRAFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于VLMs可以通过指令机制灵活处理多种任务，潜在的对抗输入因此需在多个不可预测的任务指令中生效，这带来了独特的安全挑战。作者旨在评估并解决这一问题。

Method: 引入CrossVLAD基准数据集用于评估跨任务对抗攻击，同时提出CRAFT跨任务基于区域的攻击框架，使用Token对齐技术提高攻击效果。

Result: 在Florence-2及其他主流VLMs上的实验表明，该方法在跨任务攻击性能和目标对象变更成功率方面均超过现有方法。

Conclusion: CrossVLAD数据集和CRAFT方法提升了对抗攻击在不同任务中的广泛适应性，为VLMs的安全性研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在处理长视频上存在局限性，亟需开发更强大的推理能力以应对长视频相关的复杂场景和多样需求。

Method: 引入了包括三个核心组件的框架：(1) LongVideo-Reason数据集，含52K长视频QA对，覆盖多领域高质量推理标注；(2) 两阶段训练，包括链式思维监督微调（CoT-SFT）和强化学习；(3) 适用于长视频强化学习的MR-SP训练基础设施，通过序列并行和基于vLLM的视频嵌入缓存优化训练效率。

Result: 实验中，LongVILA-R1-7B在长视频QA基准测试（如VideoMME）上表现卓越，在多个推理维度上超越Video-R1-7B，甚至匹敌Gemini-1.5-Pro。此外，MR-SP系统在长视频强化学习上实现了高达2.1倍的加速。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1向长视频推理领域迈出了重要的一步，并提供了一个支持多模态RL训练的公共基础设施。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏全面评估视觉语言模型视觉推理能力的基准工具。

Method: 提出TreeBench基准，包含复杂场景检测、可追溯证据及二阶推理测试，同时引入TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习共同监督定位与推理过程。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Result: 揭示了医疗图像开源数据集中可能存在的偏差，并促进更可解释的研究。

Conclusion: 此研究强调了在医疗图像领域需要创建更多开源数据集的重要性，并鼓励更专注于实际病理的AI研究。

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SAM模型仅适用于2D图像，不适合3D体积数据（如CT或MRI），且现有3D方法复杂，推理时间较长。

Method: 借鉴SegVol理念，设计了一种改进的3D分割方法，避免滑动窗口等复杂策略，实现性能和效率的平衡。

Result: 新方法显著降低了推理时间，同时在性能上达到最先进水准。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为简化3D分割任务提供了高效解决方案，有助于提升医疗影像分割的实用性。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 当前大规模视觉语言模型在对象幻觉问题上的表现受到解码方法限制、视觉输入复杂改动或外部知识依赖的影响，难以实现平衡性和准确性，需寻求改进方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于能量的解码方法，该方法动态选择隐藏层中能量分数最低的状态以减少偏差，同时提升VQA任务的性能。

Result: 在POPE、MME和MMVP这三个基准数据集上的平均准确率提高了4.82%，“Yes”比例偏差减少8.81%，验证了方法的有效性和减少偏差的能力。

Conclusion: 新的能量解码方法能够有效改善大规模视觉语言模型的偏差问题，在多个基准测试中均表现优越，展现了较强的提升潜力。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视频时间定位(VTG)的新方法——稀疏-致密侧调节器(SDST)，在多个基准数据集上实现了高效和领先的性能，同时显著减少了参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多依赖于冻结的大型预训练主干网络的最终层特征，缺乏对新领域的适应性；完全微调代价过高，因此需要探索更高效的微调方式。

Method: 引入SDST作为第一个用于VTG的无锚点侧调节(ST)架构，并提出参考基点可变自注意力(Reform-based Deformable Self-Attention)机制。此外，将InternVideo2 backbone集成到ST框架中，实现了性能提升。

Result: 在QVHighlights、TACoS和Charades-STA等数据集上取得了具有竞争力或较先进的性能，同时与现有SOTA方法相比减少了高达73%的参数量。

Conclusion: 本文方法显著提升了效率和性能，为VTG任务提供了更优的解决方案并公开了代码以供验证。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: X-RAFT方法有效降低了不同模态图像匹配的误差，并将在荧光引导神经外科手术中提升量化荧光测量的可靠性。

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Motivation: 增材制造中几何偏差（如缩减和变形）会影响组件性能，而CAD与XCT配准是确保质量控制的重要方法，经典方法在计算负担和配准精度上具有挑战性，需要改进。

Method: 采用基于深度学习的动态分块处理策略处理高分辨率体积，使用Dice Score和二值差异图（Binary Difference Map, BDM）评价配准精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习DVC技术奠定基础，可用于增材制造生产过程中的闭环相关分析，提高了生产的可靠性和效率，节约了时间和材料。

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了在没有传统范数约束下的不受限对抗攻击，并提出了SCOOTER框架来评估这些攻击的影响及感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不受限对抗攻击打破了以范数为基础的防御策略，因此需要一种统一且客观的评估方法来衡量其对人类感知的影响并支持比较。

Method: 提出了SCOOTER框架，通过人类研究和GPT模型结合，统计评估不受限对抗攻击的感知效果，并提供相关工具和数据集用于支持研究。

Result: 通过346名参与者实验发现，攻击生成的对抗样本对人类不可感知性较差，与自动化视觉系统的结果不一致。

Conclusion: 自动化视觉系统与人类感知之间存在显著差距，需要SCOOTER框架作为基准，以便更深入地研究人类与AI之间的差异并改进对抗攻击手段的评估。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: 本文提出S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，专注于语言引导的复杂3D场景空间推理分割，解决当前数据集存在的语义线索与空间关系混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D视觉语言研究中，现有数据集因混淆语义线索与空间关系，导致模型难以真正理解空间关系。本文旨在专注研究语言与3D感知中未充分探索的空间推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为S\textsc{urprise}3D的新数据集，包含超过200k个视觉语言对和89k+人工注释的空间查询，强调不依赖对象名称；并设计3D-SRS基准套件评估空间推理分割能力。

Result: 基准测试结果显示，当前最先进的3D视觉定位方法在新数据集上的表现仍有较大挑战，验证了数据集和基准的必要性。

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D和3D-SRS有助于促进空间感知AI的发展，推动体感交互和机器人规划的有效性。

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D卷积神经网络的端到端rPPG提取网络，能够从面部视频中准确重构rPPG信号，并在复杂场景下展现了优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非接触式rPPG技术难以在复杂场景中保证心率测量的准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出使用3D卷积神经网络结合差分帧融合模块和具有自注意力机制的时间偏移模块提取rPPG信号。此外，设计了一种动态混合损失函数，增强网络的监督效果并减少过拟合。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG和复杂场景下的MMPD数据集上进行了全面实验，显示该网络具有卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是训练于PURE数据集时，在MMPD测试集上的MAE达到了7.58，优于当前最优模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的rPPG提取框架在准确性和鲁棒性上超越了现有技术，可以更有效地适应复杂的应用场景。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出一种新的高效参数微调方法，用于视觉变换器，通过生成针对每个输入的实例感知提示，并与数据集级提示融合，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的方法使用统一的数据集级提示对所有输入相同，但未能有效应对下游数据集的高变异性。

Method: 提出了Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT)，通过PCA降低维度保留关键信息，生成实例感知提示，与数据集级提示进行融合。

Result: 在34个不同数据集上的实验均优于现有最先进方法，其性能全面超越基线方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT在平衡数据集级与实例级信息的同时，通过减少参数学习量有效优化视觉提示分析，是一种新型、优越的方法。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Synergistic Prompting (SyP)的框架，旨在解决多模态模型在输入模态缺失时性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型在模态缺失情况下表现不佳，而现有的基于提示的方法适应性和可靠性有限，无法有效解决此问题。

Method: 设计了Synergistic Prompting (SyP)框架，引入动态适配器生成动态提示并结合静态提示来平衡模态信息，提升多模态模型的适应性和稳健性。

Result: SyP在三个主流视觉识别数据集上表现优异，特别是在多种缺失模态条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: SyP框架有效解决了多模态输入缺失问题，具有出色的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究首次将视觉Transformer应用于无标记肺部肿瘤运动预测，通过对比个性化模型(PS)和多患者模型(MP)在实际临床环境中的表现，证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用视觉Transformer提升无标记肺部肿瘤运动预测的精度，并解决不同患者之间的解剖变异问题。

Method: 使用31名患者的规划4DCT数据生成的数字重建射线图(DRRs)训练MP模型，并以第32名患者数据进行评估。PS模型则使用目标患者的规划数据进行训练。每种模型以16张DRR为输入，预测肿瘤未来1秒的运动轨迹，并用ADE和FDE衡量性能。

Result: PS模型在规划数据集(T1)上的表现优于MP模型，尤其是在数据量较大时（p<0.05）；但MP模型对解剖变化更具鲁棒性，在治疗数据集(T2)上无需重新训练即可达到相近的性能。

Conclusion: PS模型适合追求精度的场景，而MP模型则更适合时间紧张的临床环境，展现了良好的通用性，推动了视觉Transformer在此领域的应用。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Method: 引入拼图碎片丢失、边缘损毁及内容侵蚀三种复杂情况，评估传统启发式方法和深度学习拼图求解器的应对能力及不足。

Result: 发现传统拼图求解器在复杂场景中的表现迅速下降，而深度学习模型通过数据增强训练显著改进其鲁棒性，尤其是Positional Diffusion模型在实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究指出当前拼图求解方法的局限性，并提出通过数据增强及模型优化可以提升系统应对真实世界复杂挑战的能力，同时为文物修复及文件还原领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有基于transformer的持续图像分割方法中存在的塑性丧失和对输入数据顺序的高依赖性问题。

Method: 通过直接从图像中选择特征用于查询分配，并引入跨阶段一致性和创新的基于视觉查询的回放机制，以增强模型的学习能力和减少灾难性遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，SimCIS在多种分割任务、设置和数据分割条件下都表现出更优秀的性能。

Conclusion: SimCIS不仅保持了对象性，还提高了对新类别的适应能力，为持续图像分割任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Motivation: 当前工业制造中的表面缺陷检出方法在实际中表现不佳，且缺乏能反映真实工业场景的高质量RGB+3D数据集。

Method: 创建了一个包含14,120个高分辨率扫描和27,346个缺陷注释实例的3D-ADAM数据集，覆盖了多种工业缺陷类别，并模拟了真实工业环境中的多种变化。

Result: 基于3D-ADAM数据集对多种SOTA模型进行了评估，结果表明当前方法在该数据集上的表现仍面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为工业3D异常检测提供了一个具有挑战性的新基准，旨在推动更鲁棒的模型开发以满足现代制造业需求。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: THUNDER为数字病理学研究提供了一种可靠且动态的基准方法，有望促进领域的进一步发展，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Motivation: 现有水下图像恢复算法在复杂几何场景和显著深度变化下存在计算复杂高、生成伪影等问题。

Method: 通过新型网络架构SLURPP将预训练的潜在扩散模型与显式场景分解相结合，同时设计基于物理的图像合成管道，生成多样化的训练数据用于模型训练。

Result: SLURPP在synthetic基准上提供了3 dB的PSNR提升，并且相比现有扩散方法快超200倍，在真实数据上也实现了显著的质的提升。

Conclusion: SLURPP在水下图像恢复领域展现了显著的性能和效率提升，且克服了现有方法在复杂场景下的主要限制。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态智能检索与增强(MIRA)框架，旨在解决当前多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在医学诊断中生成与事实不符的回答问题，并显著提升其在医学VQA和报告生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MLLMs在医学诊断场景中存在生成内容与事实不符的情况，虽然引入检索增强生成（RAG）可以提高准确性，但也存在检索过多或过少以及过度依赖检索数据导致事实错误的问题。

Method: 研究提出了MIRA框架，包含两个关键模块：(1) 重新思考与重新调整模块，用于动态调节检索内容数量；(2) 集成图像嵌入和医学知识库的医疗RAG框架，结合查询重写模块以实现高效的多模态推理。

Result: 通过在公开的医学VQA和报告生成基准测试上的实验，MIRA显著提升了事实准确性和综合表现，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MIRA框架证明了在医学场景中优化事实准确性的有效性，为提升多模态大语言模型在医学应用的可信度提供了新方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a

Result: 通过在五个多样化数据集上的广泛实验，该方法在无需访问源数据的情况下实现领先的实时自监督适应性能。

Conclusion: Cici框架在解决rPPG任务的测试时适应问题时展现了出色效果，为实际应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

Motivation: 通过整合行为和生理监测，在实验环境中动态、精确地了解疾病进程和疗法效果，但鼠类难以单独识别。

Method: 提出了一种实时识别算法，包括：1. 鼠类运动状态追踪模型（MouseTracks）；2. 基于Transformer的识别模型（Mouseformer）；3. 基于线性规划的ID分配模型（MouseMap）。

Result: 该系统以30帧/秒的速度实现实时鼠类ID分配，并展示其在多种因素下的高效监测能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新跟踪与识别系统提高了实验鼠的追踪效率和ID识别准确性，为动物实验监测提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Motivation: 生成逼真的火星地貌视频以便于任务演练和机器人仿真，但面临火星高质量数据稀缺和与地球图像域差异巨大的挑战。

Method: 提出M3arsSynth和MarsGen两个组件：M3arsSynth用于重建3D火星地貌并渲染高保真3D视频；MarsGen则基于初始帧生成逼真和几何一致的新视频，并支持摄像机轨迹或文本提示输入。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Geometry Forcing的方法，通过几何特征对齐来提升视频扩散模型对3D结构的内在表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型通常仅基于二维视频数据的训练，难以捕捉视频中所隐含的3D几何结构。

Method: 通过引入几何特征对齐的约束，包括角度对齐（Angular Alignment）和尺度对齐（Scale Alignment），将扩散模型的表征与预训练的几何基础模型特征对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Geometry Forcing方法在相机视图与动作条件的视频生成任务中显著提升了视频生成的视觉质量与3D一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地弥合了视频扩散模型与物理世界3D本质之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OST-Bench，这是一个评估在线时空理解的基准，强调模型在逐步获取观测数据下的动态空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数评估多模态大语言模型的基准仅限于离线状态评估，而OST-Bench旨在提出一个更贴合实际场景的在线评估方法，强调模型中在线处理和动态空间理解的重要性。

Method: OST-Bench基准由1.4k个场景和来自不同数据源的10k个问答对组成，评估多模态大语言模型在逐步探索场景下的表现。

Result: 现有模型在需要复杂时空推理的任务上表现不足，并且随着在线探索范围和记忆增长，其精度显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前模型在线性化的长期记忆检索和复杂的空间推理方面存在瓶颈，OST-Bench为这些挑战提供了评估基础并促进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了CLIP模型在表示学习中的绑定问题，并通过合成数据集分析数据特性对绑定性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP模型被广泛应用，但由于其学习的表征是词袋模型，导致它难以区分对象的特定上下文组合，如“黄色潜水艇和蓝色巴士”与“蓝色潜水艇和黄色巴士”。现有方法未能彻底解决绑定问题，因而需从数据特性入手探索原因。

Method: 通过构建合成数据集，研究常见数据属性对CLIP模型绑定能力的影响，例如属性密度、标签完整性和显著性偏差等。并验证不同数据处理策略对模型表现的效果。

Result: 研究发现自然数据的某些特性，如低属性密度、不完整的标签和人类描述偏差会削弱绑定性能。此外，增加批量大小或显式创建硬负例无法显著提升绑定性能。

Conclusion: 仅当数据具备研究识别出的特定属性时，CLIP才能学到几乎完美的绑定能力。这表明了解数据特性在解决绑定问题中的重要性。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频大语言模型因令牌数量导致的计算扩展性问题，利用视频数据中的局部时空冗余性提升效率。

Method: 通过四叉树结构局部搜索进行多粒度的空间令牌合并，并采用分步时空合并方式优化令牌数。

Result: 在六个视频QA基准测试中表现超越现有方法，实现了2倍提速仅损失0.5%的准确性，以及3倍提速损失2%的准确性。

Conclusion: STTM实现了高效的时空令牌优化方案，不仅加速了推理，还支持不同问题的缓存复用。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑视觉解码评估协议未能捕捉细粒度视觉差异，缺乏神经科学基础，且使用粗略指标，难以区分模型性能的差异。

Method: 提出了BASIC评估框架，包括基于分割的多层次度量（如前景、语义、实例和组件掩码）及基于多模态大模型的语义场景表达，以实现更细致和情境丰富的解码性能比较。

Result: 使用BASIC框架对不同视觉解码方法在多种刺激-神经成像数据集上进行基准测试，展现其鉴别性和解释性优势。

Conclusion: BASIC框架为脑视觉解码方法提供了更具有鉴别力、解释性和综合性的新评估标准。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大多数视觉表示学习系统使用固定长度的表示，忽视了数据复杂性和熟悉度的变化。基于Kolmogorov复杂性，作者希望设计一种高效的分词算法，实现适应性表示。

Method: 提出了一种称为KARL的单次传递适应性分词算法，该算法在图像重建质量目标下学习预测合适的分词停止点，通过近似Kolmogorov复杂性决定代币数量。

Result: KARL在单次传递下实现了与其他先进适应性分词算法相当的性能，并系统分析了其扩展定律（如编码器/解码器大小、连续与离散分词等）。

Conclusion: KARL在性能与效率兼具的情况下建立了适应性图像分词与算法信息论之间的关联，其预测的图像复杂性符合人类直觉。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Conclusion: \NickName显著增强了VQ-VAE的图像重建能力，为高保真图像处理任务奠定了基础，演示了其在高分辨率图像中的潜力。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,

TL;DR: 本文探讨CLIP及大型多模态模型（LMMs）在组合概念语境下的表现，证明词共现统计（PMI值）对模型性能有显著影响。

Motivation: 研究CLIP和LMMs在组合概念下的泛化能力，以及训练集中概念组合对模型性能的潜在影响。

Method: 利用合成图像和自然图像实验，通过分析训练数据中的点互信息（PMI），量化概念组合在模型预训练数据中的重要性，并关联模型性能与PMI值的关系。

Result: 发现PMI值与零样本准确性强相关性：基于LAION-400M的CLIP模型训练数据显示r=0.97，最高与最低5％PMI图像的准确率相差14%。在自然图像实验中，编辑图片以变化PMI值，相关性达r=0.75。此外，这种行为在基于CLIP构建的LMMs中也有转移（TextVQA: r=0.70, VQAv2: r=0.62）。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够在不显著增加数据规模的情况下改进多模态模型组合泛化能力的算法与架构。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）中的认知偏差来源，提出了双步骤因果实验方法，表明偏差主要由预训练阶段决定，而非微调或随机性。

Motivation: 探明LLMs认知偏差的来源，以帮助开发更科学的评估与偏差缓解策略。

Method: 研究通过双步骤因果实验法：1）改变随机种子多次微调模型分析随机训练对认知偏差的影响，2）通过数据集交换微调（cross-tuning）测试偏差是否受特定数据集影响。

Result: 发现尽管随机性引入了一些变异，但模型的认知偏差模式主要由预训练阶段决定，与微调数据的相关性较低。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs偏差主要源于预训练的结论，强调在评估和减轻偏差时需关注预训练过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了使用大型语言模型(LLMs)进行社会科学调查时的可靠性和偏差问题，通过测试九种LLM并对问题和答案结构进行扰动，发现了模型的脆弱性和一贯的"末项偏好"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在社会科学调查中作为代理人时的表现及其对已知偏差的敏感性，旨在评估其可靠性和稳定性。

Method: 测试了九种多样化的LLM，基于世界价值观调查(WVS)中的问题，实施了11种扰动，模拟了超过16.7万次访谈，以评估模型的稳定性和偏差表现。

Result: 所有测试模型都对问题的语义变化和扰动组合表现出敏感性，并且一致地展示了"末项偏好"。尽管较大的模型一般更具鲁棒性，但仍然存在显著问题。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs生成合成调查数据时，提示的设计和鲁棒性测试尤为重要，因为即便是较大的模型仍然容易受到外界因素的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为SynthTextEval的工具包，用于全面评估合成文本的多维表现，尤其在高风险领域如医疗和法律中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在高风险领域中开发与部署AI时可能引发的隐私问题，需要一种方法来有效评估合成文本的多维表现。

Method: 开发了一个名为SynthTextEval的工具包，可以通过用户上传或工具生成的合成数据，进行多维评估，包括下游系统的效用、公平性、隐私泄露风险等。

Result: SynthTextEval能够标准化和集中化评估指标，展示了在医疗和法律等高风险领域进行合成文本评估的功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过改进合成文本的评估方法，SynthTextEval促进了隐私保护和AI开发的可行性。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了专为医学领域定制的安全评估协议和数据集，通过针对患者、临床医生以及普通用户的视角对医学大型语言模型（LLMs）进行安全性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在医学领域的广泛应用以及潜在的安全隐患，尤其在不同用户角色和健康影响方面，亟需一种专门针对医学领域的安全评估方法。

Method: 研究通过开发名为PatientSafetyBench的数据集，包括466个样本，覆盖5个关键类别，并采用医学领域的红队测试协议，对MediPhi模型集合进行了案例研究。

Result: 研究首次定义了医学LLMs的安全评估标准，综合评估了患者、临床医生和普通用户的不同视角下的安全性表现。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了医学LLMs安全性评估的空白，为医学领域中更安全的模型部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了单对话和多组对话环境中的打断检测，并提出了一种能适应重叠语音环境的最先进方法，可用于课堂监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于打断检测的研究多局限于单对话环境，语音相对干净，但真实课堂中存在多组并发对话，需要开发适用于复杂环境的解决方案来辅助教育。

Method: 研究分析了打断检测在单对话和多组对话情境下的表现，结合语言和韵律信息，提出了一种能适应重叠语音的检测方法。

Result: 提出的方法在处理重叠语音时表现卓越，为教育环境中应用AI监测对话提供了可能。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅验证了新方法的有效性，还揭示了协作学习对话中打断的语言和韵律特征，并为后续研究指引了方向。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在生成反驳语时，证据有限且输出控制力弱，亟需更有效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了多代理检索增强框架，结合静态和动态证据，通过优化知识检索、证据增强和响应优化来生成反驳语。

Result: 模型在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性方面超越基线。

Conclusion: 新方法生成的反驳语更高质量，且人类评价显示，响应优化环节显著提升了最终输出的质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的模型，用以高效处理长文本，其与现有SOTA模型性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer因输入长度导致计算复杂度过高的问题，优化处理长文档的效率。

Method: 提出一种整合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，结合实时图生成机制，并利用LLM提供的嵌入信息，通过字典查询提升效率。

Result: 生成的图具有良好的语义组织结构（平均聚类系数0.45，最短路径长度约4-5），实验显示在文本分类任务中，性能与现有SOTA模型相当。

Conclusion: 该模型在保持高效率的同时，展示了竞争性能，为长文本处理提供了一种新的高效方案。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedReadCtrl框架，能根据可读性调整LLM输出的复杂性，同时保持医疗内容的精准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式AI在人类与AI之间的有效沟通问题，尤其是在个性化和可理解性方面的挑战。

Method: 开发了一个名为MedReadCtrl的框架，通过可读性控制指令调整语言生成模型（LLM）的输出复杂性，以实现内容精准与个性化的平衡。

Result: 与GPT-4相比，MedReadCtrl在可读性指令遵循性错误上下降显著（如ReadMe: 1.39 vs. 1.59, p<0.001），并在医学任务（如MTSamples）上实现了大幅性能提升（ROUGE-L+14.7，SARI+6.18）。专家评价显示，特别是在低读写能力的场景下，71.7%的偏好倾向于MedReadCtrl。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能将医学内容转化为可读性适中的语言形式，既保持了医学意图，又提升了可访问性，为患者教育和公平且可扩展的AI医疗提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SynthEHR-Eviction，一个结合了LLM、人类标注和自动提示优化的可扩展管道，用于从临床笔记中提取驱逐状态，并创建了最大驱逐相关SDoH数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是一个重要但少被研究的健康社会决定因素（SDoH），与住房不稳定、失业和心理健康有关。现有电子健康记录中缺乏驱逐的结构化编码，限制了后续应用的潜能。

Method: 设计了SynthEHR-Eviction这一管道，结合了大语言模型（LLM）、人工循环注释和自动提示优化，以高效从临床笔记中提取相关信息。此外还创建了包含14个精细类别的公共SDoH数据集。

Result: 调整后的LLM在SynthEHR-Eviction上的Macro-F1分数在驱逐识别中达到88.8%，在其他SDoH识别中达到90.3%，均优于多种基准模型。同时，管道减少了80%以上的标注工作负担。

Conclusion: SynthEHR-Eviction管道加速了驱逐相关数据集的创建，实现了可扩展的驱逐状态检测，并具有广泛的任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: 显示了小型语言模型在时间序列理解和解释中应用的可行性，这为开发此类模型提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

TL;DR: 提出了Self-taught ActioN Deliberation（SAND）框架，通过LLM进行候选行动的深思熟虑以改进选择的准确性，提供了20%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的调优方法在有限的行为探索中容易过度承认看似合理但次优的结果，该研究旨在解决此问题。

Method: 提出一种名为SAND的框架，利用自一致性动作采样和执行指导的动作评估来生成逐步的动作推理，然后利用这些推理轨迹再次对LLM进行微调。

Result: 在两个互动型代理任务中，SAND框架比初始监督调优平均提高了20%，并且超越了当前最先进的代理调优方法。

Conclusion: SAND框架通过促使LLM在最终选定动作前深思熟虑候选行动，有效提升了任务完成的性能和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在大语言模型中的应用面临训练不稳定及模型行为漂移的问题。

Method: RLEP采用先收集验证的轨迹，然后在后续训练中回放这些轨迹，通过将新生成的轨迹与回放的高质量示例混合优化策略。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B基模型上，RLEP以更少的更新次数达到并超越基线，提升了AIME-2024、AIME-2025和AMC-2023任务的准确率。

Conclusion: RLEP通过减少无效探索并引导模型关注于更有希望的推理路径，提高了收敛速度与最终性能，为大语言模型训练提供了更高效的方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

TL;DR: 该论文提出"机器胡说八道"作为框架，分析大语言模型（LLM）的真实性衰减，并设计指标和测试数据集进行评估，发现某些训练策略和推理方式会加剧问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过引入“机器胡说八道”概念，帮助深入研究LLM真实性减弱现象及其根本机制。

Method: 提出了一个名为Bullshit Index的指标，用于量化模型对真实性的漠视，并引入分类法从四种角度分析“胡说”：空洞修辞、模棱两可、推诿词汇和未经验证的言论。同时设计并使用BullshitEval数据集进行实验评估。

Result: 实验证明，通过强化学习与人类反馈（RLHF）进行微调会显著加剧“胡说”现象；推理阶段的链式思维（CoT）提示对某些“胡说”形式有放大效果。此外，政治情境中“胡说”现象尤为普遍，推诿词汇是最常见的策略。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前AI系统在真实性与对齐性方面存在系统性挑战，需进一步探索改进措施以减少“胡说”行为并增强真实可信表现。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在后训练阶段利用规划结构提升小型开源LLMs的能力。

Method: 提出一种统一的后训练框架，包括从大规模LLM中蒸馏生成规划任务分解轨迹，以及通过监督学习和强化学习让小型模型模拟这些规划过程。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准上平均性能提升约7%；在OlympiadBench和AIME 2024数据集的泛化能力分别提升约10%和12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING有效提升小型开源LLMs在复杂推理任务中的表现，特别是在任务特定性能及泛化能力上。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种名为TeaR的新方法，通过精细的数据整理和强化学习来提高LLM在代码相关任务中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLM在推理能力方面存在局限性，尤其是在需要逐步执行代码的情况下可能过度依赖复杂的数据结构，而无法抓住核心的推理能力。

Method: 使用TeaR方法，通过精细的数据整理和强化学习，指导模型学习最佳的推理路径，并优化其在代码相关任务中的表现，同时提升通用推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，TeaR方法在17个基准测试中表现出显著改进，其中包括数学、知识、代码和逻辑推理领域的测试。在Qwen2.5-7B上提高了35.9%，在R1-Distilled-7B上提高了5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR证明通过优化数据整理与强化学习，可以有效提升LLM的推理能力，并有潜力成为未来LLM推理任务的重要方法。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Result: 实验结果显示，PubMedBERT针对NER任务的F1得分为82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中的F1得分达到66.10%，均优于通用科学模型如BlueBERT。

Conclusion: 领域特定的BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取上表现与一致性优于一般科学模型，具备推广到自动化文献分析的潜力。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

TL;DR: 本文分析LLMs的推理计算复杂性，表明其在高复杂性任务中存在能力局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在自主或半自主任务以及复杂性任务中的性能极限，从而理解这些模型的能力上限及可能的局限性。

Method: 从计算复杂性视角分析LLMs推理能力，研究其在执行与验证高复杂性任务方面的局限，并通过例子佐证。

Result: 论证了LLMs无法执行或验证超出一定复杂度的任务能力，并讨论了相应的影响。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能胜任多种任务，但在面临计算复杂任务及验证高复杂性任务时，其能力受到限制，这对潜在应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用真实数据和专家知识微调语言模型的方法，生成并修正心理咨询对话，构建了包含68K对话的中文心理支持语料库（CPsDD），并展示了综合对话支持系统（CADSS）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心理支持需求增加，但相关数据集，尤其是非英语语言数据的匮乏严重限制了研究发展。

Method: 提出了框架，通过微调两种大语言模型（对话生成器和对话修改器），生成心理咨询对话。此后利用自动和人工评审构建了CPsDD数据集，并引入了一个综合对话支持系统（CADSS）。

Result: CADSS在战略预测和情感支持对话任务上表现优异，同时在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上都达到了行业最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了非英语心理支持对话数据不足的问题，同时证明了在心理支持对话任务中，拟构对话和综合支持系统的有效性。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统研究中对双人对话的局限，旨在扩展VAP至多方参与的对话场景，以改善多方发言预测和语音交互。

Method: 利用含有多主题内容的日本三人对话数据集，训练多种VAP模型，基于语音数据预测未来活动。

Result: 在三人对话数据集上训练的模型性能优于基线模型，但对话类型对预测准确性有一定影响。

Conclusion: 首次证明了VAP在三人对话场景中的潜力，为将其应用于语音对话系统打下基础。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在多语言主观性检测中的优势，特别是在数据嘈杂或质量较低的情况下。

Method: 使用大型语言模型与精心设计的提示进行少量示例学习，并尝试了高级提示工程和样本选择策略以提高效果。

Result: 在CheckThat! 2025多语言主观性检测任务中的多个语言排名靠前，包括阿拉伯语和波兰语第一名，以及其他语言的前四名。

Conclusion: LLMs结合少量示例学习在多语言情感任务中具有很强的有效性和适应性，是传统微调方法的有力替代方案，尤其在标注数据稀缺或不一致时表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Conclusion: 增强跨语言检索性能具有广阔的改进潜力，这对实际的跨语言生成应用尤其重要。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型中长链式CoT监督微调与强化学习结合后，是否能够协同提升推理能力。

Method: 通过系统性实验，比较分析长链式CoT监督微调和强化学习在不同多模态推理基准测试中的效能与相互作用。

Result: SFT在困难问题中表现出色，但可能导致回答冗长及简单问题表现下降；RL提高了简洁性和整体表现，但对困难问题的增益较小；两者结合未能展现相加的优点，反而出现了准确性和风格等方面的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 结合这些后期训练技术需要更无缝和自适应的方法，以充分释放推理视觉语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 文档图像翻译任务面临因训练数据有限、视觉与文本信息复杂交互而导致的泛化挑战。

Method: 提出M4Doc框架，将仅图像编码器与预训练的大型多模态表示对齐，结合多模态知识训练轻量化翻译模型，并在推理阶段避免使用MLLM以提高效率。

Result: 实验显示，在交叉领域泛化和复杂文档图像场景翻译质量上有显著提升。

Conclusion: M4Doc证明了利用多模态方法解决文档图像翻译泛化问题的有效性，同时兼顾了推理效率。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Motivation: 通过揭示离散扩散语言模型的贝叶斯特性，提升推理效率及准确性，同时为推理提供不依赖额外训练的后验估计机制。

Method: 提出了一个基于蒙特卡罗边缘化的轻量推理时集成方法，通过K次掩码-去噪操作的平均值获得后验感知的标记概率及不确定性估计。该方法无需额外训练，同时提供一致性证明及有限样本误差界。

Result: 在WikiText-2的测试中，当K=8时，该方法以相当的模型规模实现了8.8的困惑度（明显优于GPT-2 Small的20.3）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的推理方法在无需额外训练的情况下，通过简单的推理时集成显著改善了离散扩散语言模型的性能。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: 应对LLMs在实际应用中因计算需求过高而难以部署的问题，研究如何通过知识蒸馏在有限资源约束下保留QA任务的性能。

Method: 使用Pythia和Qwen2.5模型，通过知识蒸馏压缩LLMs，并在SQuAD和MLQA基准测试上进行零样本和单样本提示条件下的实验评估。

Result: 学生模型参数量减少57.1%，但保留了超过90%的教师模型性能；单样本提示比零样本提示带来进一步性能提升。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合最少提示可在资源受限情况下提供高效且性能强大的压缩QA系统，并平衡了模型效率与任务表现之间的权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Conclusion: 无需大规模微调即可通过改进提示和少量强化学习微调实现高效且性能优异的复杂问答系统。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Method: 构建了一个四分类的语音伪装替换分类法，并收集含有500条自然生成的隐蔽言论的数据集。此外，针对现有模型性能进行了基准测试，并提出基于拼音提示的新策略，提升检测能力。

Result: 基准测试中，最优模型F1分数仅为0.672，且零样本推理策略表现更差。改进后的拼音提示策略显著提高了检测准确性。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了全面的汉语语音伪装替换分类法，以及一个更具挑战性且现实的检测基准，同时改进的拼音提示策略为抵御隐蔽内容提供了一条有效解决路径。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估摘要质量往往依赖于人力或只关注单一方面（如长度或语义），需开发综合自动化指标。

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入衡量语义相似性，以语义保留和摘要长度压缩的结合为依据，设计自动化评估工具。

Result: 实验结果显示，NOIR能够有效捕捉摘要器在长度与语义保留的权衡表现，并与人类的质量感知相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为评估和改进各种摘要任务提供了一种高效、全面的自动化工具，替代了依赖人力的传统方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Motivation: 注意力机制是Transformer架构的核心组件，作者观察到在注意力头和每个头的隐藏大小适当的情况下，增加注意力头的数量可以提升性能。因此，希望在参数开销较低的情况下，利用以上洞察来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种Simulated Attention Score（SAS），通过将低维的注意力头表示投射到高维空间，从而提升注意力容量。此外，还将这种模拟方法扩展到关键和查询嵌入的特征维度，并引入了参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）方案以控制参数开销。

Result: 在多种数据集和任务上进行了实验，验证了SAS方法的有效性，并显示出相比其他注意力变体的显著改进。

Conclusion: SAS方法能够在保持较小模型规模的情况下，模拟更大规模模型的行为，显著提升了模型的性能。同时，PEAA策略有效控制了参数开销。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Conclusion: 论文证明了K2RAG在回答准确性、效率及可扩展性上的显著提升，为LLM知识扩展提供了一种更优方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本嵌入的隐私风险，并复现和扩展了Vec2Text方法，发现其在理想条件下能从嵌入中重建原始文本，对文本嵌入的使用提出了警示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了验证Vec2Text方法的效果以及探讨文本嵌入的隐私风险，尤其是其在高维嵌入空间中意外成功的原因。

Method: 作者复现了Vec2Text方法的实验，增加了参数敏感性分析、重建敏感信息（如密码）的能力测试，以及探讨嵌入量化作为隐私防御机制的效果。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效重建文本，包括类似密码的高敏感性内容，但其对输入序列长度非常敏感。同时，加入高斯噪声及量化技术可以降低其隐私风险。

Conclusion: 文本嵌入具有潜在隐私风险，需慎重使用。论文提醒了进一步研究鲁棒防御机制的重要性，量化技术提供了简单有效的隐私增强方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种选择性对齐策略，优化大语言模型在训练后的对齐表现，通过对高影响力的Token优先处理，提高效率和对准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练后对齐（Post-training Alignment）是大语言模型中的关键挑战，文章旨在解决并优化不同Token对模型表现不均等贡献的问题。

Method: 研究中提出了“选择性对齐策略”，利用Token级别的对数概率差，在偏好对之间优先处理高影响力的Token，同时引入参考模型对选中的Token进行质量评估并优化。

Result: 实验表明，Selective-DPO方法在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: Token级别的优化及参考模型选择在改进偏好对齐方面至关重要。本研究为大语言模型对齐能力提升奠定理论基础。代码可访问：https://github.com/Dongzhijin/SDPO。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的流式语音翻译方法（StreamST）称为StreamUni，利用统一的大型语音-语言模型，完整地解决了语音分段、策略决策和翻译生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流式语音翻译方法依赖于句子级的语音片段以及辅助模型来完成翻译决策，这种方式受限于上下文信息不足，且由于语音输入和跨语种生成的复杂性，导致策略学习困难。

Method: 提出StreamUni模型，该模型通过引入语音版的链式思维（speech Chain-of-Thought, CoT），实现多阶段输出，从而完成语音分段、策略决策和翻译生成。此外，还提出了一种流式CoT训练方法，利用有限的CoT数据提升低延迟策略决策和生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一的模型架构和创新的CoT方法，克服了传统流式语音翻译方法的局限性，展示了在低延迟和高翻译质量间的良好平衡。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于Transformer的解码器模型来逆转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，有效地实现了复杂公式的简化和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者希望能在学习算法中有效整合符号知识，通过语义上合理的嵌入，直接在公式语义空间进行连续优化，并提出解决嵌入公式不可逆问题的方案。

Method: 通过构建针对STL语法的小型词汇表，训练基于Transformer的解码器模型，以实现信号时序逻辑公式的嵌入到公式转换，并在模型训练中综合评估不同公式复杂性的影响。

Result: 模型仅需一个epoch即可生成有效公式，10个epoch后便可掌握语义逻辑，同时操控解码公式的简化程度，生成语义上相近的公式。

Conclusion: 实验验证了模型在捕捉嵌入语义信息和跨分布泛化方面的高效性。最终应用于需求挖掘任务，直接在语义空间优化，表现优异。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的指令微调方法多采用传统自回归目标，但其对提示和响应的区分加权效果未被深入研究。

Method: 通过差异化地加权指令提示和响应token的损失，提出WIT方法并验证其在不同模型、数据集和基准测试中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，适当权重分配能显著提升模型性能和对输入提示变化的鲁棒性，还可作为后续训练的良好起点。

Conclusion: 传统指令微调损失函数可能不是最优，需要调整权重分配以得到更稳健和通用的模型实现。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Method: 固定源语言分词器，学习目标语言分词器，最大化跨语言语义对齐，并分别评估其内在属性及在机器翻译和语言建模中的表现。

Result: 尽管条件分词器与标准分词器表现出相似的统计属性，但在机器翻译质量上未见提升，仅在语言建模中实现了困惑度的改善。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际跨语言分词中面临数据效率瓶颈，需探索替代的参数化方案。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Method: 研究了核心指代解析对检索相关性、上下文理解以及总体生成质量的影响，并通过实验比较不同的检索池化策略和问答性能。

Result: 发现核心指代解析可以显著提高检索效果和问答性能；其中，平均池化策略在加核心指代解析后表现最佳，小模型从解析中获益更大。

Conclusion: 提出核心指代复杂性对RAG系统构成挑战，核心指代解析是一种有效的提升检索和生成性能的手段，为改进知识密集型AI应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Conclusion: 游戏论推理可以在AI理论与实际应用中通过变换不动点自然生成，这一框架具有实用价值，可用于AI语义对齐，引领语义嵌入新模式。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式健康代理在多轮推理、症状澄清和透明决策上存在不足，无法满足临床诊断中对结构化对话和适应性推理的要求。

Method: 提出了DocCHA框架，将诊断过程分为症状引出、病史获取、因果图构建三个阶段，并通过可解释的置信评分引导适应性询问和决策。

Result: DocCHA在两个真实的中文咨询数据集（IMCS21, DX）上表现优异，诊断准确性提高了5.18个百分点，症状回忆提高了30%以上，同时对话轮次仅有温和增长。

Conclusion: DocCHA框架通过模块化、信任可解释的结构化推理，显著增强了诊断会话的效率和透明度，有望在多语言和资源受限环境中实现值得信赖的临床助手。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 自动化框架为计算结构生物学中的模拟流程自动化提供了一个可扩展的稳健平台，为未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型在工业异常检测和推理中难以提供可解释的分析和泛化到未见类别，因此需要一个更适应特定领域的新方法。

Method: 提出了一个名为SAGE的框架，其中包括两个核心模块：自我指导事实增强（SFE）整合领域知识以提升视觉推理能力；熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO）用于对齐模型输出和专家偏好。此外，提供了一个名为AD-PL的定制数据集和一个量化评估框架（MLE）。

Result: SAGE框架在零样本和单样本场景下的工业异常数据集上表现优异，并显著提升了模型的逻辑性和一致性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过整合自我指导和偏好优化方法，为工业异常检测和推理提供了一种新的解决方案，具有较高的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

*Yu Wang,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MIRIX，一个模块化的多智能体记忆系统，突破了AI记忆的现有限制，并在多模态和单模态场景中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI记忆系统缺乏真实的个性化和长期记忆能力，无法满足实际场景需求，需设计新的记忆框架支持更丰富的用户信息管理。

Method: 设计了包含核心记忆、情节记忆、语义记忆、程序记忆、资源记忆和知识库六种记忆类型的模块化系统，使用多智能体框架动态调整更新和检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA和LOCOMO基准测试中，MIRIX分别超越现有系统35%和85.4%，并显著减少存储需求。

Conclusion: MIRIX树立了记忆增强语言模型的新性能标准，并通过应用程序实现了个性化记忆的实际应用。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）和显式奖励模型（EX-RM）之间的泛化能力差异，其主要结论是IM-RM更依赖于表面词级线索，表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了理解语言模型中的隐式和显式奖励模型在泛化性能上的差异及其根本原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验比较，研究IM-RM和EX-RM在不同数据分布下的表现，并验证各种关于泛化差异的假设。

Result: 研究发现，IM-RM更依赖于语言模型中表面的词级线索，这导致其泛化能力较差，且在词级分布变化时表现尤为明显。而针对可能的替代假设，研究也提供了相反证据。

Conclusion: 尽管IM-RM和EX-RM在数据、损失函数及模型上基本一致，但设计上的微小差异可以显著影响奖励模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Motivation: 探讨如何通过语言模型支持风湿病学等复杂医疗领域的临床决策，同时优化能源与成本效率。

Method: 运用小型语言模型（SLMs）结合检索增强生成（RAG）进行诊断与治疗性能评估，并与大型语言模型（LLMs）比较。

Result: SLMs结合RAG显示出更高的诊断和治疗性能，同时能源需求更低且支持成本高效的本地部署。

Conclusion: SLMs结合RAG在资源有限的医疗环境中具有吸引力，但需专业人员监督，因未达到专业医师的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对LLMs医学推理能力的评估方法存在缺陷，缺乏可扩展性和严谨性，因此需要一个新的评估工具来确保透明和可信的推理，促进其在医学决策中的应用。

Method: 提出并构建了MedThink-Bench基准，包含500个跨越10个医学领域的问题及专家逐步推理注释。同时引入LLM-w-Ref框架，通过细化推理和LLM裁判机制进行高精度且可扩展的评估。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家评估表现出强正相关性，实验显示较小的模型（如MedGemma-27B）可胜过较大的专有模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为评估LLMs医学推理能力提供了一个基础工具，其框架和实验结果展示了推进LLMs在临床应用中安全部署的潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法局限于预定义工作流程和静态工具集，这限制了系统的灵活性和解释性。

Method: 提出PyVision框架，使多模态语言模型（MLLMs）能够自主生成、执行和优化Python工具，通过分类及基准测试分析其工具使用情况。

Result: PyVision显著提升了视觉推理性能（如GPT-4.1提高7.8%，Claude-4.0-Sonnet提高31.1%）。

Conclusion: 动态工具开发提升了模型的灵活性，使其具备动态发明工具的能力，从而推进了自主视觉推理的发展。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

*Alan Malek,Jiawei Ge,Nevena Lazic,Chi Jin,András György,Csaba Szepesvári*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但在一些对人类来说简单的推理任务上却表现不佳，尤其是在处理脱离分布的简单推理问题时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析为何最先进的LLMs在简单推理任务中表现不佳，并揭示其背后的系统性失败原因。

Method: 通过创建一套程序生成的简单推理任务以及引入简化的“unpuzzles”数据集，研究模型在这些任务上的表现模式与失败原因。

Result: 即使是具备推理能力的最新模型，在处理这些简单推理问题时，仍会因依赖统计捷径、中间步骤错误或长上下文处理困难等问题而失败。此外，在许多时候模型在设计上也表现出记忆原始复杂问题时对简化版本的失效。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在简单推理任务中的脱离分布泛化能力仍然有限，简化问题并不意味着性能提升，研究需要进一步改善模型的推理与泛化能力。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型(LLMs)的框架，用于化工自动化中的故障恢复规划与过程控制，在验证实验中比传统方法表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化工过程的复杂性增加以及员工短缺与故障场景的复杂性，需要新的自动化方法，结合符号推理与控制。

Method: 使用有限状态机(FSMs)作为可解释框架，基于LLM的规划代理设计恢复方案，仿真代理执行并验证过程，还有循环验证与优化策略。

Result: 在案例研究1中，GPT-4o等模型在180个不同规模FSM上均达到有效路径成功率100%；在案例研究2中，该框架在温控实验中表现接近传统PID控制，并揭示提示循环在处理非线性中的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过结构化反馈及模块化代理，LLMs可以同时进行高层级规划和低层次控制，为化工自动化提供了新的语言驱动方法。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Motivation: 解决数据集中某些艺术风格主导导致的偏见问题，尤其是AI系统在不平衡数据下对罕见分类准确性低的缺陷。

Method: 提出名为BOOST的偏见自适应采样方法，通过动态调整温度标度和采样概率来改进和均衡分类表现。此外提出Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC)指标评估模型的类偏降解水平。

Result: 实验验证了BOOST在KaoKore和PACS数据集上能降低类别偏见，同时保持高性能表现。

Conclusion: BOOST方法有效应对绘画分类中的AI偏见问题，既保留了模型的高效性能又增强了公平性，是减少艺术AI模型偏见的一个强健解决方案。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在动态游戏交互中表现出色，但在涉及规则约束的交易系统时常出现问题（如规则违反、物品虚假生成和计算错误），严重影响玩家体验，亟需找到可靠的解决方案。

Method: SIBP通过自动推断对话状态和上下文特定的规则遵从性，将交易过程分解为六种状态，利用统一的提示框架实现上下文感知的物品引用和基于占位符的价格计算。

Result: 在100次交易对话评估中，SIBP表现出超过97%的状态合规性、超过95%的引用准确性和99.7%的计算精准度，同时保持了良好的计算效率，并显著优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: SIBP方法为商业游戏中的可信NPC交互提供了一个实用的基础，填补了大型语言模型在规则遵从问题上的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode

Conclusion: 神经符号方法和问答树方法有助于检测供应链中的非法活动，且论文系统地分析了人工与机器分类的不同。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何防止大语言模型被滥用生成有害内容，聚焦于通过过滤机制解决对齐难题的可行性。

Method: 分析及证明输入提示和输出过滤在理论上的计算复杂性，提出基于加密假设的不可行性结论，并探索松弛缓解方法。

Result: 显示对抗性输入提示能规避所有有效的提示过滤机制，输出过滤在某些设定下也是计算难以实现的；同时，松弛方法也面临计算障碍。

Conclusion: 通过外部过滤无法实现LLM的安全对齐，表明一个对齐的AI系统其智能性与判断力是不可分的。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Motivation: 提升供应链运输响应性和经济效率是关键目标，然而运输策略设计存在风险和复杂性。

Method: 提出Sim-to-Dec框架，结合生成的模拟模块和历史-未来双感知决策模型，进行端到端优化以改进策略设计。

Result: 在三组实测数据上，Sim-to-Dec显著提升了及时送达率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec框架能够有效应对运输动态并融合历史与预测，提高运输策略的执行表现。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DrugMCTS的新框架，通过整合RAG、多代理协作和蒙特卡罗树搜索来增强大语言模型在药物重新开发中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在药物发现中应用潜力巨大，但因需要超出预训练知识的推理而受到限制，且传统的微调或检索增强生成存在效率或结构化数据利用不足的问题。

Method: DrugMCTS框架通过五个专门代理检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，并结合结构化推理、多代理协作以及反馈驱动的蒙特卡罗树搜索，无需领域专用微调即可应用。

Result: DrugMCTS在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上的召回率和鲁棒性显著超过通用大语言模型和深度学习基线。此外，DrugMCTS提升了Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的性能，相较Deepseek-R1提高了20%以上。

Conclusion: 本研究表明结构化推理、多代理协作及反馈驱动搜索机制对提升大语言模型在药物发现的应用价值至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估标准难以同时评价AI的生产活动与社交互动能力，因此提出StarDojo来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于《星露谷物语》设计了包含5大领域、1000个任务的基准，提供简化版本和用户友好界面，用于支持多线程环境，适用于评估多模态大语言模型。

Result: 实际评估表明，当前最先进的如GPT-4.1模型仅达成12.7%的成功率，暴露了其在视觉理解、多模态推理和低级操作上的明确局限性。

Conclusion: StarDojo作为友好的环境和基准为研究开发稳健和开放式智能代理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Method: 提出了AlgEval研究框架，通过分析隐藏表示、注意力模式和推理计算，揭示模型使用的算法原语和组合方式；采用自顶向下的假设形成和自底向上的电路级分析来验证方法。

Conclusion: AlgEval框架为理解LLMs的内部计算提供了系统方法，促进人类理解的可解释性，同时可能带来新的架构和训练方法的突破。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Method: 研究中开发了算法，用于分析基于规则的机器学习系统中的负面特性，包括负重叠和冗余问题。

Result: 结果表明，广泛应用的基于规则的学习工具通常会产生包含这些不良特性的规则集。

Conclusion: 基于规则的机器学习模型虽然具有广泛应用，但常伴随一些不良特性，需要进一步关注和提升其解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，传统的图神经网络聚合方法对链接预测的模型性能提升有限，亟需一种更有效的方法来处理相关问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种新颖的Context Pooling方法，首次将图池化应用到知识图谱中，并支持在归纳设置中生成查询特异性子图；并提出了两种指标（邻域精度和邻域召回）来评估邻居的逻辑相关性，从而筛选出与查询逻辑相关的邻居用于链接预测。

Result: 该方法通用于多种模型，并在三个公开的归纳和迁移数据集的42/48项设置下实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling在知识图谱链接预测任务中展现了优异的性能，并突出了其在生成查询特异性图方面的独特应用价值。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer

The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief

limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在回答空间布局问题时存在明显不足，PlanQA 希望通过设计针对几何和空间推理的综合测评基准，推动语言模型在这一领域的提升。

Method: 利用室内场景的结构化表示（如 JSON、XML 布局），通过设计多样化的问题类型（例如距离、可见性、最短路径等）来评估模型的几何、拓扑和设计约束推理能力。

Result: 测试结果表明，现有的开源与商业语言模型在完成浅层查询方面表现尚可，但在物理约束模拟、空间一致性维持以及应对布局扰动时表现较差。

Conclusion: PlanQA 揭示了当前语言模型在真实世界空间推理中的盲点，期望未来研究能够开发能够精确推理几何和空间属性的语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Method: 提出了一种基于双层优化的改进DPO框架，引入正则化手段来促进输出概率的绝对改进，并保持优化的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的方法在推理和总结基准上优于标准DPO，改善了推理准确性并提高了输出分布对偏好的对齐程度。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新见解，有助于实现更可靠和可解释的语言模型对齐。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小提琴的尺寸缩减影响了其几何特性，特别是等高线形状。然而，尽管专家可以观察到这些差异，但尚未进行定量研究。本研究的目的是填补这一知识空白，通过量化分析来判断小提琴是否经过尺寸缩减。

Method: 研究以25件通过摄影测量获取3D几何网格的小提琴为样本，提取每毫米等高线并进行参数化（曲线方程y = α*|x|^β），从中计算参数特性并构建数值特征。随后使用分类方法评估几何数据在检测尺寸缩减中的有效性。

Result: 研究表明，基于几何特性区分缩减和非缩减小提琴是可行的。在现有方法中，曲线参数beta表现出较强的预测性能，但对于某些较难量化转变的小提琴，区分仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 小提琴等高线研究可以提供一种方法识别尺寸缩减。这种几何分析方法不仅验证了分类的可能性，还揭示了哪些参数更具预测力，如beta的关键作用，为未来研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评测框架主要关注AI的技术能力或减少危害，而本研究希望评估AI是否能够全方位促进人类的幸福与发展，提供相应的理论与实践指导。

Method: FAI Benchmark从七个维度定义人类幸福，并通过1229个客观和主观问题进行评估。方法包括专用LLM评估器、跨维度评价，以及几何平均得分以保证平衡性。

Result: 对28个主流语言模型测试结果表明，最高分达到72/100，但在信仰与精神等维度上均无法达到满意的对齐效果，表明当前模型存在较大改进空间。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来开发能够促进人类幸福的AI系统提供了理论框架，对AI开发、伦理与评价具有重大的启发意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向的优化方式在性能与计算效率上实现显著提升，尤其适合端到端的自主驾驶任务。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一组算法，可以在多项式复杂度下调整精度和详尽程度以识别实际原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI和因果关系文献主要关注因素和结果之间的关系，但用户更期待了解实际的直接原因，这一问题尚未明确化且识别实际原因是NP完全问题，缺乏实用解决方案。

Method: 提出了一组算法，这些算法能以多项式复杂度，并通过调整计算时间在精度和详尽性之间权衡，用于识别非布尔、黑箱和随机系统的实际原因。

Result: 实验表明，算法可以识别当前方法未能处理的非布尔、黑箱和随机系统的原因，并且随着计算时间的增加可以提高精度和详尽性。

Conclusion: 新算法有效填补了现有方法的局限，为识别实际原因提供了一种高效且可调节的解决方案。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在法律争议分析中表现出法律知识不足、概念理解有限及推理能力不足的问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了模型在复杂法律案件中的表现，特别是在法律应用分析及司法决策逻辑理解方面。

Conclusion: 该方法为智能法律援助系统的实现提供了一种新颖的技术路径。

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去十年少数公司通过扩展计算能力导致AI模型性能的不平等。

Method: 通过固定分布下的目标函数建模，分析计算扩展的边际效益，以及从理论和实证角度研究性能差异的证据。

Result: 研究表明计算扩展的收益逐渐递减，领先公司也难以长期保持显著性能优势。

Conclusion: 未来政策和战略需要关注中低预算模型在AI能力上的日益接近。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的迅速普及，其对经济和工作的影响成为重要议题。本文旨在探索AI在工作活动中的作用及其对不同职业的影响。

Method: 分析20万条用户与Microsoft Bing Copilot的匿名对话数据，研究AI支持的工作活动类型、完成效果及其应用广度，并结合职业任务数据计算AI适用性分数。

Result: 结果显示，AI被广泛用于信息收集、写作等活动。知识工作占主导位置，如计算机科学、数学和行政支持相关职业。还发现销售类职业因信息沟通需求，也具有较高AI适用性分数。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在知识密集型和信息沟通相关职业中适用性较高，并且工资和教育水平与AI的适用性有一定关联，为探索职业AI影响提供了关键视角。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

### [171] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非传统的语言模型扩展方法，通过使用不可训练的固定输入嵌入，实现模块化组合和逐层进阶的训练理念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前语言模型的扩展主要依靠高成本的端到端训练，缺乏灵活性。本文旨在探讨更高效的构建性方法。

Method: 利用冻结的Unicode字形视觉结构嵌入，提出模块组合和逐层增长两种方法：通过模型输出的平均值完成模块融合；逐层堆叠和训练Transformer实现深度扩展。

Result: 新方法实现了模型的即插即用组合，加强了推理性能，并稳定实现深度模型复杂能力的提升。

Conclusion: 此方法打破了传统单体优化流程，提供了新的资源高效扩展方式，推动了AI开发的模块化和循环学习，同时促进了AI开发的普及化。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Conclusion: 神经网络在数据、模型规模和训练分布适当时可泛化组合任务，且任务组分的线性可解码性可用于评估模型的组合表现。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文探讨大规模语言模型（LLMs）及视觉语言模型（VLMs）注意力机制的能效问题，通过对八种注意力机制进行基准测试，发现优化的内核实现（如Flash Attention等）在能效方面表现最佳。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨大规模语言模型的注意力机制如何在保持性能的同时降低训练时的能耗和硬件资源需求。

Method: 通过GPT-2架构基准测试，评估八种注意力机制的训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用及能耗等多个关键指标。

Result: 优化的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention、MLA）能效表现最佳，且仅降低GPU功耗不足以保证能耗减少，训练时间同样重要。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了注意力机制设计中的能效基准评估的重要性，并为选择节能机制提供了实用性见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为autoeval-dmun的自动化工具，用于评估扩散模型中的非学习算法（MU）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MU在清除信息后难以验证信息是否完全移除、以及可能损害模型性能的问题。

Method: 设计了一个自动化工具autoeval-dmun，利用语言模型提取结构化的相关知识，识别未学习的概念，以及通过对抗提示避免概念移除。

Result: 工具可以有效评估现有扩散模型的非学习方法，发现语言模型能很好地表征非学习损害的语义相关性并通过对抗提示规避损害。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun 提供了一种高效评估MU效果的新方法，显著改进了对模型使用中的非学习操作的评估能力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP是一种用于图上的链接预测的新框架，通过结合GNN节点编码和最短路径上的序列建模，解决了传统GNN中忽视节点对间子图结构的问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN难以捕获链接预测中的特定结构模式，传统方法要么计算成本高，要么依赖简单的启发式方法，无法有效建模多跳依赖关系。

Method: SP4LP首先利用GNN计算节点表示，然后提取候选节点对之间的最短路径，并使用序列模型处理路径上的节点嵌入，结合了多跳结构信息和计算效率。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中表现出最先进的效果，并且理论上被证明比标准GNN和一些先进的结构特征方法更具表现力。

Conclusion: SP4LP建立了一种高效表达多跳关系模式的通用、原则性的链接预测方法，填补了现有GNN在结构信息建模方面的空白。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器提供了比现有方法更好的模块化架构构建可能，但在保持任务性能方面仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了图结构内嵌的结构常识，这对有效的表示学习至关重要。

Method: 通过使用一阶逻辑规则显式表示结构常识并结合图对比学习框架，同时引入拓扑和属性规则，对编码器进行表示对齐指导。

Result: 实验表明，Str-GCL优于现有图对比学习方法，在提升表示学习性能方面效果显著。

Conclusion: Str-GCL首次直接将结构常识引入到图对比学习中，为图表示学习提供了全新视角。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Conclusion: CCQ为极低位数量化的推理优化提供了新的思路，通过开源其模型和推理引擎，展示了其在实际应用中的显著潜力。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

TL;DR: 本文提出了G-Guard，一种基于图神经网络的输入分类器，用于抵御针对大语言模型的多轮越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型尽管经过精细训练以确保安全性，但仍容易受到越狱攻击。传统的单轮攻击已发展为更难检测和防御的多轮攻击，研究需要应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出创新性的G-Guard方法，该方法通过构建实体图捕捉多轮查询中有害关键词与查询的关系，并使用注意力增强机制从会话中检索出相似的单轮查询以辅助分类。

Result: 实验结果显示，G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效提升了在抵御多轮越狱攻击中的能力，为保障大语言模型的安全性提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，解决现有描述方法中的高变异性和低可靠性问题。

Method: 提出了Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul)方法，通过去除描述提取过程，将大语言模型的知识直接蒸馏到提示中，并采用多提示权重反映其重要性。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上表现优越，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 去描述、多提示的策略有效提高了模型的鲁棒性，并表明该方法在视觉语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了扩展流匹配的新方法，即“条件引导流匹配”(CGFM)，用于改进时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有扩散模型的局限，包括刚性源分布和有限采样路径，并利用预测误差信息改进性能。

Method: 提出CGFM方法，将辅助模型的输出作为条件引入流匹配，创建双向条件概率路径，并利用广义仿射路径扩大概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明CGFM能够稳定提升预测性能，超过现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM展现出在时间序列预测领域的显著潜力和先进效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Motivation: 强化学习过程中如何同时有效利用多个预训练模型的隐藏信息一直是尚未充分研究的问题。

Method: 设计了一种名为WSA的新架构，用于整合多个预训练模型的嵌入，以平衡效率与性能的权衡，并进行了多种整合方式的对比分析。

Conclusion: WSA提供了一种高效的方式整合预训练模型的嵌入，可用于改善强化学习中的状态表示并提高训练效率。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Result: 在仇恨言论检测中验证了DeCoLe的有效性，其在标签错误检测任务中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DeCoLe能够有效处理标签偏差问题，为组织数据管理提供了可靠的工具，提升数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Result: 实验结果表明，所学习的奇异子空间在特征分析和多步预测等任务中既可靠又有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法概念简单且可扩展，能够更好地学习随机动力系统中Koopman算子的主导奇异函数。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: 通过整合多种LLMs的多样化预测，可以更好地对不确定性进行估计，同时提升模型预测的可靠性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Conclusion: 揭示了分布式深度学习系统中的中间特征泄漏问题，提高其安全性设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Conclusion: 新方法为研究剂量和时间变化提供了有效工具，有助于医疗等关键领域的可操作性应用。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Result: 在模拟数据和实际应用中的测试结果表明，该方法可以可靠地检测置换特征重要性分数何时不可靠。

Conclusion: TRIP可以作为一种有效工具，用于评估置换特征重要性分数的可靠性，尤其在高维数据情况下表现出协调性。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用编码-近似-重构算子学习模型，实现了与离散化无关的多保真学习，展现了理论和实验上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 新的算子学习模型在理论和实验上均显示出对多保真学习的高效性，并通过离散化独立性改进了算子学习模型的稳健性和普适性。

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布环境中模型性能、隐私保护和通讯效率之间的平衡问题，对现有方法的不足如隐私保证、资源效率及量子优越性使用进行了改进。

Method: 设计了一个混合CNN-PQC架构用于去中心化学习，采用差分隐私精度加权聚合，不同层选择性同态加密，以及动态层级冻结以降低通讯开销。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效提升分簇联邦学习的训练性能，同时兼顾了通信效率和安全性。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)的框架，生成能逃避入侵检测系统（IDS）的隐蔽对抗性攻击，通过条件变分自动编码器(CVAE)，成功提高了对隐蔽性对抗攻击的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机（UAV）在民用空域中的使用增加，现有的异常检测方式难以应对新型威胁，因此需要更智能、更有弹性的入侵检测系统。

Method: 提出一种利用cGAN生成隐蔽对抗样本的框架，将已知攻击扰动为伪装为正常状态的对抗样本，并通过CVAE采用负对数似然方法区分对抗样本与真正的分布外样本。

Result: 实验表明，与传统基于马氏距离的检测方法相比，CVAE方法基于后悔值的检测评分在捕获隐蔽性对抗威胁方面表现显著提高。

Conclusion: 综合结果证实，高级概率建模对提升IDS在应对生成模型驱动的自适应网络攻击的防御能力具有重大意义。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法相比传统SAC算法能将收敛速度提升至3倍，信息泄露减少13%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效降低信息泄露风险并提高模型训练效率，为保护联邦学习中的隐私提供新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Method: 使用Magistral Small模型并通过LoRA微调，创建了包含分子性质和化学反应的双域数据集进行训练。

Result: 调整后的模型在格式一致性、生成分子的化学有效性及可行的合成路径方面表现明显优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明通用LLMs可以通过适配成为可靠的化学研究工具，但仍需解决立体化学错误和知识更新等问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Result: 使用该方法在四个节点分类基准上提升了准确率至多达3%。

Conclusion: 几何感知投影不仅增强了预测性能，还提高了图表表示的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Motivation: DRL虽然在多个领域取得了成功，但其在评价与训练环境参数不同的情况下表现有限。现有方法通常通过多个上下文训练或额外问题结构，但实际应用中获得多样数据困难。本文探索通过上下文相关参数的规律性来解决此问题。

Method: 提出了上下文增强型Bellman方程（CEBE），并证明该方法对多个上下文训练的Q值函数表现为一阶近似。然后推导出上下文样本增强（CSE），作为一种在确定性控制环境中高效的数据增强方法。

Result: 数值实验验证表明，CSE在模拟环境中可以显著提高深度强化学习的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析与实验验证，表明CEBE和CSE策略在单一上下文训练数据下也能提高泛化能力，为实用性面临高成本获取多样数据的场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了PU学习的理论框架，在无类先验约束下为样本复杂性提供指导。

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Result: GO-CBED在多种因果推理任务中超越了现有基线，尤其在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的环境下。

Conclusion: 目标导向与前瞻性设计的实验规划显著提高了因果实验的效率和针对性。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Result: 验证了TLC在Alanine Dipeptide体系中的两项增强取样任务中的有效性，与现有方法相比性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: TLC框架能够高效学习集体变量，在稀有事件取样和状态区分方面展示了实际价值。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GTED的评价框架，改进了自动化定理证明中的语义评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的自动化定理声明的评价方法面临语义理解不足、高计算成本和依赖现有证明技术等问题。

Method: GTED通过标准化形式化声明并将其转换为操作树，同时使用通用树编辑距离（GTED）指标计算语义相似度。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet基准测试中，GTED超越现有所有基线指标，取得最高的准确率和Kappa分数。

Conclusion: GTED为社区提供了一种更忠实的自动化评估度量工具，其代码和实验结果已经公开。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

*Pengfei Jiao,Jialong Ni,Di Jin,Xuan Guo,Huan Liu,Hongjiang Chen,Yanxian Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的多任务提示框架(HGMP)，以改进异构图神经网络的任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练和微调方法在异构图神经网络中存在与下游任务不匹配的问题，提示学习被提出以解决目标不一致性。

Method: 论文提出了HGMP，通过将所有任务格式统一为图级任务格式、设计图级对比预训练策略，以及引入异构特征提示来优化模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，HGMP在公共数据集上的性能显著优于基线方法，适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: HGMP有效弥合了预训练模型与下游任务的鸿沟，提升了对异构信息的利用能力和多任务性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络是如何通过训练数据结构隐式形成复杂模型，并在推断过程中捕获关于未来的概率分布。

Method: 通过分析变压器和循环神经网络对下一步预测任务的表现，研究其隐式生成的空间结构及其与输入序列的关系。

Result: 发现深度神经网络的几何关系独立于其架构设计，能够通过观察上下文自然发现低维模型，对输入序列的影响以概率密度的方式表现。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络具备强大的内在表示能力，无需显式编程即可捕捉复杂的几何和概率性联系。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前化学科学面临小型、多样化和模糊数据集的挑战，传统机器学习方法难以完全利用，而通用模型（例如大语言模型）有可能解决这些问题。

Method: 论文对GPMs的基本构建原则进行了探讨，并综述了这些模型在化学科学内的最新应用，涵盖整个科研流程。

Conclusion: 尽管这些应用大多仍处于初期阶段，但随着对GPMs的兴趣增加，许多应用将在未来几年内逐步成熟并对化学科学产生显著影响。

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对多任务学习（MTL）的框架DTME-MTL，通过动态调整token解决梯度冲突问题，改善任务之间的负迁移并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL框架中的不同任务目标可能出现矛盾，导致负迁移且当前Transformer网络无法灵活适配，因而需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种名为Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL)的框架，通过在token空间内识别梯度冲突并动态解决冲突，避免了直接复制网络参数，从而减小了参数增加的问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，DTME-MTL显著提升了多任务性能，同时减少了计算开销，更适用于基于Transformer的MTL架构。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为多任务学习提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，改进了任务间的兼容性和适应性。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高脑机接口（BCI）分类器的分类精度和置信度评估能力，以更准确地区分易与难样本，从而提升系统整体性能。

Method: 对比分析传统方法（CSP-LDA、MDRM）与深度学习方法（深度集成、直接不确定性量化和标准CNN），并提出利用温度缩放（MDRM-T）改进结果。

Result: 发现传统方法（CSP-LDA和MDRM-T）在不确定性量化方面表现最佳，而深度学习方法（深度集成和CNNs）在分类性能上更具优势。所有模型均能在一定程度上区分易与难的样本。

Conclusion: CSP-LDA和MDRM-T适用于生成最佳不确定性估计，而深度学习方法更适合高效分类。通过拒绝模糊样本，可显著提高BCI的准确率。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

*Berkant Turan,Suhrab Asadulla,David Steinmann,Wolfgang Stammer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为神经概念验证器（Neural Concept Verifier, NCV）的框架，通过结合Prover-Verifier Games（PVGs）和概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）实现高维数据的可解释非线性分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Prover-Verifier Games（PVGs）在非线性分类模型上的可验证性方面具有潜力，但目前尚未应用于高维度图像等复杂输入。同时，概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）可有效地将数据翻译为可解释的概念，但其受制于低容量的线性预测器。

Method: 引入NCV框架，通过最新的最小监督概念发现模型从原始输入中提取结构化概念编码，Prover选择编码子集后，Verifier使用非线性预测器基于这些编码进行决策。

Result: 在高维、逻辑复杂的数据集上，NCV表现优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器基线，同时有助于缓解捷径行为问题。

Conclusion: NCV框架展示了在实现高性能和可验证人工智能方面的潜力。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

TL;DR: DAD是一种面向多变量时间序列的实时异常检测方法，利用在线去相关学习实现高效检测，在性能和计算效率间实现优化平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于(工业)物联网的增长，导致实时异常检测需求增加，包括处理高维流数据和单次数据通过，而无需存储历史数据。

Method: 提出DAD方法，基于单次通过的在线去相关学习方式，按样本学习并监测数据的相关性结构，同时提供实际的超参数调优策略。

Result: 通过实验，在主流基准数据集上，DAD实现了对各种异常类型的优越和一致性性能，且在高维数据流情况下表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAD为实时、内存受限的异常检测树立了新的基准，兼具检测效率与计算效率，适用于高维数据场景。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了低秩近似中的数值问题，提供了一种稳定且高效的框架，对于压缩与微调现代大规模神经网络具有显著意义。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Motivation: 传统的切换方式在面对复杂的移动网络场景中效率低下，为了解决延迟与失败问题，3GPP引入了条件切换（CHO），但CHO也面临着新的挑战，如资源分配和信号管理。

Method: 提出了一种与O-RAN范式对齐，并利用元学习策略优化CHO的框架，旨在优化切换效率并减少延迟。

Result: 在波动的信号条件下，该框架性能比3GPP基准提升至少180%。

Conclusion: 基于该框架的CHO优化方案能够显著降低信号波动带来的切换失败风险，提高网络连接的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Conclusion: 此方法可帮助自动区分职业定义，为职业转换提供了新的路径和可能性。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过创新的因果建模和干预机制，有效提升了无监督图领域自适应的表现。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为TransformEEG的混合型卷积-Transformer模型，针对使用脑电图（EEG）数据进行帕金森病（PD）检测，并在多个公开数据集上的测试表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在EEG信号的分析中存在泛化能力较差的问题，主要由被试之间的高度异质性引起，因此需要开发更适合处理EEG数据的新模型架构。

Method: TransformEEG结合了卷积神经网络和Transformer架构，采用一种深度卷积分词器聚焦于信道特异性特征，能更高效地在Transformer编码器的自注意力层内混合特征。通过四个公开数据集（290名被试）进行了嵌套Leave-N-Subjects-Out交叉验证，结果与其他七种模型进行了比较。

Result: TransformEEG实现了所有测试分组中平衡准确率中位数（78.45%）和最小四分位距（6.37%），结合数据增强和阈值修正后准确率中位数提升至80.10%、四分位距降至5.74%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在使用EEG数据进行帕金森病检测时表现出更一致和更不偏斜的结果，比其他研究模型显示了显著降低的可变性及更可靠的检测性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合联邦切分学习（Federated Split Learning, FSL）和Hyperledger Fabric（HLF）的去中心化架构，实现安全高效的协同机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL和SL方法在中心化和可扩展性方面存在局限性，而本研究旨在开发一种既能保护隐私又能大规模部署的架构。

Method: 结合FSL和HLF，利用链码管理模型执行和点对点聚合，同时通过HLF的瞬态字段和PDCs确保数据隐私性，无需中心协调器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL在准确性上与集中式FSL表现相当，并与基于以太坊的方法相比显著减少了每轮训练时间。还展示了较低的区块链开销以及较高的性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HLF-FSL结合了去中心化和隐私保护特性，为企业级敏感领域的协同学习提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

<details>

Motivation: 探究有限宽度神经网络中深度对输入特征空间变化的层次影响，填补相关理论理解的空白。

Method: 通过分析固定批次输入和随机高斯权重下隐藏激活矩阵秩的数学表达式，推导出基于深度的秩衰减模式及其局部最大值的闭式表达。

Result: 主要发现了 ReLU 网络中激活矩阵秩的几何衰减规律、其局部最大值随深度的振荡行为，以及宽度和初始化模式如何影响秩行为。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了随机 ReLU 网络如何交替折叠和重新恢复输入特征子空间，深化了对深度网络表达能力的理解。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FedCBDR方法，旨在通过全局协调和重新加权学习目标，在联邦类增量学习（FCIL）中解决类不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦类增量学习中因缺乏全局视角导致回放数据的类不平衡问题，同时难以应对新旧任务分类的不均衡性。

Method: FedCBDR包括两部分：1）全球视角数据回放模块，结合隐私保护的全局表示和基于类感知与重要性敏感的采样策略实现平衡回放；2）任务感知温度缩放模块，根据任务动态调整logits的温度，降低对多数类的过度置信增强对少数类的敏感性。

Result: 实验证明，FedCBDR在异构数据分布下实现了类平衡采样，并改进了从早期到近期任务的不均衡条件下的泛化能力，比六种最新方法提升了2%-15%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FedCBDR不仅能在隐私保护的框架下解决类不平衡问题，还能显著提升FCIL的性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）因“越狱攻击”暴露出的安全漏洞，并提出GuardVal协议对这些问题展开评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有LLM漏洞评估方法不足的问题，特别是在面对不断演化的LLM和需求复杂的“越狱”攻击时。

Method: 提出GuardVal评估协议，可动态生成和优化攻击提示，基于防御模型的状态调整评估方法，同时引入防止提示优化过程停滞的新优化方法。

Result: 对包括Mistral-7b和GPT-4在内的多种模型进行了测试，覆盖了10个安全域，揭示了不同模型间的行为模式及其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLM行为的理解，为未来更加安全的模型开发提供了指导，并为LLM漏洞评估设定了新的标准。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

TL;DR: 本研究提出多任务神经网络以估计随机实验中的分布式处理效应（DTE），并证实其在各种数据集上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统利用平均处理效应（ATE）的方法难以提供实验结果的详细信息，而现有回归方法在估计DTE时面临精度和计算效率的挑战。

Method: 采用多任务神经网络，通过引入单调形状约束和多阈值标签学习，提高条件结果分布估计的准确性。

Result: 在模拟数据和真实数据实验中，该方法均展现了优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代因果推断应用提供了详细理解处理效应异质性的有效解决方案，具有广阔的实际应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了机器遗忘的深度遗忘问题，提出了一种名为OPC的算法来克服现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器遗忘方法仅进行浅层遗忘，未能彻底移除被遗忘数据在模型中的影响，因此需要一种更深度的遗忘机制。

Method: 作者定义了一个基于特征表示单点收缩的深度遗忘理论标准，提出了一个高效的近似算法，并以此构造了一个通用的机器遗忘新算法OPC。

Result: 实验结果表明，OPC在图像分类遗忘基准测试中表现出色，不仅有效进行了深度遗忘，还表现出对性能恢复攻击和梯度反演攻击的强抗性。

Conclusion: OPC通过其理论基础实现了深度特征的遗忘，证明了机器遗忘方法在稳健性方面需进一步增强。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出TRIX框架，在对抗训练中根据类别特性动态调整对抗攻击强度，提升分类任务中的公平性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法无法考虑类别间脆弱性差异，导致强类别鲁棒性增强而弱类别更易受攻击，产生对抗不公平性。

Method: TRIX框架依据类别特点，针对强类别使用目标性更弱的对抗攻击以增强多样性，对弱类别使用非目标性更强的对抗攻击以提高鲁棒性，结合类别权重调整与扰动优化。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，TRIX显著提高了最弱类别的准确率，降低了类别间鲁棒性差距，并保持整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX通过动态对抗训练机制，平衡了类别之间的鲁棒性差异，是一种公平有效的对抗防御方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Result: 实验结果表明，S4T在多个常规多任务基准上优于现有TTT方法，这验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: S4T方法为多任务TTT问题提供了新的解决途径，提升了模型在分布偏移情境下的表现，为现实应用中的通用性打下基础。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过整合建模与实验设计中的思想，这种正则化方法改善了状态空间中的数据分布，有助于提升模型的可解释性、鲁棒性及训练效率。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Result: 相比现有方法，更准确地揭示了Lipschitz常数与注意力分布的依赖关系；验证了JaSMin正则化能增强模型鲁棒性并降低整体网络的局部Lipschitz常数。

Conclusion: 改进的界限和JaSMin技术提供了更优的理论解释和实际性能，有助于深化transformers模块的鲁棒性研究。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Result: 开发了新的风险界，改进了协方差算子估计和动态系统中的算子学习准确性，并通过数值实验验证其实用性。

Conclusion: 数据相关性可以通过新方法有效处理，Bernstein不等式为非i.i.d数据的学习问题带来了新可能性和实践价值。

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

*Giovanni Dispoto,Paolo Bonetti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新算法，在保留复杂专家行为特点的同时提取可解释的策略，并通过经典控制环境和金融交易场景验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度强化学习技术在解决复杂游戏和实际问题中表现出色，但缺乏解释性是瓶颈。在实际应用中，解释性的缺乏可能造成问题，因此需要开发具有理论保障且更具解释性的算法。

Method: 利用优势函数衡量动作间优劣，提出一种基于已有经验数据训练的可解释策略算法，可以在不损失专家行为特性的情况下生成线性政策。

Result: 新算法在经典控制环境和金融交易场景中表现良好，能够有效提取复杂专家策略中的有意义信息。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种兼顾解释性与性能的新路径，尤其适用于需要政策透明性的任务环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了一个有上下文的顺序决策问题，其中某些协变量缺失，但可以通过预训练的AI模型进行插补，并分析了该模型对决策过程中遗憾的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在具有缺失协变量的上下文决策问题中，如何利用预训练AI模型改善决策效果，以及分析模型插补对遗憾的作用机制。

Method: 提出了"模型弹性"的概念，量化协变量真实值与插补值间差异对奖励函数的敏感性；在"随机缺失"情境下，利用正交统计学习和双重鲁棒回归对预训练模型进行校准。

Result: 在校准后，插补协变量的质量显著提升，从而大幅改善了遗憾的理论界限。

Conclusion: 结果表明，准确的预训练模型在顺序决策问题中具有实际价值，而"模型弹性"是理解和改进预训练模型应用的关键指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于平方根参数化的方法，解决了变分推断中自然梯度收敛性难以理论证明的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分推断使用自然梯度下降在实践中收敛快速，但其理论上的收敛性保证较难建立，特别是在涉及凹对数似然和高斯近似的简单情况下。

Method: 提出利用高斯协方差的平方根参数化来处理，证明了自然梯度变分高斯推断的理论收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，自然梯度方法相比欧几里得或Wasserstein几何的算法具有优势。

Conclusion: 平方根参数化方法为自然梯度变分推断提供了新型理论收敛性保障，有益于提升算法性能。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小企业是现代经济的核心，但由于数据稀缺，特别是在线放贷者缺乏直接信用记录，传统的信用风险分析方法难以有效应用。因此，需要一种新的方法来解决中小企业信贷风险评估问题。

Method: 论文提出了利用图神经网络（GNN）进行中小企业相互作用的建模，该方法通过解析交易和社交数据中的空间依赖关系，以预测企业的贷款违约风险。

Result: 基于真实数据集（23.4M用于供应链分析，8.6M用于违约预测），提出的GNN方法超过传统方法和现有基线，供应链挖掘和违约预测的AUC分别达到0.995和0.701。此外，该方法还能帮助监管方预测供应链中断对银行的冲击，特别是在物资短缺和压力测试中提供更准确的风险评估。

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,
yet their credit risk analysis often struggles with scarce data, especially for
online lenders lacking direct credit records. This paper introduces a Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based framework, leveraging SME interactions from
transaction and social data to map spatial dependencies and predict loan
default risks. Tests on real-world datasets from Discover and Ant Credit (23.4M
nodes for supply chain analysis, 8.6M for default prediction) show the GNN
surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve
stress testers key data for CCAR risk buffers. This approach provides a
scalable, effective tool for assessing SME credit risk.

TL;DR: 本文探讨直接偏好优化（DPO）如何作为机器学习中从偏好学习的两大理论联系的特定形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DPO的运作原理至关重要，因为它在模型的应用领域中应用广泛，同时目前DPO领域研究势头正旺。

Method: 研究将Savage损失函数与Doignon-Falmagne和Machina的随机选择理论相结合，支持选择放弃和非凸目标设置，并扩展DPO场景。

Result: 为DPO提供了一个广义框架，涵盖了其当前部分变体的应用，从而理解其局限性并探索解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为DPO提供了理论理解框架，并拓展了DPO的研究方向和实践用法。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

TL;DR: ApexOracle是一个结合了AI技术的工具，可快速预测抗菌化合物的效力，并设计针对新病原体的分子，应对抗菌药耐药性危机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抗菌药物研发跟不上抗菌药物耐药性的快速发展，亟需创新型方法发现有效的抗生素。

Method: 提出了ApexOracle，一个结合分子特征、基因组和文献派生信息，通过离散扩散语言模型和双嵌入框架的AI系统，能够预测化合物效力并生成新分子。

Result: ApexOracle在多种细菌种类和化学模式下超越了现有方法，并可以有效迁移至缺乏抗菌数据的新病原体。

Conclusion: ApexOracle提供了一种可扩展的策略，能快速预测并设计高效的新分子，应对抗菌药耐药性以及未来传染病暴发。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Motivation: 现有多任务学习方法因任务冲突问题，导致其表现不如单任务模型。同时，传统的尖锐度最小化方法（SAM）在多任务学习中应用面临方向与计算效率问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在多个多任务学习基准测试上表现优异，同时在效率上也展现出显著提升。

Conclusion: 新方法SAMO不仅有效缓解了多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，同时低计算成本使其具备实践性与推广价值。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UnIT的非结构化、推理时的剪枝方法，用于提升深度神经网络在微控制器（MCUs）上的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法多在训练或编译过程中进行，且主要依赖于结构化稀疏性，无法充分利用不支持SIMD或并行计算的设备的细粒度计算潜力。

Method: UnIT是一种轻量化方法，通过输入特定的激活模式动态决定跳过不必要的MAC操作，不需要重新训练或硬件专用化，并使用轻量化的比较代替乘法，基于阈值检查实现剪枝优化。

Result: 在MSP430微控制器上，UnIT实现了11.02%-82.03%的MAC减少，27.30%-84.19%的推理加速，以及27.33%-84.38%的能耗下降，同时保持0.48%-7%的精度下降范围。即便在领域变化下，UnIT也能达到或超越重新训练模型的精度。

Conclusion: UnIT是一种无需重新训练即可高效部署深度神经网络至微控制器的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

Abstract: Tracking the strategic focus of companies through topics in their earnings
calls is a key task in financial analysis. However, as industries evolve,
traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings
calls. We propose an LLM-agent to extract topics from documents, structure them
into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Conclusion: 生成模型存在利用模板化数据的弱点，即使普通用户也可能无意中重构敏感图像，需引起重视。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型中，分词预处理步骤阻碍了真正端到端的基础模型发展。

Method: 提出动态分块机制结合分层网络H-Net，使模型能够在字节级别的基础上进行多层抽象的层次缩放，并联合整个模型学习内容和上下文相关的分段策略。

Result: H-Net在英文字节级别模式下优于传统基于分词的Transformer模型，在数据和语言资源不足的领域如中文、代码与DNA序列上效果更显著。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了从未处理数据出发的真正端到端模型潜力，具备更好的扩展性和多样性。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

### [255] [Reinforcement Learning with Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07969)
*Qiyang Li,Zhiyuan Zhou,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-chunking是一种改进强化学习用于长时间跨度、稀疏奖励任务的方法，通过在'chunked'动作空间中运行强化学习提高了在线采样效率和探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线到在线强化学习中探索和样本效率的挑战，特别是在使用离线数据获取良好探索策略方面遇到的问题。

Method: 通过将动作分组用于时差（TD）强化学习，允许智能体在'chunked'动作空间中直接运行，并利用离线数据中的时序一致行为来增强在线探索和引入更稳定高效的n步备份。

Result: 实验表明，Q-chunking在长期稀疏奖励任务中的离线性能和在线样本效率优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking是一种有效的离线到在线强化学习方法，能够显著提高样本效率与任务表现，尤其适用于长时间跨度的稀疏奖励任务。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

### [256] [EXPO: Stable Reinforcement Learning with Expressive Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07986)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究在离线数据集的基础上，使用在线强化学习（RL）训练高表达力策略，提出了一种名为EXPO的算法，该算法结合了稳定模仿学习目标的大型表达策略与轻量化高斯编辑策略，提高样本效率并实现价值最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决使用在线强化学习训练复杂高表达力策略时的稳定价值最大化问题，其核心挑战在于如何克服长降噪链条对梯度传播的阻碍。

Method: 提出EXPO算法，该算法使用一种在线生成的RL政策，通过两个参数化策略协作工作：一个通过稳定模仿学习训练的高表达力基础策略；一个轻量级高斯编辑策略，用于优化从基础策略采样的动作。EXPO通过在基础动作和编辑动作之间选择价值最大的动作进行采样和时序差分更新。

Result: 在利用离线数据进行在线训练或微调预训练策略的场景中，该方法的样本效率比现有方法平均提高了2-3倍。

Conclusion: EXPO以高效且稳定的策略优化方式解决了在线强化学习中高表达力策略的训练问题，显著提升了样本效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

### [257] [Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996)
*Ziyue Li,Yang Li,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了预训练的大型语言模型（LLM）如何通过调整层的结构，在无需微调的情况下动态适应不同输入任务。研究提出了一种基于Monte Carlo Tree Search的CoLa方法来优化每个输入样本的模型结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练神经网络在推理时是否可以通过自适应调整架构提升任务适应性，同时减少计算成本和提高推理效率。

Method: 引入一种称为链式层（CoLa）的方法，允许LLM的各层以模块形式进行跳过、循环重复或任意重新堆叠；使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）确定每个样本最优的CoLa结构。

Result: 在数学和常识推理基准上：(1) 超过75%的正确预测样本可以找到较浅的CoLa路径，提高推理效率；(2) 超过60%的错误预测样本通过CoLa可以实现正确预测，显示性能改进潜力。

Conclusion: 固定架构的LLM在处理各种样本上的表现存在局限。本文提出的CoLa方法在增强推理效率和性能方面展示了显著潜力，为测试时深度自适应提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

*Andrew Fan,Simon D. Levy*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一个用于加速尖峰神经网络（SNN）的架构与PyTorch的SNN模型编译器，可以在低端FPGA上实现高效计算，同时资源占用较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统神经网络计算需求剧增，尖峰神经网络作为一种更节能的替代方案受到关注，但目前硬件平台对大多数人不可及。本研究探索通过低成本的FPGA来实现尖峰神经网络的有效部署。

Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased
significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential
solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1
spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate
operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for
more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating
and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and
SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider
community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve
as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many
proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN
topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN
acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting
any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a
synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture
targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.
The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves
competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further
experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking
neural networks on toy problems. All code and setup instructions are available

*Yi-Chun Hung,Gregory Schwartz,Emily A. Cooper,Emma Alexander*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种理论框架，用以解释在代谢限制和噪声影响下，神经元群体的低能耗适应行为，包括噪声增加和调谐曲线平坦化等现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学模型无法准确描述代谢限制和噪声对神经动态的影响，新数据表明神经元可通过降低能量消耗的方式实现稳定性，需要新的理论框架解释这种现象。

Method: 提出了一种基于能量预算的数学模型，结合近似射频率稳态和与噪声水平相关的能量限制，引入一种基于生物物理仿真的分散泊松噪声模型。

Result: 模型通过模拟得到最优尖峰率路径，揭示不同能量预算下神经群体调谐曲线如何适应。实验性变化如静息电位和泄漏电导的调整与模型结果一致。

Conclusion: 研究提供了能量受限条件下的最优编码策略的解析推导，揭示神经元如何在保持稳态的情况下适应代谢需求，这为理解神经编码提供了全新视角。

Abstract: Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by
metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not
accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example,
shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which
they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This
adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in
response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding
framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple
constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit
tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our
contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework
that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our
simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on
the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the
least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each
state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential
and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments
and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We
analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying
energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how
populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been
observed empirically.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对成像技术的进步，成像科学中数据量的增长迫切需要高效可靠的数据存储解决方案。

Method: 使用深度卷积神经网络（D-CNN）和矢量量化变分自动编码器（VQ-VAE）对砂岩样本的XCT数据进行压缩，并引入一个对边缘保留敏感的指标来改进解码后图像质量的评价。

Result: 不同的网络架构和压缩率对于保留后续分析重要特性有不同的适用性。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于科学家确定其数据存储和分析需求的优先级和策略。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

Conclusion: GridTD框架兼具表示能力和效率，为压缩成像重建设立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于ccRCC具有复杂的分子、病理及临床异质性，以往基于单一数据方式（如影像、病理或基因组）的预测模型效果有限，因此需要新的方法提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 通过多模态数据融合的深度学习方法可以显著提高ccRCC复发预测的精度，从而辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.
