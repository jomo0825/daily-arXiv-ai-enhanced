### [2] [Underwater Monocular Metric Depth Estimation: Real-World Benchmarks and Synthetic Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02148)
*Zijie Cai,Christopher Metzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究主要聚焦于单目深度估计在水下环境中的可靠性，提出了基于实际数据和合成数据微调模型以改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于水下光衰减、散射、颜色失真和浊度等问题导致单目深度估计性能有限，因此需提升其在水下环境中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了领域适应和尺度感知监督在提升水下环境中单目度量深度估计性能的重要性，为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has recently advanced to provide not only relative
but also metric depth predictions. However, its reliability in underwater
environments remains limited due to light attenuation and scattering, color
distortion, turbidity, and the lack of high-quality metric ground-truth data.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of zero-shot and fine-tuned
monocular metric depth estimation models on real-world underwater datasets with
metric depth annotations, such as FLSea and SQUID. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art models across a range of underwater conditions with different
ranges. Our results show that large-scale models trained on terrestrial (real
or synthetic) data, while effective in in-air settings, perform poorly
underwater due to significant domain shifts. To address this, we fine-tune
Depth Anything V2 with a ViT-S backbone encoder on a synthetic underwater
variant of the Hypersim dataset, which we generated using a physically based
underwater image formation model. We demonstrate our fine-tuned model
consistently improves performance across all benchmarks and outperforms
baselines trained only on the clean in-air Hypersim dataset. Our study provides
a detailed evaluation and visualization for monocular metric depth estimation
in underwater scenes, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation and
scale-aware supervision for achieving robust and generalizable metric depth
predictions in challenging underwater environments for future research.

### [3] [ESTR-CoT: Towards Explainable and Accurate Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02200)
*Xiao Wang,Jingtao Jiang,Qiang Chen,Lan Chen,Lin Zhu,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT框架通过链式推理提高了事件流文字识别的解释性与推理能力，并为未来基于推理的大模型发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

### [4] [Team RAS in 9th ABAW Competition: Multimodal Compound Expression Recognition Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02205)
*Elena Ryumina,Maxim Markitantov,Alexandr Axyonov,Dmitry Ryumin,Mikhail Dolgushin,Alexey Karpov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于复合表情识别（CER）的零样本多模态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决复合表情识别中多模态融合的挑战，避免依赖任务特定的训练数据。

Method: 通过六种模态（静态和动态面部表情、场景和标签匹配等）结合，多头概率融合模块（MHPF）及复合表情（CE）转换模块实现。

Result: 在AffWild2、AFEW和C-EXPR-DB数据库上分别实现了46.95%、49.02%和34.85%的F1分数，与监督学习方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 证明了提出的零样本方法在无需领域适配情况下能够有效捕获复合表情。

Abstract: Compound Expression Recognition (CER), a subfield of affective computing,
aims to detect complex emotional states formed by combinations of basic
emotions. In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for
CER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static
and dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,
and text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,
our approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene
understanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)
module that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a
Compound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability
Aggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods
to produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus
training, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%
on Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via
zero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches
trained on target data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for capturing CE without domain adaptation. The source code is
publicly available.

### [5] [SciGA: A Comprehensive Dataset for Designing Graphical Abstracts in Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02212)
*Takuro Kawada,Shunsuke Kitada,Sota Nemoto,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文引入了SciGA-145k，一个包含约145,000篇科学论文和114万张图表的大规模数据集，支持图形摘要（GA）的选择、推荐和自动生成研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何借助自动化和推荐系统解决设计有效图形摘要的挑战，从而提升科学交流的视觉化效果。

Method: 引入了SciGA-145k数据集，定义了Intra-GA推荐和Inter-GA推荐两项任务，并提出了一个新的推荐评估指标CAR以改进分析的精度。

Result: 本文提供了合理的基线模型，并通过CAR指标分析模型行为性能，从而为GA的选择和推荐提供了更精确的评价。

Conclusion: SciGA-145k为改进科学视觉交流和促进AI在科学领域的发展奠定了数据基础和评价标准。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

### [6] [Understanding Trade offs When Conditioning Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02217)
*Brandon Trabucco,Qasim Wani,Benjamin Pikus,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过扩散模型生成高质量合成数据，比较了提示式条件和布局式条件两种方法的效果，结果发现两者在不同多样性情况下适用不同策略，从而显著提高了目标检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据对于减少数据收集的时间成本至关重要，而现有方法（例如基于3D引擎的生成）效率较低且质量与真实数据存在差距。扩散模型能够快速生成高质量图像，但仍缺乏对低数据情况下的精确控制。

Method: 本文选择了80个来自四个标准目标检测基准的数据集，研究不同的条件生成方式，包括提示式条件和布局式条件，并分析了二者在多样性条件下的表现。

Result: 合成数据可以将平均精准率提高34%，某些情况下甚至提高177%。提示条件适合于狭窄条件下，而布局条件在处理高多样性任务时表现更优。

Conclusion: 在目标检测应用中，不同的生成控制策略能够提高合成数据的质量和效用，而扩散模型的应用展示了其在快速生成精准数据中的巨大潜力，尤其在低数据场景中。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

### [7] [High-Fidelity Differential-information Driven Binary Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02222)
*Tian Gao,Zhiyuan Zhang,Kaijie Yin,Xu-Cheng Zhong,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DIDB-ViT的新颖二值化视觉Transformer，在保留ViT结构和计算效率的同时，大幅缓解了信息丢失问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二值化视觉Transformer方法在性能和模块依赖上存在局限性，难以平衡高计算/存储需求与边缘设备的限制。

Method: 设计了一种结合差分信息的注意力模块，引入离散Haar小波的频率分解技术，改进了RPReLU激活函数以提升信息保留与表达能力。

Result: 实验结果显示DIDB-ViT在多种视觉Transformer架构上显著优于现有网络量化方法，在图像分类和分割任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: DIDB-ViT方法既保持了视觉Transformer的计算高效性，又显著提高了模型性能，是在二值化视觉Transformer领域的一次重要进展。

Abstract: The binarization of vision transformers (ViTs) offers a promising approach to
addressing the trade-off between high computational/storage demands and the
constraints of edge-device deployment. However, existing binary ViT methods
often suffer from severe performance degradation or rely heavily on
full-precision modules. To address these issues, we propose DIDB-ViT, a novel
binary ViT that is highly informative while maintaining the original ViT
architecture and computational efficiency. Specifically, we design an
informative attention module incorporating differential information to mitigate
information loss caused by binarization and enhance high-frequency retention.
To preserve the fidelity of the similarity calculations between binary Q and K
tensors, we apply frequency decomposition using the discrete Haar wavelet and
integrate similarities across different frequencies. Additionally, we introduce
an improved RPReLU activation function to restructure the activation
distribution, expanding the model's representational capacity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DIDB-ViT significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art network quantization methods in multiple ViT architectures,
achieving superior image classification and segmentation performance.

### [8] [FMOcc: TPV-Driven Flow Matching for 3D Occupancy Prediction with Selective State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02250)
*Jiangxia Chen,Tongyuan Huang,Ke Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FMOcc，一种基于TPV细化的占用网络，利用流匹配SSM模块和掩码训练方法，解决了少帧3D语义占用预测中的挑战，提升了效果与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在少帧3D语义占用预测中，由于图像帧数量少及3D空间冗余造成的遮挡和远距离场景预测不准问题，并减少计算资源需求。

Method: 提出FMOcc网络，包含流匹配的特征细化模块、TPV SSM层、PS3M平面选择模块及掩码训练方法。通过流匹配生成缺失特征，并筛选TPV特征以提高效率和远距离预测能力。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和OpenOcc数据集上验证了FMOcc优于现有方法，少帧输入仍实现高分，同时具有低内存需求（5.4 G）和较快推理时间（330ms）。

Conclusion: FMOcc在少帧3D语义占用预测中表现优异，提升了准确性和效率，是一种兼具性能和资源高效性的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving.
However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SurgVisAgent，一种基于多模态大语言模型的端到端智能手术视觉代理，能动态识别内窥镜图像中的失真类别和严重程度，并执行多项增强任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的增强算法通常仅限于单一任务和特定场景，无法应对复杂的现实手术场景需求。

Method: 引入多模态大语言模型以及领域专用知识，结合few-shot学习和链式推理，实现根据不同失真类型和严重程度定制化图像增强。

Result: 在模拟真实手术失真的基准测试中，SurgVisAgent的表现优于传统单任务模型。

Conclusion: SurgVisAgent展示了其作为统一手术辅助解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的单标签分类方法无法准确反映飓风后损害的复杂性，亟需一种能够有效评估多种损害类型的技术。

Method: 提出的框架结合了基于ResNet的特征提取模块和类别特定的注意力机制，能够在单张图像中识别多种损害类型。

Conclusion: 新框架提升了灾害评估的精准性和效率，为未来的灾害响应与恢复策略提供帮助。

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference
on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3CE 2025), and the camera-ready version
will appear in the official conference proceedings.

Conclusion: BiDA框架通过创新的模型设计和学习策略，有效提升了复杂场景下高光谱图像分类任务的适配性与精度。

Abstract: Utilizing hyperspectral remote sensing technology enables the extraction of
fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be
available from the website:

Conclusion: MAC-Lookup模型有效提升了水下图像的视觉质量，为水下图像增强提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing underwater images is crucial for exploration. These images face
visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater
challenges. Extensive experiments show that MAC-Lookup excels in enhancing
underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于自蒸馏的方法来改进视频到音频（V2A）生成模型，尤其是针对电影语言场景中仅部分可见的情况，获得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标仅部分可见的电影语言表达场景表现较差，需要新方法解决此问题。

Method: 通过自蒸馏策略，学生模型学习配对的音频与部分可见视频特征对齐关系，从而捕捉声音与视觉信息的部分关联。

Result: 改善了在部分可见场景下的V2A生成效果，并提升了在大规模数据集VGGSound上的表现。

Conclusion: 新方法有效应对了电影语言和部分目标可见性问题，为V2A生成模型的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉编码器中间层视觉令牌压缩框架 LaCo，展示了其在效率与性能方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉令牌压缩方法主要在编码器之后进行，效率提升效果受限，因此需要在视觉编码器中间层实现更高效的压缩方法。

Method: 提出 LaCo 框架，该框架包含：1) 基于逐层像素洗牌机制通过空间到通道的转换合并相邻令牌；2) 残差学习架构，利用非参数快捷通道保留关键信息。

Result: 实验证明 LaCo 在视觉编码器中间层令牌压缩方面表现优于现有方法，同时训练效率提高超过 20%，推理吞吐量提升超过 15%。

Conclusion: LaCo 框架能够在提高多模态大语言模型效率的同时，保持强大的性能表现。

Abstract: Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

TL;DR: ViRefSAM通过两大关键模块扩展SAM，实现无需人工提示的高效遥感图像分割，并在多个基准测试中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进现有Segment Anything Model (SAM)，以解决其在遥感图像分割中的局限性，如人工提示繁琐和领域适应性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为ViRefSAM的框架，设计了两个关键模块：视觉上下文提示编码器（生成特定语义提示）和动态目标对齐适配器（减少领域差异并专注目标区域）。

Result: 在iSAID-5^i、LoveDA-2^i和COCO-20^i这三个少样本分割基准测试数据集上，ViRefSAM在未见类别的分割任务中表现出的精确度和自动化优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViRefSAM有效解决了遥感图像分割中SAM的局限性，不借助人工提示可高效分割未见类别，展现出广泛的适用性和优异性能。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits
strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

Motivation: 现有单视角生成存在可控性问题，因此希望通过多视角信息提升生成质量和可控性。

Method: 通过3D提升模块提取物体3D表示，再经多视图融合模块渲染目标视图特征，并结合预训练扩散模型进行新视角生成。

Result: 实验表明，DreamComposer++能无缝集成并提升当前视图感知扩散模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: DreamComposer++可实现可控的3D物体重建，并具备广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in leveraging pre-trained 2D diffusion models achieve the
generation of high-quality novel views from a single in-the-wild image.
However, existing works face challenges in producing controllable novel views
due to the lack of information from multiple views. In this paper, we present
DreamComposer++, a flexible and scalable framework designed to improve current
view-aware diffusion models by incorporating multi-view conditions.
Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to
extract 3D representations of an object from various views. These
representations are then aggregated and rendered into the latent features of
target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video
diffusion models for novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate
that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware
diffusion models and enhances their abilities to generate controllable novel
views from multi-view conditions. This advancement facilitates controllable 3D
object reconstruction and enables a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Flow-CDNet是一种有效的变化检测网络，能够实现同时检测慢速和快速变化，并具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between
bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

Motivation: 为解决关键点检测任务中依靠强监督或手工设计损失函数的挑战，寻求一种仅依赖类别标签的弱监督方法。

Method: 通过引入渗漏最大池化（LMP）层，鼓励卷积滤波器学习对关键点敏感的非重复局部模式，并提出学习型聚类层对关键点提议进行分组生成预测。还采用可视化指导的选择策略，确保滤波器激活一致性和注意力分布。

Conclusion: LMPNet通过直接操控网络滤波器实现解释性强的关键点检测，证明弱监督方法的潜力，可推广于弱监督计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the task of semantic object keypoint discovery
weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

Conclusion: 当前的大脑解码模型尚未完全挖掘和整合fMRI的信息；利用这些丰富的多语义和空间线索具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-vision decoding have driven significant progress,
reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAGIC的生成方法，用于解决工业质量控制中少样本异常生成问题，并在MVTec-AD数据集上取得了领先表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常生成方法在保持正常背景、精准覆盖异常区域及生成语义合理的异常位置方面存在不足。

Method: MAGIC方法基于稳定扩散模型，通过多层次扰动和上下文对齐模块进行优化，其中包括：高斯扰动扩展异常整体外观、基于掩码的局部噪声注入和上下文感知掩码对齐模块，使生成的异常真实多样且符合语义。

Result: MAGIC在保持背景完整、精准覆盖异常掩码和生成语义合理的异常位置方面表现优秀，并在MVTec-AD数据集中超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC方法全面解决了少样本异常生成中的主要缺陷，可以生成语义合理的多样异常数据，为工业质量控制提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Motivation: 现有评价指标主要集中在视觉质量和时间一致性，但缺乏对合成视频在文本到视频检索等下游任务中表现的深入洞察。因此需要一个新的基准来评估这种效用。

Method: 提出了SynTVA数据集，通过从MSRVTT训练集中提取的800种用户查询，生成合成视频，并根据四个核心语义维度标注这些视频的文本对齐性。同时开发了自动评估器（Auto-Evaluator）来预测对齐质量。

Result: SynTVA数据集可以用于选择高效用的合成样本，从而显著改善文本到视频检索任务的表现。此外，通用的视频质量评估指标与语义对齐维度之间存在关联。

Conclusion: SynTVA为数据集增强和合成样本选择提供了重要设计，同时验证了合成视频在下游任务中的价值，为未来合成视频评估和应用提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) synthesis has advanced rapidly, yet current evaluation
metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

TL;DR: InnerControl通过在生成模型的整个扩散过程中的训练策略进行空间对齐并提高生成质量和控制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本转图像扩散模型取得了显著进展，但生成输出的精确空间控制仍具有挑战性。

Method: 提出InnerControl策略，利用轻量卷积探针，在每个去噪步骤中从UNet特征中重建输入控制信号，并在整个扩散过程中优化对齐损失。

Result: InnerControl结合ControlNet++等技术，实现了多种条件方法的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地提高了控制保真度和生成质量，适用于多种条件输入。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-to-image diffusion models, achieving
precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Method: 设计了Hita这一新型图像分词器，采用整体到局部的分层编码方案，并结合因果注意力机制及轻量化信息融合模块来控制生成过程中的信息流。

Conclusion: Hita能够有效地捕捉图像的全局性质（例如纹理、材料、形状），为提升AR图像生成模型的效率和效果提供了创新方法。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Conclusion: LocalDyGS创新性地提供了一种新框架，不仅提升了动态场景的建模能力，同时拓展了原有技术的应用范围，对实现更逼真的动态场景合成具有重要意义。

Abstract: Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

### [29] [UVLM: Benchmarking Video Language Model for Underwater World Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02373)
*Xizhe Xue,Yang Zhou,Dawei Yan,Ying Li,Haokui Zhang,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个名为UVLM的水下观察基准数据集，通过结合人类专业知识和AI模型高质量构建，涵盖海洋生物和环境的多样性任务，目的是推动视频语言模型在水下领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频语言模型（VidLMs）主要关注地面场景，忽略了对水下观察的需求，因此需要构建一个专门的水下任务数据集以弥补这一空白。

Method: 创建UVLM数据集，视频选取考虑水下挑战（光照变化、水体浑浊度、视角），并涵盖419种海洋生物及多样静态植物和地形；任务设计分为生物类和环境类共20种任务；提供评估多种方法的定量指标。

Result: 实验显示，在UVLM数据集上微调的VidLMs显著提升了对水下世界的理解能力，并在一些地面基准任务上也有潜在的微幅改善。

Conclusion: UVLM作为新颖的水下视频基准为推动水下AI应用提供了重要支持，数据集和提示工程将公开，为研究领域带来新机遇。

Abstract: Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种全新的伪标注框架，通过使用仅包含视频数据的方案来解决单目3D目标检测中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注成本高和2D到3D的内在模糊性，M3OD长期受到数据稀缺问题的制约，需要一种无需高成本且鲁棒性强的方法来提高性能。

Method: 设计了一种新的伪标注框架，该框架通过时间连续帧的目标点跟踪，聚合静态与动态物体的伪LiDAR数据，实现3D属性提取，同时不要求多视角设置、附加传感器、摄像机姿态或特定领域训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法具有可靠的准确性和强大的可扩展性，解决了3D数据采集受限的场景问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架是一种实用且高效的解决单目3D目标检测问题的方案，具备较好的应用前景。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) has long faced challenges due to data
scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

*Byung Hyun Lee,Wongi Jeong,Woojae Han,Kyoungbun Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为CoMEL的框架，用于在连续多实例学习中实现精确定位和最小遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有多实例学习在持续任务中定位能力弱以及遗忘问题，并将重点放在实例分类和定位上。

Method: 设计了三个核心组件：（1）GDAT用于高效实例编码；（2）BPPL实现可靠的实例伪标签生成；（3）OWLoRA减少了分类遗忘问题。

Result: CoMEL在三个公开的病理切片数据集上表现优异，在袋级准确率和定位准确率上显著领先于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoMEL解决了持续多实例学习中的困难，能实现高效且可靠的定位与最小遗忘，推动了这一领域的发展。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via
bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了利用像素级时间不一致性检测深度伪造视频的新方法，大幅提升对多样化的伪造检测场景的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于空间频率的检测器无法有效识别像素平面中的时间伪影，因此需要探索更敏感的像素级时间特征检测方法。

Method: 通过对每个像素的时间轴执行1D傅里叶变换提取时间频率特征，结合一种注意力提案模块定位伪影区域，并使用联合变换器模块融合像素时间频率和时空上下文特征来扩展检测能力范围。

Result: 提出的框架在深度伪造视频检测领域实现了鲁棒且广泛适用的检测性能，可应对多种复杂场景。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的能力，同时提出的像素级时间特征提取和时空上下文整合可作为未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为TAB Net的新型弱监督医疗图像分割框架，其结合了三重增强自恢复模块(TAS)和边界感知伪标签监督模块(BAP)，在稀疏标注下实现了高效且精准的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取大规模、完全标注的医疗图像数据集耗时且昂贵，本文旨在通过引入稀疏标注（如scribble标注）来探讨在减少标注成本的情况下，对医疗图像进行高效分割的可能性。

Method: 提出TAB Net框架，其中TAS模块通过三种增强策略（强度变换、cutout、拼图增强）提升特征学习能力，BAP模块通过伪标签和边界感知损失改进伪监督准确性及边界建模。

Result: 在ACDC和MSCMR seg两个公共数据集上的实验表明，TAB Net显著优于基于scribble标注的最新方法，并取得了接近完全监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: TAB Net提供了一种在稀疏标注条件下进行医疗图像分割的高效方案，能以较低的标注成本实现高质量的分割。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动物重新识别方法依赖大量标注数据，但获取这些标注通常昂贵且耗时，因此需要探索自监督学习技术来降低对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 通过时间上相关的图像对（来自摄像机捕捉视频流）自动提取同一动物的不同视图，并利用这些数据训练自监督学习模型。

Result: 实验表明，自监督学习模型相比监督学习方法，在有限标注和下游任务中的表现更优。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在动物重新识别任务中表现出巨大潜力，不依赖标注数据的特性使其更加适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species
across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Conclusion: 该方法有效融合自动编码器与扩散模型的优势，提供了一种可用于脑图像处理及无监督伪影恢复的潜力工具。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing
the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

Motivation: 解决热成像图像中行人检测和跟踪精度受低级特征表示的限制问题，满足低光环境下的视频监控需求。

Method: 设计了两阶段优化框架，通过针对性地调节每阶段的超参数来实现无需复杂重识别或运动模型的行人跟踪。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是一种适用于实际监控应用的高效解决方案，能够在热成像条件下实现实时、高精度的多目标跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

Motivation: 随着短视频平台的兴起，长视频内容变成简洁精彩的片段需求增加，现有方法难以充分利用视频丰富的视觉信息，影响输出的连贯性。

Method: 提出HIVE框架，利用多模态大语言模型实现角色提取、对话分析和叙事总结；通过场景级分割，将编辑过程分解为精彩片段选择、开头/结尾选择及无关内容删减。

Conclusion: HIVE框架能更全面理解视频内容，有效提升编辑质量，为视频自动编辑提供新方法，并引入了DramaAD数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Abstract: Face identification systems operating in the ciphertext domain have garnered
significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Conclusion: AvatarMakeup方法实现了虚拟化身妆容转移的一致性、身份保持及细节处理，具有重大应用潜力。

Abstract: Similar to facial beautification in real life, 3D virtual avatars require
personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在实现强大视觉语言能力的同时，其视觉模态存在的安全漏洞限制了其在开放环境中的应用，本研究希望通过更多具象化、真实场景的攻击来探索并解决这些问题。

Method: 定义视觉为核心的'视觉越狱'新设定，设计了一种名为VisCo的攻击方法，包括4种视觉中重点策略、动态图像生成、自动毒性模糊与语义优化等步骤，旨在通过指定的黑箱模型引发有害反应。

Result: 实验表明，VisCo在MM-SafetyBench测试中性能显著优于基线，对GPT-4o的毒性评分达4.78，攻击成功率（ASR）达85%，相比基线的2.48毒性评分和22.2% ASR有极大提升。

Conclusion: VisCo突破了现有的基于视觉模态设计的攻击局限，通过更真实的语境和视觉策略显著提高了对多模态语言模型的攻击成功率，为相关模型的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

### [42] [F^2TTA: Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation on Cross-Domain Medical Image Classification via Image-Level Disentangled Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02437)
*Wei Li,Jingyang Zhang,Lihao Liu,Guoan Wang,Junjun He,Yang Chen,Lixu Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的测试时间适配（TTA）方法，通过图像层面的解耦提示调优(I-DiPT)框架，以应对医疗数据领域复杂的碎片化数据到达问题并提高模型适配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法通常假设数据以完整域单元到达，但在现实医疗场景中，数据存在碎片化且到达顺序随机，这种复杂数据模式可能会扰乱适配过程。需要一种应对这种复杂情况的解决方案。

Method: 提出I-DiPT框架，利用图像不变提示和图像特定提示来分别提取域不变特征和适配每个测试图像。此外，通过不确定性驱动的遮蔽一致性学习和并行图网络知识蒸馏，增强提示的知识表达能力。

Result: 在乳腺癌和青光眼分类数据集上的实验中证明，与现有TTA方法相比，该方法在应对自由形式的域碎片数据时表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: I-DiPT框架能够有效适应碎片化和随机顺序的域数据，具有在实际医疗场景中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究通过FINN架构在FPGA的PL中部署了三种神经网络（ANNs），证明了FPGA可以加速神经网络，并使其适用于注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人在检测物体时需要减速，并且由于算法限制，执行任务时受到约束且耗时。研究旨在提高检测算法在FPGA上的性能，以解决上述问题。

Method: 利用FINN架构，在FPGA的PL中部署了三种ANN模型：使用4位量化的MobileNet v1，使用2位量化和1位量化的CNV模型，同时采用自构建的RG2C数据集进行训练。

Result: MobileNet v1在98%的成功率下实现了6611 FPS的推理速度，显著提升了神经网络在FPGA上的性能表现。

Conclusion: 研究证明FPGA可加速ANNs的性能，使其适用于注意力机制，从而提升了机器人的任务执行效率。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

### [44] [IGDNet: Zero-Shot Robust Underexposed Image Enhancement via Illumination-Guided and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02445)
*Hailong Yan,Junjian Huang,Tingwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGDNet是一种面向单张测试图片的零样本增强方法，针对低曝光图像增强问题，显著提升了视觉质量和性能，且无需配对数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖监督学习和配对数据集，但收集这些数据在真实场景中不现实。此外，现有方法可能过度增强，导致图像失真。

Method: 开发了IGDNet，包括分解模块和去噪模块。分解模块使用网络将图像分解为光照和反射成分；去噪模块通过像素自适应校正方法增强非均匀照明区域，并通过下采样和迭代生成最终结果。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，IGDNet在复杂光照条件下显著提升了视觉质量。PSNR达到20.41dB，SSIM达到0.860dB，优于14种当前无监督方法。

Conclusion: IGDNet无需先验信息或训练数据，具备很强的泛化能力与降噪效果，为低曝光图像增强问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for restoring underexposed images typically rely on
supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 目前红外小目标检测算法多依赖于完全监督的方法，需要大量标注数据，而标注低质量红外视频序列成本高、效率低。因此，探索非完全监督方法成为必要。

Method: 设计了基于预训练SAM模型的潜在目标挖掘策略，采用对比学习提高伪标签的可靠性，并提出了一种长短期运动感知学习方法以同时建模小目标的局部运动模式和全局运动轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的弱监督方法在两个公共数据集上优于早期的完全监督方法，性能达到SOTA完全监督方法的90%以上。

Conclusion: 该研究首次探索了弱监督红外小目标检测并取得显著效果，表明弱监督策略在减少标注成本上具有巨大潜力，同时保证了检测效果。

Abstract: Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格标记化方法会重复生成顶点标记，从而浪费了模型的网络能力。

Method: 通过在网格顶点标记化期间仅访问每个顶点一次，从而将标记序列冗余减少了50%，并通过高效表示实现了22%的压缩率。

Result: 生成的多边形网格具有优越的几何属性，包括流形拓扑、水密性和一致的面法线。实验结果表明，它在网格生成复杂性和几何完整性方面表现优越。

Conclusion: Mesh Silksong在实现压缩的同时提高了网格生成效率和几何属性，为实际应用提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Mesh Silksong, a compact and efficient mesh representation
tailored to generate the polygon mesh in an auto-regressive manner akin to silk
weaving. Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with
repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach
tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the
token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art
compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces
polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新提出的大规模多人跟踪数据集，名为CrowdTrack，专注于复杂场景下的行人跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标跟踪（MOT）数据集在场景复杂性和真实感方面存在不足，难以支持复杂场景的行人跟踪问题研究，因此需要一个更为真实复杂的数据集。

Method: 作者创建了一个名为CrowdTrack的数据集，包含从第一人称视角拍摄的33个视频，共5185条目标轨迹，每个目标都提供完整框注解和唯一ID。

Result: 对该数据集进行了全面分析，并测试了多种SOTA模型及基础模型在其上的性能。

Conclusion: CrowdTrack为研究人员提供了一个在复杂场景下开发多目标跟踪算法的平台，有助于推进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Method: 提出了MedFormer，包括两个核心创新：一种金字塔缩放结构用于通用的各种医学任务；引入一种具备内容感知的双稀疏选择注意机制（DSSA）以提高计算效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析及大量实验表明，MedFormer相较于现有医学视觉变换器在各种医学数据集上的性能更优，适用于图像分类、语义分割及病灶检测等任务。

Conclusion: MedFormer利用金字塔结构和DSSA机制实现了高效性、鲁棒性和通用性，能够大幅提升医疗图像识别的效果，并有助于临床诊断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种结合时间相关性的监督对比损失方法，用于提升结肠镜检查中息肉计数的效果，减少了碎片化率，实现了领域内最新水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前关于结肠镜息肉计数的方法主要依赖自监督学习，重点关注视觉特征，忽视了时间关系，这限制了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种新的时间相关监督对比损失，结合时间软目标捕获息肉的内部变化，同时保持不同息肉间的可辨性。另外，通过引入时间邻接约束改进轨迹簇的生成，减少了视觉相似但时间上距离较远的轨迹的误匹配。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法将碎片化率降低了2.2倍，并通过留一法交叉验证验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，考虑时间因素对于提升结肠镜息肉计数的重要性，提出的办法达到了新的标准，并且代码已公开供研究者使用。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，MC-INR在科学数据编码任务上的表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MC-INR在编码复杂科学数据方面更灵活高效，可解决多变量和非结构化网格数据的问题。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection in RGB images is a key task in pedestrian safety, as the
most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

Abstract: This paper introduces IMASHRIMP, an adapted system for the automated
morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological

Motivation: 为了解决单张图像中几何估计的挑战，特别是如何在保持相对几何准确的同时恢复真实度量尺度几何。

Method: 基于MoGe方法，改进并扩展到度量尺度预测；开发数据精炼方法，用高质量的合成标签对真实数据进行过滤和补全。

Result: 通过在大规模多样化数据集上训练与评估，展示了在实现相对几何、度量尺度和精细细节恢复上的卓越性能。

Conclusion: MoGe-2成功整合了几何预测的精确性和细节完整性，解决了此前方法未能综合达成的技术难题。

Abstract: We propose MoGe-2, an advanced open-domain geometry estimation model that
recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

TL;DR: 该研究提出一个整合多种血管表示形式的框架，通过可微分变换将体素化、网格和参数化模型结合起来，并进行形状到分割拟合以提取高精度网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前血管研究中常见的三种表示形式常被分开使用，未能充分利用它们的优点，且提取这些形式通常依赖于分割结果。

Method: 利用可微分体素化技术，从形状到分割拟合的过程中学习参数化血管模型。这种模型通过三次B样条对血管中心线和半径进行参数化，并生成高保真网格。

Result: 在主动脉、动脉瘤和脑血管的实验中，方法在体积拟合上表现出了对复杂几何结构的高精确度捕获能力。

Conclusion: 方法在不需要真实参数的情况下，成功地将三种不同的血管表示统一起来，为复杂血管结构建模和操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种框架$S^2DC$，通过增强结构感知的语义一致性和差异性，改进3D医学图像自监督学习方法（mSSL）的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的mSSL方法未能充分考虑解剖结构的大小、位置及形态变化对语义表达的影响。

Method: 通过假设同一结构内的patch具有相同语义，而不同结构的patch则具有不同语义，提出$S^2DC$框架，以最优传输策略实现语义差异性；通过邻域相似性分布提升语义一致性。

Result: 该框架在10个数据集、4个任务、3种模态的评估中，均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $S^2DC$成功通过桥接patch级和结构级表征，实现了结构感知的语义表征，展示了其广泛的医学分析潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image self-supervised learning (mSSL) holds great promise for
medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是解决长视频理解中的计算复杂性和内存成本问题，尤其是Transformer模型在处理长序列时的限制。

Method: 提出AuroraLong，采用线性RNN语言模型代替传统Transformer，同时结合视觉标记合并和重新排列技术以提升效率。模型具有2B参数，仅使用公开数据集进行训练。

Result: AuroraLong在多个视频基准测试中实现了与相似规模的Transformer模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: AuroraLong展示了线性RNN在长视频理解中的潜力，降低了计算门槛，为其广泛使用铺平了道路。此外，该方法是首个在LLaVA模型中使用线性RNN的尝试。

Abstract: The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Motivation: 解决现有AIGI检测技术缺乏人类可验证解释和泛化能力的问题，保障公共信息安全。

Method: 提出Holmes-Set大规模数据集（包括SFT与DPO子集），以及Holmes Pipeline三阶段框架：视觉专家预训练、监督微调和直接偏好优化，并结合跨模态视觉-语义推理的协同解码策略。

Result: 经过三个基准的广泛实验验证，Holmes Pipeline提升了AIGI检测的性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: Holmes-Set与Holmes Pipeline有效解决了现有AIGI检测技术的问题，增强了泛化能力和人类验证的解释能力，推动了AI生成内容检测技术的发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to
the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

Motivation: 当前方法中，Plug-and-Play方法虽然灵活但依赖近似，而专用条件DM则需要监督训练，缺乏通用性和灵活性。本文旨在提高精度和效率的同时保留方法的灵活性。

Method: 框架通过对一个马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）算法（LATINO Langevin采样器）的展开，并结合深度展开和模型蒸馏，生成少步条件后验采样模型。

Result: 实验表明，本文方法在准确性、计算效率以及应对推理时前向模型变化的灵活性方面表现卓越。

Conclusion: 本文方法是深度展开首次应用于蒙特卡洛采样，提供了一种高效且灵活的后验采样方案，适用于不同前向模型的推断。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Motivation: 针对深度学习扩散模型中，由于数据限制引起的过拟合、丧失先验知识以及文本对齐能力退化的问题进行研究。

Method: 设计了APT框架，由三部分组成：适应性调整训练、表示稳定化以及先验知识的注意力对齐，每个部分分别解决过拟合问题的特定方面。

Conclusion: APT框架成功克服了扩散模型个性化训练中的多种问题，对生成任务有显著改进，有望在相关领域进一步应用。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频换脸方法难以同时实现高质量身份迁移和动态属性保持。问题的根源在于视频中面部外观和运动信息的耦合。

Method: 提出CanonSwap框架，首先移除运动相关信息，将身份修改在统一的规范化空间进行。然后将交换后的特征重新整合到原视频中。同时，设计了局部身份调制模块，仅针对面部区域进行修改，并引入细化的同步评估标准。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量、时间一致性和身份保持方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CanonSwap框架通过解耦实现了高效的身份迁移和动态属性保持，并提出了新的评估标准，为视频换脸研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video face swapping aims to address two primary challenges: effectively
transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

Result: 在3D重建、理解以及二者的联合任务上实现了最新的性能表现。

Conclusion: SIU3R充分展现了无对齐框架的优势及两任务互惠设计的有效性，为通用的3D理解和重建提供了新方向。

Abstract: Simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction plays an important role in
developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed
images. Specifically, SIU3R bridges reconstruction and understanding tasks via
pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

Abstract: Although significant advancements have been achieved in the progress of
keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

Result: 该方法显著改善了在人像细节（如面部和手部）的生成效果，同时保持整体图像质量。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，FairHuman方法在不同场景下提高了人像图像生成性能，尤其是在局部细节生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Abstract: Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Abstract: The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

Conclusion: 新方法为灾后侦查提供了更加精准的指导，能够更有效地支持地震后的灾害响应与救援工作。

Abstract: In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in
generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过利用强大的语义先验和参考图像，显著减少了人工提示的需求，实现了优异表现，展示了该方法在分割任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The performance of image segmentation models has historically been
constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation
metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),
PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free
approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).

Motivation: 克服现有单目视频生成的可动画头像在非线性变形和复杂细节中的表现不足的问题，满足增强和虚拟现实中的需求。

Method: 提出将3D高斯扩展为高维多元高斯（HyperGaussians），并通过'逆协方差技巧'提升计算效率，结合现有模型如FlashAvatar进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，HyperGaussians在处理高频细节（如眼镜框、牙齿、复杂面部运动和镜面反射）上，在数值和视觉效果上均优于传统的3DGS。

Conclusion: HyperGaussians具有显著的表现力和计算效率，为单目视频的高质量动态面部生成提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

Method: 提出了TriMap视频扩散模型生成外观、几何与语义，同时开发了语言量化压缩器（LQC），以高效编码语言嵌入，无需每场景重新训练。

Result: LangScene-X在实际数据上的质量和泛化能力优于现有技术。

Conclusion: LangScene-X有效统一生成了3D一致的多模态信息，展示了语言嵌入与语义查询的新能力。

Abstract: Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

Conclusion: DCDP-HAR框架在解决多模态传感器HAR领域的关键挑战中表现出了显著有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a core technology that
enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的USAD网络通过多种创新方法显著提升了人类活动识别的准确性和效率，并成功验证其在实际应用中的易用性和有效性。

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Result: AnyI2V展现了卓越性能，在空间和运动控制视频生成提供了新视角。

Conclusion: AnyI2V解决了现有方法在运动控制和编辑能力上的缺陷，为灵活的视频生成扩展了可能性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种方法，通过融入Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理数据，提高了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在数据有限情况下处理专业视觉任务的能力，尤其是在图表、表格等非物体类图像领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在专业视觉任务（例如图表理解）中表现有限，这是由于预训练数据集与下游任务数据集之间的匹配问题。一些专业任务所需数据较少，难以直接微调模型。

Method: 论文提出了一个名为Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT)的策略，通过将基础信息（例如边界框）注入到CoT推理数据中来改进推理步骤的真实性。GCoT方法基于自举思想，增强了模型对非物体类图像的理解能力。

Result: 在五种专业视觉任务（涉及图表、表格、收据和报告的不同视觉形式）中验证了方法的有效性。结果表明，在数据有限的情况下，GCoT显著优于传统微调与蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于CoT且经过改进的推理数据，GCoT有效缓解了数据有限场景下的模型适配问题，为专业视觉任务的处理提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Conclusion: EasyCache兼具高效性与易用性，为高质量视频生成的研究和实践提供了一个极具吸引力的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video

collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RefTok的新的参考式编码方法，能有效捕捉视频的复杂时序动态与上下文信息，显著优化视频建模任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频建模方法难以有效捕捉视频中的时序依赖性与冗余性。为解决这一难题，提出了基于参考帧的RefTok方法，从而更好地保留视频帧之间的连续性及内容表达。

Method: 通过引入未量化的参考帧，采用参考式编码方式对视频的一组帧进行编码与解码。RefTok保持了视频帧中运动的连续性与物体外观的一致性。

Result: RefTok在四个视频数据集(K600, UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, DAVIS)上显著优于当前先进的方法（如Cosmos和MAGVIT），在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等指标上平均提高了36.7%。此外，基于RefTok压缩表达的生成模型在视频生成任务中大幅超越了同类和更大模型。

Conclusion: RefTok展示了在视频建模任务中的强大性能，通过有效捕捉时序信息，显著提升了视频编码压缩和生成的效果。

Abstract: Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准(McBE)，旨在解决现有偏见评估数据集在偏见类别和文化适用性上的局限性，并对多个流行的大型语言模型进行了分析和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前用于偏见评估的数据集大多集中于英语和北美文化，与其他文化的偏见类别不完全适配，且在中文语言和文化背景下的资源短缺。此外，这些数据集通常只支持单一评估任务，无法从多个方面评估大型语言模型中的偏见。

Method: 设计并开发了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准(McBE)，包含4,077个偏见评估实例，涵盖12种主要偏见类别、82个子类别及5种评估任务，注重类别覆盖、多样性和评估全面性。

Result: 通过McBE对多个不同系列、不同参数规模的大型语言模型进行了评估，结果表明这些模型普遍存在不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对大型语言模型中偏见问题的深入分析，强调了构建多文化、多任务偏见评估工具的重要性，为后续研究和改进提供了新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了推理型和非推理型大语言模型在对话摘要任务中的表现，发现推理型模型不一定优于非推理型模型，存在冗长和事实不一致等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索长链推理架构（如OpenAI-o1和DeepSeek-R1）在对话摘要任务中的实际应用效果。

Method: 使用三种主要对话摘要范式（通用摘要、角色导向摘要和查询导向摘要），结合多个对话数据集（SAMSum、DialogSum等）及先进的评估协议，对推理型和非推理型模型进行系统性评估。

Result: 研究发现，显式推理并不总能提高对话摘要质量，推理型模型常存在冗长、事实错误和不够简洁的问题，非推理型模型反而表现更佳。

Conclusion: 当前推理型大语言模型在复杂对话摘要任务中存在显著局限性，需要针对实际场景研发更精准的建模和评估方法。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

TL;DR: 本文研究Huginn-3.5B模型在算术任务中的推理行为，发现隐含链式推理能力有限，并且复用层的深度增加也未带来显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于Transformer语言模型在多步复杂推理上进行改进，通过外化链式推理提高可解释性，但效率有所损失。本研究旨在探讨隐含链式推理是否能通过复用层结构而在隐空间中实现。

Method: 研究采用了Huginn-3.5B模型，这是一种基于深度递归的Transformer，复用层以不增加模型参数为前提进行推理分析；同时使用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等方法对算术任务的隐状态进行探测和观察。

Result: 实验表明，模型在隐状态中展现有限的可解释性，且这种能力受层索引和解码方法影响很大；此外，复用层数的增加带来的性能提升有限，未能达到显式链式推理模型的效果。

Conclusion: 传统模型外显的推理过程更优于隐含推理结构，增加复用层深度难以有效提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

Motivation: GDC提供高质量癌症基因组数据，但初学者可能难以在大量可能的字段中找到合适的队列描述，而自然语言可能是更直观的方式。

Method: 开发了一种工具，允许用户通过自然语言描述定义GDC的患者队列，并利用交互式界面进一步优化。多种大语言模型被开发和评估，以实现这一功能。

Result: 开发并验证了GDC Cohort Copilot工具，并证明其局部运行的大模型在生成患者队列过滤器时性能优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot显著简化了基因组患者队列的定义过程，为研究者提供了更加直接、高效的交互方式，并通过其开放源码架构支持社区进一步优化和扩展。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.

Result: MemAgent成功从训练的8K上下文扩展至32K，并能以性能损失低于5%的水平处理3.5M任务；在512K的RULER测试中表现达95%以上。

Conclusion: MemAgent为长文档处理提供了一种有效解决方案，显著提升了上下文扩展能力且性能损失较小。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

Conclusion: DoMIX克服了传统领域自适应预训练的主要挑战，既提高了效率，又增强了针对性，为实际任务提供了更适合的预训练模型。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为QFFN-BERT的混合量子-经典Transformer模型，通过用参数化量子电路(PQC)替代标准Transformer中FFN模块，大幅减少模型参数，同时实现高效训练与准确性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFN模块在标准Transformer中占据了约三分之二的参数，研究尝试通过引入PQC优化该模块以提升模型参数效率和表现。

Method: 使用PQC替换BERT的FFN模块，设计包含残差连接的PQC架构以及旋转和纠缠策略以确保模型的训练稳定性和表达能力，同时针对PQC深度与模型性能进行了系统研究。

Result: 在SST-2和DBpedia任务上，优化后的QFFN-BERT超越了原始模型的性能，且将FFN相关参数减少了99%以上，特别是在小样本学习场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: PQC在结合深度学习基础原则时，可以成为经典FFN的高效替代方案，既提高了参数效率，又保持甚至超越了模型的基线性能。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

Result: 实验表明，仅用10K样本，性能在HumanEval中提高2.4%，MBPP中提高2.3%，优于92K样本全量基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著减少计算成本的同时，提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决目前ASR模型在跨领域场景泛化能力的评估不足问题，研究针对Akan语构建全面的评测框架。

Method: 通过应用四个包含不同领域的Akan语语音数据集，对七种基于Transformer架构（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2）的ASR模型进行评估，并分析错误模式。

Result: 研究揭示了ASR模型在域内和域外性能的显著差异，并发现了Whisper和Wav2Vec2在错误输出方面的特异性表现。

Conclusion: ASR模型在低资源语言应用中需要权衡可读性与透明度，并采用更具适应性的领域迁移与多语言训练方法。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy

outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

*Cornelia Gruber,Helen Alber,Bernd Bischl,Göran Kauermann,Barbara Plank,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 有监督学习中的标签差异（LV）普遍存在，但传统假设常忽略人为标签差异（HLV）的重要性。本研究提出考虑HLV的主动学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前有监督学习对高质量标签数据依赖性强，但现有框架忽略了标签差异中的信息价值，尤其是人为标签差异（HLV）。

Method: 提出一种新的概念框架，将HLV纳入主动学习循环，包括实例选择、注释者选择和标签表示。同时探讨如何将大型语言模型（LLM）作为注释工具。

Result: 总结了标签差异领域与主动学习领域的已有工作，并分析它们在HLV处理上的不足，提出理解与利用HLV的新方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为HLV感知的主动学习奠定了概念基础，更符合真实世界注释中的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

*Xin Guan,PeiHsin Lin,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Ruibo Zhang,Emre Kazim,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Multiperspective Fusion (MPF)的新框架，通过多视角生成对齐大语言模型的输出与人类基线分布，减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对已有大语言模型容易出现偏差问题，提出一种无需重新微调或大量提示工程的新方法以实现偏差缓解。

Method: 在SAGED管线基础上，利用多视角生成方法对输出进行对齐，拆解人类基线的组成部分，并通过概率加权采样来引导模型生成。

Result: 能够有效对齐表征的情感分布，减少KL散度和校准误差，并能泛化到未见问题。

Conclusion: MPF是一种可扩展且具解释性的大语言模型后处理对齐框架，无需复杂提示工程或微调，适配性强。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何利用LLMs（大语言模型）辅助科学论文的审稿过程，特别是在识别论文局限性方面，并提出了一个新的基准工具LimitGen。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学出版物数量的增长，传统的人力审稿面临越来越大的挑战，而LLMs有潜力在支持审稿方面发挥作用。

Method: 提出了一个局限性类型的分类体系，并基于此开发了LimitGen基准工具（包括合成数据集和真实人类写作的局限性数据集），并通过文献检索增强LLMs识别局限性的能力。

Result: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在科学研究中生成论文局限性方面的能力，从而为审稿过程提供了更具体、建设性的反馈。

Conclusion: 通过LimitGen以及对LLMs的增强，展示了自动化技术在提升科学审稿质量和效率中的潜力。

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

*Peter Viechnicki*

TL;DR: 本研究首次测量了英语使用者在前元音生成时发音空间中元音的最小可区分距离(JPD)，发现为14到51 mels。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类元音发音的控制机制，尤其是亚音素水平上的控制精度尚未明确。研究希望通过测量两个元音在听觉空间的最小可区分距离，为理解语言和发音系统提供理论基础。

Method: 采用元音模仿实验，测量两组英语使用者在发前元音时的最小可区分距离(JPD)，通过分析F1和F2声学空间中的距离估算JPD。

Result: 研究发现，两个不同元音刺激在F1 X F2空间中需要相距14到51 mels才能被可靠模仿和区分。

Conclusion: 研究结果为语音生成的情境理论提供支持，还为人类元音系统结构和可能出现的元音模式设定了理论下限及心理物理学解释。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

### [102] [Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778)
*Ken Tsui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在“自我纠正盲点”，缺乏纠正自身输出错误的能力。研究通过引入Self-Correction Bench框架测试发现，平均出现64.5%的盲点比率。适当触发机制可显著减少盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs具备变革性，但错误和无效推理路径限制了其可信度，需要研究如何提升它们的自我纠错能力。

Method: 构建了Self-Correction Bench框架，通过注入不同复杂程度的错误来测试模型，并分析14种模型的性能。同时探讨这些盲点与训练数据组成的关系。

Result: 发现LLMs的自我纠错盲点均值为64.5%，且与训练过程中的数据分布不平衡相关。简单的提示如“Wait”即可显著激发纠错能力，将盲点减少89.3%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLMs存在的重要局限性，并为提高其可靠性和可信度提出了可能的改进方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章研究了推理语言模型（RLMs）的偏见鲁棒性，发现具备推理能力的模型比基础模型更易受偏见引诱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理机制对语言模型偏见鲁棒性的影响，为偏见安全性设计提供依据。

Method: 使用CLEAR-Bias基准，结合LLM-as-a-judge评分和越狱技术，系统评估不同推理机制下模型的偏见鲁棒性。

Result: 具备推理能力的模型比基础模型对偏见更脆弱，基于CoT的模型尤为易受到情境化攻击。

Conclusion: 推理能力不一定改进模型偏见安全性，需要重新设计以应对偏见问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MathV-DP的数据集及基于Qwen-VL的模型Qwen-VL-DP，通过多样化的监督学习和规则强化学习方法，提升了多模态语言模型在数学推理上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态语言模型在数学推理中存在过于依赖一对一图文对及单一答案监督的问题，无法有效捕捉多样化的推理视角及内在反思机制。

Method: 引入MathV-DP数据集，该数据集包含每个图文问题对的多种解答路径。提出Qwen-VL-DP模型，通过监督学习和一种基于规则的强化学习方法（GRPO）进行优化，结合正确性判别与多样性奖励函数，强化模型的多样化推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，Qwen-VL-DP在MathVista's minitest和Math-V基准测试中，在准确性和生成多样性上均显著优于现有多模态语言模型。

Conclusion: 综合多样化推理视角及反思性推理机制是提升多模态数学推理能力的重要方法，Qwen-VL-DP验证了这一点并取得了良好的实验结果。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态路由框架SynapseRoute，用于在大语言模型的高成本推理模式和低成本快速模式中分配任务，从而优化精度、效率和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于大型语言模型在推理和快速模式之间的使用成本差异，本研究旨在通过动态路由方案优化高效和经济的计算资源分配，尤其在医学问题解答中。

Method: 本研究提出了一个基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，该框架根据任务复杂度将查询分配到“高推理”或“非推理”模式。

Result: 在医学数据集上的实验结果表明，SynapseRoute的整体准确率优于单独使用高推理模式（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），同时推理时间减少36.8%，令牌消耗下降39.66%。

Conclusion: 动态路由可以改善任务分配的效率和准确性，避免简单任务中过度推理的弊端，并引入了AIT评价指标以系统分析准确率、时延和成本之间的权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Conclusion: 通过新基准IFBench的引入和RLVR强化学习方法的应用，研究展示了提升语言模型精确指令遵循能力的可能性，并为未来的相关研究工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型偏好调整中潜在的安全性漏洞及其利用方法。

Method: 攻击者通过诱导语言模型随机生成“有毒”或普通响应，再通过上/下投票机制加强有毒响应，而后在偏好调整阶段影响模型行为。

Result: 验证了攻击能够成功地插入新知识、改变代码生成模式以引入安全漏洞以及注入虚假金融新闻。

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了偏好调整数据能实现精细化行为控制的特性，还揭示了一种针对语言模型的新型攻击机制。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

TL;DR: 本论文提出一种名为MOTIF的新型强化学习训练方法，以帮助大模型在多轮次中进行模块化思考，超越了上下文大小限制，提高了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型具有推理能力，但受限于上下文大小，无法处理任意长的推理任务。通过开发多轮模块化推理方法，可以突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 研究提出MOTIF（Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning）方法，通过强化学习细调模型以多轮生成推理内容，增加了模型可用的上下文信息量，从而提高复杂推理任务的表现。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上对Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct进行了参数高效微调，并在MATH500与AIME2024基准测试中取得了3.8%和3.3%的性能提升，同时仅使用了样本的15%。

Conclusion: 通过MOTIF方法，大语言模型在推理任务上的性能得到显著改进，并且具有样本效率高的优势，展示了其在复杂推理场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估主要利用多项选择题，因其客观易于自动化。但研究发现，多项选择题可被投机取巧，不需理解问题内容就能解答，暴露了评估方法的局限性。

Method: 研究中提出生成回答匹配参考答案的方法：首先让候选模型生成自由形式回答，然后利用现代语言模型判断生成答案是否与参考答案匹配。此外，构建并标注数据集MMLU-Pro和GPQA-Diamond，通过与人类评分结果的对比验证方法有效性。

Result: 研究发现，通过回答匹配进行评估的方法在与人类评分结果的一致性上接近完美，优于多项选择题和无需参考答案的评估方法，并且显著改变了一些模型的排名结果。

Conclusion: 生成回答匹配方法是一种更准确、可扩展的评估语言模型性能的方式，研究建议从多项选择逐步转变为该评估方式。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STELLA的自进化AI代理，通过多代理架构和自我改进机制提高在生物医学领域的研究能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学数据和工具的碎片化及传统人工智能代理无法自我扩展的问题。

Method: 通过多代理架构，利用自我演化模板库和动态工具库，其中工具发现代理负责整合新的生物信息学工具。

Result: 在多项生物医学基准测试中取得了最先进的表现，并且性能能够随经验增加显著提升。

Conclusion: STELLA实现了AI代理系统的动态自我改进与扩展，为加速生物医学领域的研究做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical

### [111] [HCVR: A Hybrid Approach with Correlation-aware Voting Rules for Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02073)
*Nikita Bhedasgaonkar,Rushikesh K. Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR:  本文提出了一种名为HCVR的轻量级基于规则的特征选择方法，通过结合P2P和P2T相关性来最小化冗余特征，同时保留相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特征选择方法在消除冗余特征且保留相关特征方面存在性能改进的需求。

Method: HCVR以贪婪方法为基础，结合非迭代和迭代过滤方法，通过相关性阈值和投票规则评估特征重要性，采用逐步消除方式去除可能冗余的特征。

Result: 应用于SPAMBASE数据集后，HCVR展示了相比传统非迭代（如CFS、mRMR和MI）及迭代技术（如RFE、SFS和遗传算法）更优的性能表现。

Conclusion: 提出的HCVR方法能够有效改进特征选择的效率与性能，适用于分类器性能优化的任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

Motivation: 进一步探索静态和动态设置下空间囚徒困境中合作形成机制，尤其是研究稀释与流动性的效果。

Method: 采用独立的多智能体Q学习算法，定义不同动作连接到以往经典研究，并测试稀释与流动性对囚徒困境游戏的影响。

Result: 观察到固定更新规则可能与学习规则等效，同时多动作定义可导致种群间共生互惠效应的形成。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了用强化学习算法模拟不同博弈场景的灵活性和可基准化潜力，以及固定规则和学习规则在某些条件下的可替代性。

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs推理效率低，简单问题过度计算，复杂问题却计算不足，因此需要更高效的推理计算策略。

Method: 提出两层分类法：L1-可控性操作在固定计算预算下，L2-适应性根据输入难度动态调整计算；并对领先的专有LLMs进行基准分析。

Result: 揭示了推理性能与Token使用间的重要权衡，并比以往综述更强调实际控制性和适应性。

Conclusion: 讨论新兴趋势如混合思维模型，未来需要提升LLMs的计算效率、鲁棒性及用户需求响应能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的湿实验室实验成本高昂，限制了大型语言模型在科学实验设计和分析能力测试中的应用，因此需要一种经济且有效的替代方法。

Method: 模拟生物系统并使用系统生物学标记语言（SBML）生成实验数据，构建了SciGym基准测试，评估了六个前沿LLMs在137个小规模系统上的表现，并最终发布了350个系统。

Result: 实验发现更先进的模型在性能上表现更优，但随着系统复杂度增加，所有模型的性能都显著下降，表明当前LLMs在科学实验能力上有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: SciGym为评估LLMs在科学实验中的能力提供了有效工具，但模型在应对复杂系统方面仍需提高，表明其在科学推理领域仍有较大的升级潜力。

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI模型训练过程昂贵、缓慢，且模型部署后参数固定，这种方式难以应对环境的动态变化。而神经科学中的动物行为展现了快速适应环境变化的能力，这种能力对于AI尤其在现实世界的操作中显得日益重要。

Method: 通过结合AI的持续学习、上下文学习文献与神经科学中涉及行为任务、规则变化及奖励变化任务的学习研究，提出双向交融的研究框架。

Conclusion: 神经科学的学习洞察能够改善AI的适应能力，而AI也能助力神经科学研究，推动各自领域及NeuroAI的共同发展。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

Method: 通过整合社会科学中审计研究的数据，作者评估了传统的基于重新采样的公平性干预方法，并结合个体处理效应估计方法提出了新的干预算法。

Result: 使用审计研究数据发现，基于传统度量标准的平等基数率干预方法实际上仍然存在约10%的差异，而新提出的个体处理效应估计方法显著减少了算法歧视。

Conclusion: 审计研究数据是改善算法公平性的重要资源，新干预方法表明可以更准确地减少AI决策中的歧视问题。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Motivation: 探索如何通过数据多样化的偏好优化策略，提升大语言模型在数学推理任务中的表现，以解决其对复杂数学逻辑推理能力欠缺的问题。

Method: 研究常见的数据生成方法（温度采样、链式思维提示、蒙特卡洛树搜索）并提出DTS（Diversified-ThinkSolve），通过系统性地将问题分解为多样化的推理路径，生成多样性的偏好数据。

Result: DTS方法在GSM8K和MATH数据集上的表现分别相较于基线提升了7.1%和4.2%，且计算成本仅是基线的1.03倍。相比之下，MCTS虽成本更高（接近5倍），但增益更低。

Conclusion: 与传统方法相比，结构化探索多样化问题解决方法能够生成更有效的偏好数据，从而更好地实现数学任务的对齐和性能提升。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何确保大语言模型（LLMs）在扮演角色生成人的行为研究合成数据时保持输出一致性。研究揭示LLMs的陈述信念与行为之间存在系统性不一致性，对研究人员有效使用其进行行为研究提出挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs被用于扮演角色生成行为研究数据，确保它们的输出与设定的角色一致成为关键课题。

Method: 本文构建了一种评价框架，通过增强版GenAgents角色库和信任博弈等方法进行系统性研究，包括提出信念-行为一致性指标，并考察不同因素对一致性的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，LLMs的陈述信念（包括预期模拟结果和角色属性）与实际仿真行为存在系统性不一致，并且即使模型具有看似合理的信念，也可能无法一致地应用。

Conclusion: 研究强调有必要识别LLMs的信念何时与行为一致，从而指导研究者在行为研究中正确使用基于LLMs的代理模型。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Motivation: 现有提升LLM规划和推理能力的研究受限于可扩展且可靠的数据生成和评估瓶颈。该研究旨在解决这一问题，为复杂问题提供动态解决方案。

Method: 引入了一个名为NL2FLOW的系统，该系统以自然语言、结构化中间表示和形式化PDDL生成规划问题，并严格评估生成计划的质量。同时，通过回归分析考察问题特性对计划生成的影响。

Result: NL2FLOW生成了2296个规划问题，对多种开源LLM进行了评估。最佳模型的有效计划生成率为86%，最优计划生成率为69%。研究表明，直接从自然语言生成计划优于通过中间转换步骤的方式。

Conclusion: 不必要的分解推理任务可能会降低系统性能。为了应对复杂问题，需要对限制有动态理解，并开发揭示限制的工具，从而提升LLM智能问题求解的潜力。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

Conclusion: 不同修正机制在实现特定信念状态方面具有独特能力，这些能力为其在特定应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

Conclusion: OMS提供了一种无需训练数据即可在多目标条件下智能生成关键词的解决方案，对广告投放的效果与效率提升具有重要意义。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score

success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

Abstract: AI research agents are demonstrating great potential to accelerate scientific
progress by automating the design, implementation, and training of machine
learning models. We focus on methods for improving agents' performance on
MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result
on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly
considering the search strategy, operator design, and evaluation methodology in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI框架主要关注单轮任务，与现实中不确定性和互动性的诊断过程存在差距；需开发更符合实际医疗环境的模拟平台和方法。

Method: 设计MIMIC-Patient数据集以支持动态患者模拟，提出DynamiCare框架模拟多轮互动的诊断过程，其中包括多个专科智能体的迭代查询和信息整合。

Result: 通过实验验证了DynamiCare框架的可行性与有效性，并建立了动态临床决策的首个基准。

Conclusion: 本文工作展示了动态多智能体方法在复杂临床决策中的潜力，为未来医疗AI的开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文使用迭代囚徒困境(IPD)研究大型语言模型(LLMs)在竞争环境下的推理和决策。通过与经典策略和主流AI模型的对比，展示了LLMs在复杂环境中的策略表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够在竞争环境下进行目标推理和策略决策。IPD长期以来一直是研究决策制定的经典模型。

Method: 通过变更终止概率，设置复杂多样的IPD进化对抗赛；分析LLMs与经典算法（如Tit-for-Tat）及三个主流AI公司的模型之间的表现与行为特性。

Result: LLMs在复杂对抗环境中表现出竞争力，显示出持续的“战略指纹”，如Google模型表现策略冷酷，OpenAI模型极度合作但在敌对环境下表现不佳，Anthropic模型最具宽容性，倾向于恢复合作。

Conclusion: LLMs能够进行时间和对手战略推理，其推理对决策有直接作用，研究连接了经典博弈论和机器心理学，为算法决策提供了深入视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG管道在处理复杂信息需求时有局限性。现有推理方法将高层规划与详细执行结合在一起，造成效率低下和可扩展性受限。

Method: 引入HiRA框架，将复杂搜索任务分解成子任务，利用领域特定的agent和外部工具分别执行并整合，通过分离规划和执行实现高效推理。

Result: HiRA在四个复杂跨模态深度搜索基准上显著超越了当前最先进的RAG和基于agent的系统，在回答质量和系统效率上均有改进。

Conclusion: HiRA框架通过将规划和执行分离，为多步信息搜索任务提供了一种更高效可扩展的方法，可提升复杂搜索场景下的表现。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Think-How-to-Think (TH2T)的新两阶段微调策略，用于启发长推理模型(LRM)的难度认知和冗余认知，以缓解过度思考现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长推理模型在处理复杂推理任务时表现出色，但由于无法区分任务的难度级别而导致过度思考现象。本文旨在探索如何通过提升模型的认知能力解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TH2T两阶段微调策略：第一阶段通过在模型输出前缀引入难度催眠(difficulty-hypnosis)并结合异构短长推理数据集，让模型增强对任务难度的感知能力；第二阶段通过对推理过程引入冗余催眠(redundancy-hypnosis)，指导模型识别冗余结构并生成更简洁的推理结果。

Result: 实验证明，在7B/14B/32B模型上，TH2T能够显著减少推理成本（容易任务减少70%以上，困难任务减少40%），同时保持性能稳定。得到的输出表现出清晰的难度感知能力和减少的冗余。

Conclusion: TH2T策略有效缓解了长推理模型的过度思考问题，通过提升对任务难度和冗余的认知，显著提升推理效率并简化推理输出。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程教育中，学生的任务脱离可能导致学术辍学，这需要设计有效的干预以减少学习脱离。

Method: 通过Moodle平台记录的学生行为日志，使用八种机器学习算法进行了训练与比较，并使用SHAP方法建立可解释性框架，以分析算法决策。

Result: 实验结果显示模型的平衡准确率为91%，其中正确检测到约85%的学习脱离学生。

Conclusion: 本研究表明基于可解释机器学习的框架有效且可以应用于设计及时干预，从而减少在线学习中非强制性任务的任务脱离现象。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非精确抽象方法会导致误差，使得在抽象空间中无法收敛到最优决策。因此需要开发新的抽象丢弃方法以改进算法性能。

Method: 提出了两种新的抽象丢弃方法：OGA-IAAD和OGA-CAD，前者针对时间紧迫的场景设计，后者致力于提高相同迭代次数下的性能。

Result: 新提出的方法在不同场景下显著提升了MCTS性能，且未引起任何显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 两个新方法实现了安全、有效的抽象丢弃，在性能及可靠性方面比现有方法更优。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在自动定理证明中因稀疏奖励和巨大规模推理困难的问题，特别是在大学水平的PutnamBench挑战中。

Method: 引入了自生成目标导向MDPs（sG-MDPs）框架，通过演化的证明状态生成子目标，并使用类似蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）的算法解决sG-MDP。此外，开发了Bourbaki(7B)模块化系统，实现了多种7B LLM模型的协作生成子目标和策略合成。

Result: 在PutnamBench测试中，Bourbaki(7B)解决了26个问题，更新了此模型规模下的技术领先成果。

Conclusion: 通过创新框架和系统，证明了生成子目标和利用搜索方法可以有效提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Method: 通过知识协议工程，系统性地将人类专家的知识翻译为机器可执行的知识协议（KP），并使之内化领域的逻辑和操作策略。

Result: KPE能够使通用大型语言模型以专家的逻辑，分解抽象的查询并执行复杂的多步骤任务。

Conclusion: KPE构建了一种新的方法论，赋予通用LLM领域专家的能力，是未来人机协作的基础方法学。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: 运动不只是结果，而是了解智能系统互动世界的窗口。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Result: 实验结果表明，KERAP有效提升了诊断预测的可靠性，并且适用于零样本条件下的医疗诊断预测。

Conclusion: KERAP为医疗诊断预测提供了一种可扩展且可解释的解决方案，克服了传统模型和大语言模型的不足。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Motivation: 随着AI日益智能化，现有着重于命令式服从的安全方法已难应对其在伦理推理和处理道德困境上的需求，导致潜在误解和治理问题。

Method: 通过哲学关于工具理性、道德责任和目标修订的辩论，分析AI行为学的风险与新兴框架对比，并实例讨论AI在多元伦理框架下的表现情况。

Conclusion: AI安全评估需从僵化的服从转向考察伦理判断，以正确评估AI行为，提高公众信任，促进有效治理。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Result: 通过在复杂的CVE-Bench中应用ABC，性能高估减少了33%。

Conclusion: Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC)可以显著提高代理性基准测试的严谨性，减少性能评估的不准确性。

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

### [140] [StepHint: Multi-level Stepwise Hints Enhance Reinforcement Learning to Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02841)
*Kaiyi Zhang,Ang Lv,Jinpeng Li,Yongbo Wang,Feng Wang,Haoyuan Hu,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出StepHint算法，通过引入分步提示解决RLVR中的小失误奖励问题和探索停滞问题，显著提升训练效率和模型推理能力，在数学基准和跨域评估中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前RLVR方法在LLM中的应用面临小失误奖励问题和探索停滞问题，导致训练效率低和模型局限性大。

Method: StepHint算法利用多层次分步提示，从更强大的模型生成有效推理链，并通过自适应分区将其分解为推理步骤，为模型提供逐步提示，引导其探索更具潜力的解决方案空间，同时保留独立探索的灵活性。

Result: 实验表明，StepHint在六个数学基准上超过现有方法，在跨域基准上呈现更强的泛化能力和优异的表现。

Conclusion: 引入分步提示的StepHint算法有效缓解了RLVR方法中的核心问题，显著提升了大语言模型的推理能力和探索效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

### [141] [Learnable-Differentiable Finite Volume Solver for Accelerated Simulation of Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01975)
*Mengtao Yan,Qi Wang,Haining Wang,Ruizhi Chengze,Yi Zhang,Hongsheng Liu,Zidong Wang,Fan Yu,Qi Qi,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种名为LDSolver的可学习和可微分有限体积求解器，用于在粗网格上高效而准确地模拟流体流动，实验结果优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数值求解器计算成本高，而机器学习方法存在可解释性、泛化性和数据依赖性的问题，因此需要一种新方法改进流体流动模拟。

Method: LDSolver结合了可微分的有限体积求解器和一个可学习模块，用于提供通量的等效近似，并进行时间误差修正。

Result: LDSolver在不同流动系统上的实验表明，其性能优于基线模型，并具有卓越的精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: LDSolver能够在有限的训练数据下，加速流体流动模拟的同时保持高精度，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Conclusion: 该方法为无校准且具有通用性运动想象分类设立了新的基准，同时贡献了一个可靠的公开数据集促进领域研究。

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Result: 在真实半导体FAB过程时间序列数据集上，方法表现出高效离线异常检测能力，确保异常能被精确识别。

Conclusion: 所提方法灵活适应监督和半监督场景，为复杂生产环境提供了一种高效、通用的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Chain of Thought（TCOT），通过选择视频中最相关的帧来提升长视频问答的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型（VLMs）仍然面临处理长视频时的困难，尤其是在有效利用长序列和去除干扰项方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出一种名为Temporal Chain of Thought的推理策略，通过迭代方式由VLM自身识别并提取视频中最相关的帧，用于问题的回答。

Result: 在4个不同的视频问答数据集上实现了最新的性能表现。在超过一个小时的视频数据上，其方法在使用32K的上下文窗口时，比正常使用700K上下文窗口的模型提升了2.8个点。

Conclusion: 通过推理阶段更高效的上下文选择和计算分配，TCOT策略可以显著改善长视频的理解效果，特别是在视频长度超出模型上下文窗口时。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出AIRES，通过算法-系统协同设计加速GCNs的稀疏矩阵乘法，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏矩阵乘法是GCNs建模的关键。然而，随着图数据规模的扩大，现有系统内存不足，需要依赖内外存储交换。但现有方法在I/O延迟和GPU利用率上存在不足。

Method: AIRES从算法层面优化稀疏格式的数据对齐与分块，从系统层面采用动态调度和层级存储策略，减少I/O延迟并提升吞吐量。

Result: 在真实世界的图处理测试中，AIRES相比现有方法延迟降低了最高1.8倍。

Conclusion: AIRES通过创新设计显著提升了GCNs稀疏矩阵乘法性能，解决了内外存储数据交换及GPU资源利用的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前几何扩散模型在分子动力学和结构生成的应用中表现卓越，但如何在多种几何控制条件下高效微调模型仍是未解决的问题。

Method: 提出GeoAda框架，利用控制信号编码、预训练模型层副本处理及等变投影等步骤，通过仅微调适配器模块实现参数高效的几何控制生成任务微调，同时保持SE(3)-等变特性。

Result: GeoAda在多种几何控制任务和领域上都表现出色，如粒子动力学、分子动力学、人体运动预测和分子生成，且有效避免了过拟合和灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GeoAda框架不仅可以实现灵活高效的微调，还能够保持模型原有的几何一致性和任务精度，相较于其它基线方法在微调性能上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: 研究比较了多种大型语言模型与专注招聘的模型Match Score在招聘匹配任务中的表现，发现Match Score在预测准确性和公平性上均优于通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在招聘任务中的表现，特别是其在准确性和公平性上的潜力和限制。

Method: 对多个主流大型语言模型和一个专注招聘的模型Match Score进行比较，评估它们在10,000个真实候选人-职位对上的准确性（例如ROC AUC）和公平性（基于性别、种族等维度）。

Result: Match Score在准确性和公平性上均明显优于通用的大型语言模型。例如，Match Score的ROC AUC达0.85，而最佳LLM仅为0.77。同时，其种族影响比率接近0.957，远高于LLM的0.809。

Conclusion: 在招聘等高风险应用中，通用大型语言模型难以兼顾准确性和公平性，而专门设计的模型可以更好地平衡这两者。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Motivation: 解决CMDP中预期累积奖励最大化与累积约束条件之间的平衡问题，确保提供逼近最优策略的高效算法。

Method: 构建基于原对偶框架的算法，结合任意黑箱无约束MDP求解器，并以镜像下降值迭代算法为实例，分别分析在允许松弛与严格可行性条件下的样本复杂度。

Result: 在松弛可行性条件下，算法以$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$的样本复杂度实现$\epsilon$-逼近最优解；在严格可行性条件下，样本复杂度为$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$。

Conclusion: 该研究框架不仅适用于线性CMDP，也可扩展到表格CMDP，提供了在不同情境下接近最优的样本复杂度结果。

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了能统一“System 2 Thinking”推理技巧的新方法，采用Energy-Based Transformers（EBTs）实现多模态和优化性能的兼顾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有推理技术面临的特定模态、特定问题或需要额外监督的问题，提出一种可以在无监督学习下开发出能够进行通用“System 2 Thinking”的模型。

Method: 通过学习验证输入与候选预测的兼容性，训练一种新的能量模型（Energy-Based Models），即Energy-Based Transformers（EBTs），通过梯度下降的能量最小化进行预测。

Result: 在文本和视觉模态下，EBTs在数据扩展上优于主流方法，训练效率提升最高35%，推理性能增强29%，表现优于现有模型，同时减少了计算负担。

Conclusion: EBTs为扩展模型学习与推理能力提供了一个有前景的新范式，展现了较好的通用性与性能提升。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Abstract: We introduce PANAMA, an active learning framework for the training of
end-to-end parametric guitar amp models using a WaveNet-like architecture. With
\model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples that are determined
by an active learning strategy to use a minimum amount of datapoints (i.e., amp
knob settings). We show that gradient-based optimization algorithms can be used
to determine the optimal datapoints to sample, and that the approach helps
under a constrained number of samples.

Motivation: 探究在模型规模和训练时间共同增长的情况下，控制神经网络训练动力学的标度极限，以及如何通过模型的计算优化和统一曲线表示寻找更好的训练参数。

Method: 通过对不同大小的模型进行训练，并在训练计算量和损失归一化的情况下对其结果进行分析；结合学习率衰减和随机梯度下降(SGD)的噪声动力学模型，预测和解释损失曲线及超级重叠现象的起源。

Result: 研究发现，当训练计算量和损失归一化后，不同规模模型的损失曲线可以紧密重叠，特别是在学习率衰减条件下，这种超重叠现象非常显著；此外，在超参数未被优化时，这种现象会遭到破坏，这可以用来作为评估最佳缩放的实践指标。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在神经网络训练中，通过归一化损失曲线分析可以揭示普适性的标度规律，通过超级重叠现象定义了良好训练的标志，并提出了可以定量解释这些现象的简单有效的理论模型。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Motivation: 现有集成电路设计的复杂性使得参数空间巨大，而传统手动选择参数方式费时费力且依赖专家经验，无法高效应对。

Method: CROP框架核心包括三个方面：1. 可扩展的方法将RTL源代码转化为密集的向量表示；2. 基于嵌入的检索系统，用于匹配语义上相似的设计电路；3. 基于RAG增强的大型语言模型，用先前设计知识约束参数搜索。

Result: 实验表明，CROP在工业设计中实现了更少迭代次数以达到更高的结果质量（QoR），如功耗减少9.9%。

Conclusion: CROP通过自动化和智能化手段优化VLSI设计流程，显著提升设计效率和质量，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效潜在扩散框架，通过结合变分自编码器和条件扩散模型，实现了数据压缩和条件生成的突破性改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在条件情境下表现强大，但受控性和重构精度的不足限制了它们在数据压缩中的实际应用。

Method: 结合变分自编码器与条件扩散模型，仅对少量关键帧进行潜在空间压缩，利用生成式插值重构其他帧，从而减少储存每帧潜在表示的需求。

Result: 实验表明，与现有先进算法相比，该方法在相同重建误差下提升了最高10倍的压缩比，性能提升达63%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架实现了准确的时空重构，同时显著降低了存储成本，展现出卓越的潜力。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional
settings and can be viewed as a form of data compression, where the condition
serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Result: 在多种真实动态图数据集上验证，NCPNET在WIKI数据集上预测集规模减少31%，大幅提升效率且保障覆盖率。

Conclusion: NCPNET有效应对动态图中的时间依赖性问题，确保覆盖率并大幅提升预测效率。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的维度归约评价中，由于选择高度相关的指标可能导致偏差，从而造成对某些特定DR技术的不公平偏好。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了DR评价的稳定性，有助于缓解评价中的偏差。

Conclusion: 本文的工作流程为更公平和可靠的维度归约投影评价提供了新途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

Result: 在三种典型PDE系统（Navier-Stokes流体动力学、波动方程和混沌Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程）中，PhysicsCorrect将预测误差减少最高可达100倍，推理时间增加不到5%。

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect框架可以无缝集成到多种神经网络架构中，将不稳定的神经网络代理转变为可靠的模拟工具，实现计算效率和物理精度的出色平衡。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何生成模型之间的细粒度对比文档，即使面对的模型规模巨大。提出了名为VERBA的方法，利用大型语言模型生成对模型差异的表述，并通过评估协议验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习领域，任务中可能存在多个表现相似但行为不同的训练模型。为帮助用户分析选择并提高模型透明性，需要自动化的方式生成模型对比文档。

Method: 提出VERBA方法，利用大型语言模型，从比较的两模型中抽样生成描述差异的文本。此外，作者建立了评估协议来测试生成文本的有效信息性，同时组装了一个多样机器学习模型数据集进行实验。

Result: 在两决策树模型性能差异达5%（行为差异达20-25%）的情况下，VERBA生成的差异描述准确率达80%；加入模型结构信息后，准确率提升至90%。

Conclusion: VERBA方法为模型后处理中的透明度和可比性提升提供了新方向，证明了其生成高准确度文本的能力。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种市场条件下均优于基线方法，有效提升补贴策略的表现。

Conclusion: FCA-RL具有动态应变和预算优化能力，可为网约车服务提供商带来更优化的补贴策略。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统奖励函数设计方法效率低且不一致，该研究旨在解决相关挑战，并利用大语言模型自动化奖励函数设计。

Method: 提出URDP框架，通过自一致性分析量化奖励函数不确定性，发现无效或新颖的奖励成分，并引入不确定性感知贝叶斯优化(UABO)提升超参数配置效率，同时采用两级优化架构分离奖励成分优化和超参数调整。

Result: 在35个任务的广泛实验中，URDP生成了更高质量的奖励函数并显著提升了自动化奖励设计效率。

Conclusion: URDP成功整合大语言模型逻辑推理能力与贝叶斯优化数值优化优势，是一种更高效且高质的奖励函数设计方法。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合知识图谱和零样本学习，有效提升了语义通信对动态和资源受限环境的适应能力。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

TL;DR: 提出了AMR框架，用于应对非静态连续学习问题中的概念漂移，能有效平衡模型的稳定性与适应性，并引入了概念漂移基准数据集进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设任务数据分布固定，但在现实中数据流常伴随概念漂移，需提出方法解决这种动态环境下的稳定性及适应性问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为自适应内存重排（AMR）的机制，通过从记忆库中移除过时样本并添加少量更新样本来适应概念漂移。另外，构建了四个概念漂移版本的标准视觉基准数据集用于评估。

Result: 实验表明，AMR在多个概念漂移数据集上能够有效应对变化，维持高准确度并显著减少标注数据与计算开销。

Conclusion: AMR是一种高效且可扩展的方法，在处理连续学习中的非平稳问题时，能够很好地平衡模型的稳定性与可塑性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

TL;DR: 研究提出DeltaSHAP算法，用于在线患者监控系统的可解释性，改进了时间序列解释方法并提升了可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法无法满足临床时间序列解释任务的要求，难以有效发现患者风险变化的驱动因素，影响及时干预。

Method: 通过调整Shapley值以适应时间序列情境，DeltaSHAP能够解释连续预测值的变化，提供特征归因的大小及方向，并在实时中实现高效计算。

Result: DeltaSHAP在在线患者监控任务中表现出色，在MIMIC-III基准测试上提升了解释质量（62%）并降低了计算时间（33%）。

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP提供了适用于实时临床应用的高效、准确的时间序列解释方法，显著优于现有XAI方法。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code
at https://github.com/AITRICS/DeltaSHAP.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，S2FGL框架具有优越性。

Conclusion: S2FGL框架在解决联邦图学习中空间与频谱问题上表现出色，并提供了代码实现供研究者使用。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Method: 将基函数数量的选择转化为训练过程中的变分推断优化问题，并设计了名为InfinityKAN的框架。

Result: 该方法通过加入可调的基函数数量显著提升了Kolmogorov Arnold网络的适用性。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN为Kolmogorov Arnold 网络提供了更优的表示能力，同时简化了超参数选择。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

TL;DR: GORP是一种培训策略，通过整合完整和低秩参数及其梯度更新，解决大语言模型在持续学习中的效率与表达能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩适配方法如LoRA在模型学习新任务和知识迁移时存在局限性，其低秩特性和参数约束导致这一问题。

Method: 提出GORP策略,综合利用完整与低秩参数，并在一个统一的低秩梯度子空间中共同优化更新。

Result: 实验表明，GORP在持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有最新方法。

Conclusion: GORP提供了一种通过扩展优化空间，且在保持效率和减少遗忘的同时，提高持续学习性能的方法。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猜测解码方法需要定制化的小型草案模型，然而在线部署面临模型不兼容及延迟优化挑战。

Method: 引入在线n-gram缓存和混合蒸馏微调技术以解决跨词汇问题，并通过自适应草案技术提升解码速度。

Result: 验证了OmniDraft框架在数学推理、编码及文本生成任务的在线学习效果，并实现了单一草案模型对多种目标模型的适配，同时解码速度提升1.5-2倍。

Conclusion: OmniDraft框架为在设备上的大语言模型应用提供了一种高效、经济且兼具用户定制化能力的解方案，推动了“统一草案模型”范式的发展。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多基于黑箱语言模型，缺少针对SQL生成的专用模型研究，而自纠正策略潜力尚未在文本到SQL任务中探索。

Method: 通过为SQL查询准备推理步骤并引入错误生成'重试数据'，在开源编码模型上进行持续预训练，同时进行实验验证。

Result: 利用RetrySQL数据预训练可显著提高准确性指标达4个百分点。同时验证了LoRA微调方法无效，全参数预训练是必要的。

Conclusion: 自纠正能力可以在文本到SQL任务中习得，RetrySQL为改进SQL语言模型生成精度提供了一种创新途径，与参数量远大于自身的专有模型在执行精度上具有竞争力。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Conclusion: ExPO方法通过生成策略一致且高质量的正样本显著改进了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，为强化学习后训练提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Result: 指出这种组合稀疏性不仅存在于当前所有学习问题，还可能与所有有效图灵可计算函数相关。

Conclusion: 完全理解组合稀疏性在深度学习中的作用对人工智能广泛理论的形成至关重要。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了移除GPT-2模型中的层归一化层（LN）对模型性能和可解释性的影响，发现移除LN后模型性能仅有轻微下降，可解释性有所改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在研究层归一化在推理阶段的作用，以及探索通过移除LN层改进大型语言模型的机械可解释性。

Method: 通过逐层移除GPT-2模型中的LN层进行实验，并细化模型性能与训练需求的分析，同时测试LN移除后对可解释性的影响。

Result: 在移除LN后，GPT-2模型验证损失仅轻微增加，训练需要的微调数据随模型大小亚线性增长，可扩展性良好。此外，LN移除后对直接归因和神经元激活影响进行了详尽分析。

Conclusion: GPT-2模型可以在没有LN层的情况下正常运行，LN层并非语言建模的核心模块。移除LN层可以改善对模型机制的理解和解释。

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高DBNs在资源受限硬件上的推断效率，同时实现其扩展到更宽层面。

Method: 引入了一种参数计数不随输入宽度增长的可微分互连机制，并设计了基于SAT逻辑等价和相似性的数据驱动剪枝方法。

Result: DBNs能够扩展到更宽的层，同时通过剪枝技术显著减少了模型大小并优化了压缩精度权衡关系。

Conclusion: 提出的技术提高了DBNs的效率和扩展性，剪枝方法提供了更好的压缩性能。

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

TL;DR: 该论文研究是否可以通过在自编码器的潜空间中而非像素空间生成数据，以减小扩散模型在推理时的计算成本。实验发现潜空间的模拟精度在极高的压缩率下仍然具有鲁棒性，并且扩散模型优于非生成性模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因其高计算成本限制了其作为快速物理仿真器的应用，解决这一问题的动机是通过潜空间实现高效模拟。

Method: 通过对比实验，研究在自编码器潜空间中使用扩散模型进行动态系统仿真，并探讨各种设计选择的影响。

Result: 潜空间模拟方法在高达1000倍的压缩比下仍表现出高精度；扩散模型比非生成模型更准确，并可通过多样性弥补预测不确定性。

Conclusion: 在潜空间中使用扩散模型进行仿真是可行的，既提高效率又保证精度。

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

*Hazal Mogultay Ozcan,Sinan Kalkan,Fatos T. Yarman-Vural*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L-VAE是一种新型模型，能同时学习分离表征和损失函数超参数，解决了η-VAE的局限性，在多项数据集上表现优于同类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决η-VAE对超参数手动调整导致的局限性，并提升在分离表征和重构准确性之间的平衡能力。

Method: 提出L-VAE模型，能学得损失函数各项的权重以及模型参数，同时引入额外正则化项以防偏向于重构或分离表征中的某一端。

Result: 实验通过dSprites、MPI3D-complex等多数据集评估，表明L-VAE在分离表征指标上表现最佳或次优，同时在CelebA数据集上也能有效分离面部属性。

Conclusion: L-VAE通过学习权重和优化正则化项，在分离表征与重构之间取得高效平衡，提升了超参数调节的自动化水平及性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 设计了一种基于Transformer的矩阵变分自动编码器（matVAE），通过评估其在药物相关蛋白变异预测中的性能，展示了它对现有方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的变异效应预测器通常依赖MSA方法，但药物基因组学中某些基因的演化压力较低，传统假设不完全成立，因此引入DMS数据以提供更量化的适应性评分。

Method: 提出一种基于Transformer的matVAE模型，并评估其在33个DMS数据集上的性能；同时比较其在MSA和DMS数据集上的表现，探讨结合AlphaFold结构信息对预测效果的影响。

Result: matVAE模型在零样本预测中超越了现有的DeepSequence模型，且参数更少、计算效率更高；结合AlphaFold结构信息后，其性能接近于MSA基础上的DeepSequence。此外，matENC-DMS模型在有监督任务上表现更优。

Conclusion: DMS数据在变异效应预测中的潜力显著，未来可进一步开发与探索DMS数据集与其他数据的综合利用。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Medical Data Pecking的方法，用于改进电子健康记录数据（EHRs）的质量评估过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EHR数据广泛用于流行病学研究和人工智能训练，但常因数据质量问题影响研究结果的可靠性，需要系统性的评估方法来确定数据是否适合研究。

Method: 引入Medical Data Pecking方法，借鉴软件工程中的单元测试与覆盖概念，开发了Medical Data Pecking Tool（MDPT），通过大语言模型生成测试用例，并利用数据测试框架检测数据质量问题。

Result: 在AoU、MIMIC-III和SyntheticMass三个数据集中测试，生成了每组数据55-73个测试，发现20-43个不对齐或不符合规范的问题，并具体分析了测试集的参考基础和数值准确性。

Conclusion: 通过结合外部医学知识，MDPT提升了上下文敏感的数据质量测试能力，为更广泛的数据模式和改进的基础方法提供了发展基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破仅限于人类生成数据的机器学习训练束缚，探索通过自主生成任务与解决方案来推进通用人工智能。

Method: 利用生成机制创建虚拟任务，通过元学习器的约束区域迭代细化，基于范畴理论建模学习过程并推广到高层次问题概括，形成层次化、可解释的学习结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为元学习提供了统一视角，提出了通向通用人工智能的设计原则，可能推动神经网络进入自主生成任务与解决方案的下一阶段。

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 针对强化学习中数据效率低的问题，研究如何通过信息论方法实现高效的内在动机驱动探索。

Method: 提出了基于知识不确定性的奖励机制，并结合稀疏变分高斯过程、深核方法和深度集合模型，形成PTS-BE框架，实现信息增益导向的探索规划。

Result: PTS-BE框架在稀疏奖励与探索任务中表现优越，显著优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: PTS-BE框架提供了理论和实践上的可行性，为强化学习的深度探索问题提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法在应对未知操作泛化性和群体公平性之间存在冲突，需要解决这一关键问题。

Method: 提出了DAID框架，其由两部分组成：1) 面向人口统计的重新平衡，通过逆倾向加权和子组特征归一化中和分布偏差；2) 面向人口统计的特征聚合，通过新型对齐损失抑制敏感属性信号。

Result: 通过三个跨域基准测试验证，DAID在公平性和泛化性上均优于多种先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架具有坚实的理论基础和实际有效性，同时优化了深度伪造检测中的两个关键挑战——公平性和泛化性。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

Conclusion: 本文方法在确保差分隐私的同时提高了模型性能，为实现隐私友好的跨任务学习提供了一种新范例。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ERP系统多采用静态的规则方法，忽视了市场参与者间的战略交互。本研究旨在填补这一空白，研究MARL算法在供应链动态定价中的应用。

Method: 在一个基于真实电商交易数据的模拟环境中，评估了MADDPG、MADQN和QMIX三种MARL算法与传统规则基线之间的表现。模型采用LightGBM预测需求。

Result: 规则基准方法表现出近乎完美的公平性（Jain's Index: 0.9896）和最高价格稳定性（波动率: 0.024），但缺乏竞争动态性。MARL中，MADQN最具攻击性（最低公平性：0.5844），MADDPG兼具竞争性（份额波动: 9.5pp）和相对较高的公平性（0.8819）。

Conclusion: MARL算法能展现静态定价规则无法捕捉的战略行为特性，未来动态定价策略研发可以从中受益。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Result: 粘性保留民主协议性能优于传统方法，同时减少了对抗者的影响和传输成本。

Conclusion: 改进的协议和算法实现了更高效、安全和成本优化的联邦学习机制。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

Motivation: 现有的深度强化学习方法因存储在重放缓冲区的早期经验过度拟合而受限于样本效率和泛化能力，与人类记忆机制对比发现这一问题。

Conclusion: FoG证明了一种以神经科学为启发的创新方法，在强化学习中提升了样本效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HIPPO的分层对比学习框架，用于跨物种的蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPI）预测，并在现有数据集上表现卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI科学发展展示了对比学习在连接异构生物数据模态中的潜力，亟需改进PPI预测的问题，尤其是在低数据和跨物种环境中。

Method: 采用分层对比学习框架HIPPO，通过多层次生物表示匹配将蛋白质序列与其分层属性对齐，设计了分层对比损失函数以模拟蛋白质功能类之间的结构关系，同时引入了自适应惩罚机制以结合领域和家庭知识。

Result: HIPPO在基准数据集上表现出色，超越现有方法；其鲁棒性能在低数据环境中表现尤为突出。此外，该模型展示了在未训练物种中的零样本迁移能力，显著提升了在实验数据有限的生物体中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: HIPPO框架通过分层特征融合，在捕捉互动决定因素上（如结合位点和功能注释）显示关键作用，为跨物种PPI预测和稀疏或不平衡数据场景提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何通过超平面分离特征向量分类的问题，并考虑到此问题在机器学习领域的核心地位。

Method: 提出基于熵最小化的参数搜索方法，在N维超立方体内寻找分离超平面，同时考量扩展到更复杂多项式决策边界的可能性。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在处理多样化的分类任务（包括线性和非线性可分问题）中表现出高效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统优化技术如支持向量机和梯度下降提供了一个鲁棒的替代方案，特别适合解决复杂分类边界问题。

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

TL;DR: 本文分析了2-simplicial Transformer架构如何通过优化token效率在特定任务中超越标准Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型依赖互联网规模数据集，假设模型是计算受限的已不再完全成立，因此需要在架构设计中优先考虑token效率。

Method: 提出了2-simplicial Transformer架构，通过一个高效的Triton内核实现，将标准点积注意力扩展为三线性函数，并分析其在多种任务中的表现。

Result: 在相同token预算下，2-simplicial Transformer在数学、编码、推理及逻辑任务中优于标准Transformer，且在知识与推理任务的缩放规律中表现出不同的指数。

Conclusion: 该架构提高了token效率，显示出相比传统方法潜在的性能优势，为构建更高效的大型语言模型提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在离线数据存在偏差的情况下如何高效解决在线定价问题，以及如何利用偏差数据减少在线学习的损失。

Method: 定义实例相关量$\delta^2$衡量离线数据与在线最优之间的距离。采用乐观-不确定性理论（OFU）方法，并在已知和未知偏差界情况下提出通用和鲁棒算法。

Result: 提出的OFU策略达到了偏实例且最优的后悔上界$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$，并首次给出了在偏差离线数据下的严格理论保证。技术成果也适用于带偏差离线数据的随机线性带宽问题，获得类似的结果。

Conclusion: 论文为带偏差离线数据的情境在线定价提供了首个严格的后悔保证，并提出了鲁棒方法，在偏差较小时优于纯在线算法，扩展了理论和实际应用前景。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

TL;DR: 探讨递归模型在训练上下文长度之外的表现问题，并提出简单的训练干预措施以增强长度泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于递归模型在处理序列长度方面的复杂度低，且理论上能处理任意长序列，然而其性能在训练上下文长度之外可能大幅下降。本研究试图探明为何会出现这样的长度泛化问题。

Method: 提出未探索状态假设，通过综合实证和理论分析支持这些假设，同时设计简单的训练干预措施，例如用高斯噪声初始化状态或用其他输入序列的最终状态进行初始化。

Result: 在仅约0.1%的后训练预算下，这些干预措施在序列长度极大超出的训练上下文下实现了长度泛化（如从2k延展到128k），并在长上下文任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 简单高效的训练干预方法可以显著提高递归模型的长度泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Motivation: 现有生存分析模型主要校准于总体水平，常忽视子群体的校准，可能导致少数群体预测不准确，从而影响临床决策。

Method: 提出GRADUATE模型，利用约束优化框架，将多重校准作为优化目标，同时在训练中平衡校准和区分能力，提供理论证明模型的最优和可行性。

Result: 通过实际临床数据验证，该模型表现优于现有方法，并探讨现有基准模型的弱点与GRADUATE的优势。

Conclusion: GRADUATE能有效提升生存模型的全群体和子群体校准能力，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

Conclusion: 该研究为基于文本的个性化医疗决策提供了一个有效的偏差缓解方法。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Result: 在三组fMRI测试数据上取得了最新的状态性能，显著优于包括超图方法在内的已有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的MvHo-IB框架有效提取HOI并提高fMRI诊断精度，实现了新技术基准。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

Abstract: Real-world optimization often demands diverse, high-quality solutions.
Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a multifaceted approach in evolutionary
algorithms that aims to generate a set of solutions that are both
high-performing and diverse. QD algorithms have been successfully applied
across various domains, providing robust solutions by exploring diverse
behavioral niches. However, their application has primarily focused on static
problems, with limited exploration in the context of dynamic combinatorial
optimization problems. Furthermore, the theoretical understanding of QD
algorithms remains underdeveloped, particularly when applied to learning
heuristics instead of directly learning solutions in complex and dynamic
combinatorial optimization domains, which introduces additional challenges.
This paper introduces a novel QD framework for dynamic scheduling problems. We
propose a map-building strategy that visualizes the solution space by linking
heuristic genotypes to their behaviors, enabling their representation on a QD
map. This map facilitates the discovery and maintenance of diverse scheduling
heuristics. Additionally, we conduct experiments on both fixed and dynamically
changing training instances to demonstrate how the map evolves and how the
distribution of solutions unfolds over time. We also discuss potential future
research directions that could enhance the learning process and broaden the
applicability of QD algorithms to dynamic combinatorial optimization
challenges.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints

characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the

These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same

influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms

fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex

visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种实践中可行的MOEAs运行时间评估方法，作为理论研究的实际补充，并提供了基于Web的实现以支持更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become essential tools
for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), making their running
time analysis crucial for assessing algorithmic efficiency and guiding
practical applications. While significant theoretical advances have been
achieved for combinatorial optimization, existing studies for numerical
optimization primarily rely on algorithmic or problem simplifications, limiting
their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose an
experimental approach for estimating upper bounds on the running time of MOEAs
in numerical optimization without simplification assumptions. Our approach
employs an average gain model that characterizes algorithmic progress through
the Inverted Generational Distance metric. To handle the stochastic nature of
MOEAs, we use statistical methods to estimate the probabilistic distribution of
gains. Recognizing that gain distributions in numerical optimization exhibit
irregular patterns with varying densities across different regions, we
introduce an adaptive sampling method that dynamically adjusts sampling density
to ensure accurate surface fitting for running time estimation. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on five representative MOEAs (NSGA-II, MOEA/D,
AR-MOEA, AGEMOEA-II, and PREA) using the ZDT and DTLZ benchmark suites. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating upper
bounds on the running time without requiring algorithmic or problem
simplifications. Additionally, we provide a web-based implementation to
facilitate broader adoption of our methodology. This work provides a practical
complement to theoretical research on MOEAs in numerical optimization.

Conclusion: 多增益模型为($\mu+\lambda$)进化算法解决组合优化问题的运行时间分析提供了有效工具，对相关问题的研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The running-time analysis of evolutionary combinatorial optimization is a
fundamental topic in evolutionary computation. However, theoretical results
regarding the $(\mu+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm (EA) for combinatorial
optimization problems remain relatively scarce compared to those for simple
pseudo-Boolean problems. This paper proposes a multiple-gain model to analyze
the running time of EAs for combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed
model is an improved version of the average gain model, which is a
fitness-difference drift approach under the sigma-algebra condition to estimate
the running time of evolutionary numerical optimization. The improvement yields
a framework for estimating the expected first hitting time of a stochastic
process in both average-case and worst-case scenarios. It also introduces novel
running-time results of evolutionary combinatorial optimization, including two
tighter time complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for the knapsack problem with favorably correlated weights,
a closed-form expression of time complexity upper bound in the case of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for general $k$-MAX-SAT problems and a tighter time
complexity upper bounds than the known results in the case of ($\mu+\lambda$)
EA for the traveling salesperson problem. Experimental results indicate that
the practical running time aligns with the theoretical results, verifying that
the multiple-gain model is an effective tool for running-time analysis of
($\mu+\lambda$) EA for combinatorial optimization problems.
