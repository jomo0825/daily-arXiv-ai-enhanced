Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest
developments in the field, with a focus on deep learning techniques, especially
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and twin networks (Siamese networks),
which have played a pivotal role in improving the accuracy of covering face
recognition. The paper discusses the most prominent challenges, which include
changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and

trends such as developing more efficient algorithms and integrating multimedia
technologies to improve the performance of recognition systems in real-world
environments and expand their applications.

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种嵌入不可察觉但可验证痕迹的方法，用于验证图像数据集是否被第三方模型违规使用，同时保持数据集的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像数据集中包含敏感或专有内容，未经授权使用会引发重大问题，因此需要可靠的方法验证数据集的使用情况。

Method: 提出HoneyImage，通过对少量难样本进行选择性修改，嵌入可验证的痕迹，同时不破坏数据完整性。

Result: 经四个基准数据集和多种模型架构验证，HoneyImage在保持数据不可察觉性的同时，达到了高验证准确性和极小的下游性能影响。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用工具，保护图像数据集所有权，促进数据安全共享，释放AI的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

### [4] [Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00896)
*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种新型的单阶段去噪扩散框架，能够同时合成微观结构图像及其分割掩码，从而提升金属显微结构图像分割的准确性，特别是在少数类上效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习在冶金显微结构分割中的效果受限于人工标注相位掩膜的稀缺性，特别是在处理稀有或复杂金属合金形态时，数据注释的不足成为瓶颈。

Method: 提出PF-DiffSeg框架，通过全局相位分数矢量进行条件生成，在单次生成过程中同时生成显微结构图像和对应的分割掩码；强调少数类的表示和逼真数据分布的增强，改进数据多样性和训练效率。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试上，该方法在多相钢的分割准确性上优于传统增强策略，在少数类表现尤其显著；相较于两阶段掩膜引导扩散和GAN基线方法，不仅取得更好的准确性，还显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg提供了一种集成生成和条件处理的统一框架，为冶金显微图像分析中的数据增强问题提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了结合自动编码器与时序序列建模的混合深度学习方法在视频帧预测中的应用，实验结果表明，使用3DCNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频帧预测在天气预测和自动系统等领域具有重要应用，现有模型有改进空间，作者欲研究混合深度学习模型的性能。

Method: 评估了结合自动编码器（用于特征提取）和时序模型（如3DCNN、RNN）的若干深度学习方法，并使用三种数据集进行实验比较。

Result: 实验表明，SSIM指标从0.69提升到0.82，混合模型中采用3DCNN与ConvLSTM的效果最佳，且灰度真实数据最易预测。

Conclusion: 混合架构的深度学习方法对视频帧预测有效，尤其是3DCNN与ConvLSTM的结合，适合预测灰度真实数据。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TESPEC，一个为时序信息设计的自监督预训练框架，在事件感知任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件感知自监督学习方法大多模仿RGB图像方法，未充分考虑事件的时序信息。

Method: TESPEC采用掩码图像建模范式，设计了一种新的重建目标，将事件累积成伪灰度视频以捕捉场景语义信息，同时对抗传感器噪声和减少运动模糊。

Result: 实验表明，TESPEC在目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等下游任务中达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: TESPEC是首个在事件感知任务中利用长时间事件序列进行预训练的框架，证明了时序信息在这些任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Conclusion: 潜在扩散的增强方法在法医面部识别应用中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中跨模态注意力匹配不佳、性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出了CCRA方法，包括Layer-Patch-wise Cross Attention和Progressive Attention Integration两部分，分别捕捉细粒度区域-语义关联并协调各层次注意机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了性能，在10个基准测试中实现了最先进的表现，仅增加了3.55M参数并提高了解释性。

Conclusion: CCRA方法有效改进了视觉语言模型的注意力机制，提升了性能并保持较低参数成本，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Motivation: 通过训练深度学习模型进行语义分割，旨在提升红外热成像技术在不同运动场景中的适应性，尤其是减少手动标注数据的依赖。

Method: 在自动标注生成的标签基础上，加入少量手动标注数据，通过语义分割网络的微调训练分析不同数据组合对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验发现，少量手动标注数据可显著提升神经网络性能，并通过自动标注与手动标注的结合加速模型适应新场景。

Conclusion: 红外热成像结合深度学习的自动标注方法，在少量手动干预下，可有效迁移至新领域应用。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量的实例定位文本到图像生成的合成数据集，由100万精选网络图像组成，强调重新描述策略结合VLM生成视觉描述及LLM提取类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有检测数据集类别有限及质量不足的问题，同时捕捉人类难以顾及的次要视觉元素。

Method: 提出了重新描述策略，通过VLM生成全面的视觉描述并结合LLM提取类别，用于开放词汇检测器检测，构建具有高分辨率、高类别多样性的数据集。

Result: ROVI数据集在质量、分辨率和开放词汇类别数量均优于现有数据集，训练的GLIGEN模型在实例定位、提示忠实度和美学质量上超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: ROVI为实例定位文本到图像生成提供了一个优质数据集，展示了重新描述策略的有效性，并开源数据集及生成流程。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AutoSIGHT，通过眼动追踪数据自动分类专家和非专家，评估人类解决视觉任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用机器通过眼动追踪特征自动评估人类专业水平的可行性。

Method: 基于眼动追踪数据的特征提取，构建分类模型并采用ROC曲线评估性能，与人类处理虹膜攻击检测任务结合实验分析。

Result: 在5秒的评估窗口中，平均ROC曲线下面积为0.751；在30秒窗口中提高到0.8306，表现更为精准，但决策有所延迟。

Conclusion: 验证了通过眼动追踪评估人类专业水平的可行性，并提供相关数据，支持人类与AI协作中的动态专业分布反应研究。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了增量式运动恢复结构（SfM）管道的实现及其在稀疏或部分重叠数据集中的高效性，重点讨论几何估计一致性及优化调整效果，并通过实测数据检验了其在3D重建中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在机器人、地图绘制和场景理解等应用中实现精确的3D重建，克服全局SfM对噪声和缺失数据的敏感性。

Method: 使用增量SfM方法通过逐步加入新视图构建场景结构及相机运动轨迹，并通过束调整优化结果的一致性与精度。

Result: 通过使用实际数据，评估了增量SfM的重建质量，包括重投影误差和相机轨迹的连贯性，证明其实用性可靠。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种适用于稀疏3D重建的可靠方法，在结构化视觉环境中具有重要实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查的增多，需求自动化方法（比如器官分割、异常检测和报告生成）以减轻放射科医生的工作负担。

Method: 利用图模型，将CT扫描构造成结构化图，通过光谱域卷积对轴向切片三元组节点进行处理，增强多标签异常分类性能。

Result: 方法展现了较强的跨数据集泛化能力和对z轴平移的鲁棒性，性能也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: 新方法有效应对了体积数据复杂的空间关系和异常多样性问题，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文讨论了深度学习中的数据版权保护，通过引入一种新的规避框架展示了当前方法的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析现有数据所有权验证（DOV）方法的缺陷，发现现有方法对于规避攻击的评估过于简单化，导致安全性被高估。

Method: 提出了一个统一的规避框架，利用教师模型和出分布数据（OOD）集，通过任务相关性和标识符独立性的转移，提升规避效率和泛化能力。

Result: 新框架能够完全消除版权标识符，在泛化和规避有效性上全面优于现有的九种规避攻击方法，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 现有数据所有权验证方法存在关键脆弱性，需要从长远发展角度增强其实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom

performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

Motivation: 传统开放集识别依赖熟悉度假设，而该研究认为训练中的小权重特征被忽略，未能将有用信息充分利用。

Method: 通过提出一种衰减假设，将训练中小权重的特征视为潜在有用信息，并使用COSTARR模型综合熟悉特征和不熟悉特征的缺失，提供一种概率解释模型得分的方法，并进行了消融研究分析主攻区域。

Result: 在大规模数据集和多种架构下进行了实验验证，COSTARR模型展现了卓越的泛化能力，优于当前先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过综合利用被忽视但重要的特征信息，COSTARR显著改进了开放集识别的性能，在多个场景中均表现卓越。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于RGBA图像透明区域修复的单阶段方法Trans-Adapter，能够与现有扩散式修复模型无缝融合，并引入了新的评价指标与基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RGBA图像处理方法多阶段流程复杂，且透明区域修复质量不足，亟需一种更便捷且高质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Trans-Adapter，一种可插拔式适配器，可扩展现有扩散模型直接处理RGBA图像，支持透明区域修复与可控编辑，并集成于多种社区模型中。同时设计了LayerBench基准和一种新的无参考透明边缘质量评估指标。

Result: 通过在LayerBench上的大量实验，验证了Trans-Adapter在提高透明边缘修复质量和保持透明一致性方面的效果。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter显著提升了RGBA图像透明区域修复的质量，简化了流程，并在社区模型中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预设的材料先验，无法应对未知材料的情况。

Method: MASIV采用可学习的神经本构模型，并通过重建连续介质粒子轨迹引入密集几何指导，从而克服优化过程中的不稳定性并保持物理合理性。

Result: 实验表明，MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力方面达到了当前最优表现。

Conclusion: MASIV是一种无需场景特定材料先验的视觉系统辨识方法，能够广泛适用并在准确性和质量上表现出色。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Motivation: 研究如何通过监督微调、强化学习和链式思维推理提升图像编辑任务的性能。

Method: 采用统一处理文本和视觉信号的自回归多模态模型，并结合强化学习和多模态大语言模型验证器。

Result: EARL模型在广泛的图像编辑任务中表现出优越性能，显著推动了自回归多模态模型的开发。

Conclusion: EARL在图像编辑任务中展现出竞争力，尽管其使用的训练数据较少，但效果优于多个强基线模型。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

TL;DR: 论文提出了用于生成和预测第一人称场景下人体运动的统一模型UniEgoMotion，并展示了其在图像输入基础上建模的高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注第三人称的运动生成，对真实第一人称场景中存在的视野限制、遮挡和动态摄像影响较大的问题缺乏解决方案，因此需要一个能够在第一人称场景中生成和预测运动的统一框架。

Method: 提出了UniEgoMotion模型，该模型基于头部中心的运动表示，利用图像中的场景语义进行运动重建和预测，并引入了EE4D-Motion数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，UniEgoMotion在第一人称运动重建中达到了最新性能，首次实现了从单张图像生成3D运动，建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: 研究证明了UniEgoMotion框架的有效性，为第一人称应用领域开辟了新的可能性，如增强AR/VR体验和改进人机交互。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种领域无关的半监督异常检测框架，通过深度强化学习（DRL）应对大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡问题，集中于脑部MRI体积的异常检测，表现优于现有方法并具有跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测面临数据规模大、标准不平衡等问题，尤其在医疗数据中，健康和异常样本间的比例失衡尤为显著，需要一种有效的、领域无关的方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 利用深度强化学习（DRL）与特征表示相结合，开发半监督领域无关的异常检测框架，适用于大规模医疗影像数据，同时避免过拟合问题，涵盖数据预处理、实验设计及多种评价指标。

Result: 在脑部MRI数据上，该方法在像素级达到88.7%的AUROC，图像级达到96.7%，均优于SOTA方法；在工业数据（如MVTec AD）上，模型也表现出很高的竞争力，表现出较强的跨领域推广能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在医疗和工业领域都展示了高效、鲁棒和广泛的适用性，强调了其在现实医疗应用中的潜力。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过颜色补偿来改进数据集凝练的方法DC3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据集凝练中要么效率不高，要么引入语义失真，且忽视了颜色在语义表示和信息传递中的重要性。

Method: 通过校准选择策略，利用潜在扩散模型提升图像的颜色多样性，而非重新生成图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中表现出色，并首次使用凝练数据集对预训练扩散模型进行微调，验证了模型训练无崩溃或退化问题。

Conclusion: 提出的DC3框架不仅提升了数据集凝练的性能，还保证了语义的完整性，为相关研究提供了新的方法和视角。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion显著改善了开放词汇查询场景下的3D理解与重建，推动了VR/AR及机器人应用的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

Motivation: 目前的文本到图像扩散模型在生成内容时未能充分考虑用户个性化需求和安全边界。

Method: 提出了PSA框架，结合新数据集Sage和交叉注意机制，实现用户个性化安全喜好与扩散过程相结合。

Result: 实验显示PSA在有害内容抑制和生成内容符合用户约束方面表现优异，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA为文本到图像生成模型提供了一个结合个性化安全偏好的解决方案，同时保持图像质量，推动了生成模型的安全性进步。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Method: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的框架，结合宏观语言控制和微观窗口细化，并通过模式切换器协调其独立或联合操作。

Result: 在DIS5K基准数据集上显著超越了11种前沿方法，尤其相比第二名模型MVANet，Fβω指标分别提升了4.6%和3.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架展现了卓越的分割性能以及高灵活度和适应性，适合个性化、高精度应用场景。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

Motivation: 场景文本识别由于复杂的视觉外观和有限的语义先验具有挑战性。

Method: 提出TEACH训练范式，通过在训练中注入目标标签作为辅助输入并逐步减少其影响，同时使用目标感知遮蔽，模拟从依赖标签学习到完全视觉识别的课程学习过程。

Result: 在多个公共基准上的广泛实验表明，TEACH能够在特别是具有挑战性的条件下实现一致的精度提高。

Conclusion: TEACH方法无需外部预训练，无推理开销，且模型无关性，可以无缝整合到现有的编码器-解码器框架中，验证了其鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理大量轨迹时计算成本高，因此需要改进。

Method: 采用粗到细策略逐步扩展跟踪点集，并设计学习型插值模块，同时提出优化减少相关特征计算的成本。

Result: 相较现有方法，速度提升了5-100倍并保持先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了计算瓶颈问题，显著提升了视频中3D点跟踪的速度和准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Result: 在没有位姿监督的情况下，在视图合成和相对位姿估计任务上实现了超越最新方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一个高效且无需位姿监督的3D建模框架SPFSplat，适合实际应用且具有先进的性能。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Method: 本方法通过跨模态三维表征学习和多尺度几何特征传播，结合两阶段的推理机制，将定位与分类任务绑定以改进学习表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，本方法在可操作性定位和分类任务上均取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究优化了观察学习方法，为解决Embodied AI中基于观察的对象操作学习核心问题提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Conclusion: 利用卫星图像结合深度学习模型可快速、经济地评估道路状况，为未来的道路网评估提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RoadMamba的新方法，结合了全局和局部的感知，解决了以往Mamba架构在路面分类任务上的局限性，并在包含百万样本的大规模数据集上取得了最优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba架构在视觉任务中虽然表现出色，但在路面分类任务中因缺乏对局部纹理的有效提取而效果有限，需要一种结合全局语义和局部纹理的解决方案。

Method: 通过Dual State Space Model（DualSSM）提取路面全局语义和局部纹理，Dual Attention Fusion（DAF）对双分支特征进行解码和融合，并引入双辅助损失约束网络避免只依赖全局语义信息。

Result: 实验在包含100万样本的大规模路面分类数据集上显示，所提出的RoadMamba方法达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba方法有效结合了全局和局部信息，解决了传统Mamba架构的局限性，为自动驾驶的路面信息识别提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StyDeco的不监督框架，通过学习特定任务的文本表征来提升风格迁移的效果，解决了现有扩散模型在风格转移任务中的核心局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在风格迁移中存在一个主要问题，即将文本描述作为单一的引导，无法顾及文本描述的非空间特性和视觉风格的空间敏感属性间的语义差距。

Method: 通过Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD)自动合成伪配对数据，无需人工监督，并提出Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD)实现任务特定的文本编码器调整，鼓励源和目标表示形成独立聚类。

Result: 在三个经典的基准数据集上，实验表明该框架在风格一致性和结构保留方面均优于现有方法，同时支持去风格化操作，展现了强大的扩展能力。

Conclusion: StyDeco框架有效解决了扩散模型的局限性，提升了风格迁移任务中的语义结构保留和细节呈现能力，且具有较好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FLoc方法容易因为平面图中的重复结构导致定位不明确，现有技术未充分利用视觉图像中丰富的上下文信息。

Method: 利用无监督学习技术，通过集群约束预训练一个房间分类器，该分类器通过提取房间视觉图像隐藏的类别信息，并将此信息整合到FLoc算法中，提升场景信息的利用。

Result: 实验在两个标准FLoc基准数据集上进行了对比研究，显示该方法优于现有最先进的技术，并显著提高了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引入房间场景上下文知识，本文方法有效缓解了平面图定位中的不确定性问题，实现了更精确和鲁棒的定位。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有3D头像重建方法存在网格与目标图像对齐不良的问题，导致渲染质量较差且细节丢失。

Method: 提出了带有动量更新表情库及表情校正机制的动量引导一致几何模块，以及潜在纹理注意机制以改进纹理渲染。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在不准确网格初始化和复杂环境下仍能实现高保真的头像重建和高质量的视角合成。

Conclusion: MoGaFace实现了更高质量和细节保真的3D头像建模，是现有方法的显著改进。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决梯度下降优化中权重分布紊乱导致的特征不清晰和学习困难问题。

Method: 提出了Eigen Neural Network（ENN）架构，利用各层共享的学习正交矩阵重新参数化权重，与标准BP整合，并提出无BP的局部学习变种ENN-$\ell$。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大型图像分类基准上显著优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中树立了新标杆。ENN-$\ell$通过并行化实现训练速度提升超过2倍，且精度超过端到端BP。

Conclusion: ENN重新定义了神经网络的表征架构，在解决代表性缺陷的同时，实现更高效、更性能优越的训练方法。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN 不仅保留了传统 RevSNNs 的内存节省优势，还解决了高延迟问题，是资源受限场景中的理想选择。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于多缓存的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP），通过三种缓存优化模型在零样本设定下对未知测试分布的性能提升，并展示其在15个任务中的SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存增强TTA方法利用低熵准则构建原型，但在分布移位下可能不可靠。本文旨在研究类内紧凑性和缓存增强性能的相关性，并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存（初始化原型）、对齐缓存（整合视觉与文本信息）和负缓存（预测校准）。进一步优化框架为MCP++，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的对比和消融实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的泛化性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过创新的多缓存机制和优化框架，本文方法在测试时间适应任务中显著提升了模型泛化性能，为处理分布移位问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Conclusion: 框架通过模糊不确定性校准和视角去偏，有效解决开放集多视角学习中的视角偏差问题并提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Motivation: 解决大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）高计算成本的问题，尤其是针对视觉输入序列中的冗余信息处理。

Method: 提出ACCM方法，包括轻量化字幕生成器和选择器两部分。字幕生成器生成与问题相关的图像描述，选择器选择适合语境的字幕，并通过自监督学习进行高效模型训练。

Result: 在7个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，同时能减少计算量（例如，以6.5%更少的FLOPs超越SOTA方法20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM展示了在降低计算成本的同时保持或提升性能的潜力，证明了通过图像字幕生成缓解视觉信息损失的可行性。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Result: OCSplats在不同复杂度场景中实现了领先的3D重建与噪声分类性能。

Conclusion: OCSplats无需超参数调优即可在不同噪声比例的场景中适用，提升了抗噪场景的泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Conclusion: NS-Net框架在检测AI生成图像方面展示了良好的泛化性能，对解决生成模型滥用问题具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Conclusion: DisFaceRep在解决弱监督场景下人脸组件分割问题方面表现出色，为减少复杂标注工作提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zihan Li,Wei Sun,Jing Hu,Jianhua Yin,Jianlong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态语义一致性和自增强的图像聚类框架，显著提升了聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中冻结编码器导致的任务不可知表示与具体聚类任务需求之间的不匹配问题。

Method: 框架分为两个阶段，第一阶段通过跨模态语义一致性对预训练模型的语义对齐，利用动态平衡正则化和更优质聚类中心生成提高一致性；第二阶段通过自增强方法，以第一阶段生成的伪标签为监督信号，优化视觉编码器和聚类头。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有深度聚类方法，用更小模型达到了或超过了现有更大模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合跨模态语义一致性和自增强，突破了现有图像聚类性能瓶颈，为高效图像聚类提供了新方法。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

*Zhengxue Wang,Yuan Wu,Xiang Li,Zhiqiang Yan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的时空差分网络（STDNet），改善视频深度超分辨率的长尾问题，并在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率受长尾分布问题的影响，特别是在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域中表现显著，需要一种方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了时空差分网络（STDNet），包括空间差分分支和时间差分分支，分别处理空间和时间的长尾问题，采用动态特征对齐和运动补偿技术。

Result: 通过多个数据集验证，STDNet在视频深度超分辨率任务中效果显著，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet有效缓解了长尾分布问题，提高了视频深度超分辨率的精度，可作为改进现有方法的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的数据精炼在扩展到更高的IPC或图像分辨率时面临性能下降，而现有采用扩散生成模型的方法存在样本多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出ACS方法，通过对抗性损失指导扩散采样过程，将精炼数据集划分为多个课程，并通过课程间减少信息重叠来生成更多样化的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，ACS在Imagewoof数据集上提升了4.1%的性能，在ImageNet-1k上提升了2.1%。

Conclusion: ACS方法通过系统化、渐进式的采样过程，有效提高了数据精炼的效率和质量，展示出优越的性能提升。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 为了解决现有基准中缺乏细粒度评估不确定性的问题，设计了一种能生成噪声和点云不确定性标注的方法。

Method: 对三种流行模型（PointNet, DGCNN, Point Transformer v3）在不同噪声水平下进行评估，使用分类准确率、校准度量和对不确定性的感知能力作为评价指标。

Result: 所有模型在噪声增加时性能下降，但Point Transformer v3的校准性能最佳，其预测的不确定性与实际测量不确定性更加一致。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E可为评估点云模型的鲁棒性和校准性提供一种新方式，Point Transformer v3表现出最佳校准性能。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap)的方法用于零样本视频字幕生成，通过引入多帧信息和显式的时间关系建模，提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本视频字幕生成方法不能有效利用视频的时间动态特性，因此需要一个新方法来更好地捕捉视频的时间信息和因果关系。

Method: 开发了语义分组解码(SGD)策略和两个重要模块：关键句选择(KSS)模块和概率采样监督(PSS)模块，从而更好地处理视频间的时间动态与语义因果关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，SGCap显著优于已有的零样本方法，且性能可媲美部分完全监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的SGCap方法通过整合多帧和序列关系，使得零样本视频字幕生成方法更加高效，并证明了其在实际任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一种结合轻量级文本监督嵌入和推理时门控控制网络的框架，旨在应对T2I模型中生成NSFW内容的挑战，实现对有害内容的强力保护，同时保留合法生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型易生成不安全内容，但现有的软提示调整方法存在计算成本高、图像质量下降和难以适应复杂安全需求的问题。

Method: 设计PromptSafe框架：通过LLM重写不安全提示生成文本训练集，优化通用软提示，并引入门控机制，根据提示的风险自适应调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe在多个基准和模型中实现了SOTA性能（不安全生成率2.36%），并展示了对未知有害类别的泛化能力和鲁棒性，同时具有较高的迁移性和抗对抗攻击性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe有效平衡了生成质量和安全性要求，展现了实际应用价值和可扩展性，适合T2I模型的安全部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无监督立体匹配框架，结合了视差置信度估计和深度先验引导损失函数，显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督立体匹配方法由于纹理少和重复模式易引入误差，且3D几何知识转移低效且存在噪音。

Method: 设计了一个结合可插拔视差置信度估计及两种深度先验导向损失的新框架。通过视差局部一致性判定置信度，用置信视差构建准稠密对应关系，同时加入双重视差平滑损失。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准数据集上，方法在所有无监督立体匹配方法中取得了最新的最优精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无监督立体匹配中的模糊问题，能够高效地利用3D几何知识，表现出色。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

<details>

Motivation: 解决当前基于MIL的WSI分类中，通过简单文本类描述引入医学知识时的表达受限问题，尤其是生成的描述缺乏领域基础和医学细节。

Method: 1）开发一个多智能体描述生成系统，从病理教科书中提取精确多样的临床描述；2）设计一种基于描述列表的文本编码策略，以捕获更细粒度和互补的临床信号。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的框架增强了文本和视觉特征之间的对齐，改进了WSI分类效果，并为未来在其他医学图像分析任务的应用提供了潜在可能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Motivation: 当前基于合成数据训练的立体匹配模型在处理真实数据时常因领域差异（如颜色、光照、对比和纹理）而表现较差亟需提高模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过扰动RGB空间的图像统计（均值和标准差）生成未见领域样本，并利用基于批量统计的高斯分布模拟扰动方向和强度的不确定性。此外，通过原始数据与增强数据的特征一致性约束，激励模型学习结构感知且对捷径不敏感的特征表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个挑战性的基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 方法简单、与架构无关，可集成到任何立体匹配网络中，且显著提升了模型的跨领域能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架可以高效地实现多任务、多类别下的3D异常检测，并在应对新类别时达到优异性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Conclusion: 通过CSINet框架，该论文解决了遥感图像中小型及模糊目标分割的主要挑战，提供了一种高效的全局与局部语义协同处理的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the

TL;DR: 本文提出StyleSentinel，用于通过验证艺术作品的内在风格指纹来保护艺术版权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对扩散模型生成定制图像导致的艺术作品未经授权使用问题，需有效方法保护在线发布的作品免受侵权。

Method: 本方法通过语义自重构增强艺术品的风格表达能力，利用自适应多层特征融合生成紧凑风格指纹，并通过特征空间的最小包围超球模型艺术风格，使版权验证任务转化为一类学习问题。

Result: 实验表明StyleSentinel在单样本验证任务上表现优于现有方法，并在在线平台验证了其效果。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel能够有效保护艺术作品的版权，展示了一种对抗未授权使用的新方法。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出ViLaCo，一种利用视觉语言模型（VLM）的弱监督图像篡改定位方法，通过联合视觉与文本信息实现高效像素级定位，只需图像级标签即可操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前图像篡改定位依赖耗时的像素级注释，现有弱监督方法性能仍受限，缺乏外部语义指导。为此，作者提出一种结合视觉与语言的协同推理框架以提升精度。

Method: 方法提出ViLaCo框架，包括视觉语言特征建模网络、适应性视觉语言推理网络及对比补丁一致性模块，结合粗定位及细粒度定位双预测头，强化篡改区域区分。

Result: 在多项公共数据集上，ViLaCo显著优于现有弱监督方法，在检测与定位精度方面达到了最新的高水准。

Conclusion: ViLaCo框架有效结合视觉与语言知识，实现了低成本高精度的图像篡改像素级定位，证明了其在弱监督任务中的优越性与实用性。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Result: 在场景表示实验中，RandSF.Q方法在对象发现任务中比现有方法提升了多达10个百分点，达到了新的最高水平，并且在动态建模等下游任务中也表现优秀。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q通过克服现有方法的不足，在无监督对象中心学习中展示了显著优势，为后续相关研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in

approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Conclusion: NTM方法可以减少生成数字地形图所需的人工预处理工作，提升效率的同时保证出色的精度，未来有望促进行星探索任务的发展。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Conclusion: OAPR任务拓宽了基于属性的检索技术的应用范围，框架能够有效应对开放集场景的属性识别问题。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Result: 框架通过结合空间和频率域的特征，有效改善了RAW图像中的细节表现，提高了目标检测的效果。

Conclusion: 融合空间和频率表示的方法在RAW图像目标检测中展现出优越表现，为该领域的研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Motivation: 解决RGB为基础的3D任务中标注稀缺及增强技术稀少的问题，同时克服图像变换破坏几何一致性的挑战。

Method: 提出一种名为3DRot的方法，通过在相机光轴中心进行几何一致的旋转和镜像操作，同时更新相关数据，如RGB图像、相机参数、物体姿态以及3D标注，从而保持射影几何的一致性。该方法不依赖场景深度，适用于多种3D任务。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上的单目3D检测任务中，3DRot使得$IoU_{3D}$从43.21提升到44.51，旋转误差从22.91°降低到20.93°，$mAP_{0.5}$从35.70提升到38.11。

Conclusion: 3DRot作为一种轻量级、通用的增强方法，不依赖于场景深度，具有良好的任务迁移能力，能显著改进RGB为基础的3D任务的性能。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

*Zhuoran Peng,Yiqing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的高光谱图像(HSI)恢复模型，通过多粒度非局部自相似先验约束来增强适应性，提高图像恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HSI恢复方法无法适应多样化的缺失场景，因此需要一种能自适应的方案。

Method: 引入了张量分解的粒度概念，提出通过交替执行粗粒度的Tucker分解和细粒度的FCTN分解的方法，统一表征HSI中的全局、局部以及非局部的先验信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法对于像素缺失、条纹缺失等多种场景具有极强的适用性，恢复效果显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型通过多粒度分解有效结合了HSI的多种先验，可广泛应用于多种缺失场景，具有优越的恢复性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床实践中，医学图像分割缺乏注解时评估质量困难，影响其可信度和广泛应用。

Method: 提出两种框架：一种利用分割和不确定性图，另一种结合输入图像、不确定性图及分割图；通过蒙特卡洛Dropout等技术量化不确定性，并测试四种不确定性估计量；提出聚合策略及使用Grad-CAM和UMAP分析模型行为。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在无需人工标注的情况下有效评估分割质量，具有挑战现有方法的表现，同时提供更加可靠和全面的评估方案。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Can3Tok，一个用于编码3D场景的变分自编码器（VAE），解决了以往3D场景生成中因尺度不一致所导致的挑战，并在DL3DV-10K数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于当前3D生成主要集中在对象层级，缺乏在场景层面有效扩展潜在表示学习的模型，因此研究3D场景层次生成具有重要意义。

Method: 设计了变分自编码器Can3Tok，并提出了一种通用的3D场景数据处理管道，解决了数据中的尺度不一致问题，同时生成低维的潜在表征以描述语义及空间信息。

Result: Can3Tok在DL3DV-10K数据集上，实现了对新的3D场景的成功泛化，而其他基准方法在训练中无法收敛，推理时也缺乏泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅提出了首个3D场景层级的变分自编码器，还展示了Can3Tok在图像到3D和文本到3D生成任务中的潜力，为场景级别的3D生成拓展了新的可能性。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast
and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability,
interpretability, and generalization.

Method: 提出MiraGe，基于生成器无关的特征学习，通过最小化类内变化和最大化类间分离，实现特征的判别性。引入多模态提示学习，利用文本嵌入作为语义锚点，增强通用性。

Result: MiraGe在多项基准测试中表现优异，并在面对未知生成器（如Sora）时依然保持高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MiraGe是一种具有通用性和鲁棒性的AI生成图像检测方法，通过生成器无关特征学习实现，对改进现有技术有积极意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Motivation: 当前的小规模多模态模型在视频理解中对细粒度时间推理能力有限，因此需要一种方法来提升小模型的时间推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的训练方法，ReasonAct有效提升了小规模模型的视频推理性能，同时保持了计算效率，使其达到具有竞争力的水平。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

TL;DR: 本文提出了E-VRAG框架，通过筛选相关帧和轻量化模型，显著降低了计算成本并提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在处理长视频时存在上下文窗口限制与高计算成本问题，视频检索增强生成方法（RAG）虽能减少负担，但在多样化复杂视频中表现有限。

Method: E-VRAG通过层级式查询分解过滤帧、轻量化视觉语言模型打分、基于帧得分分布的检索策略，以及多视角问答优化长视频信息提取。

Result: 在四个公共基准上，E-VRAG相比基线方法能减少约70%的计算成本，同时实现更高的精度，且无须额外训练。

Conclusion: E-VRAG框架有效提升了视频RAG任务的效率与准确性，表明其在复杂视频理解中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法多采用固定压缩率，无法适应场景复杂性变化，导致丢失关键信息，从而影响模型性能。

Method: 提出了GlimpsePrune框架，通过数据驱动的动态修剪，在生成答案前的单次前向传递中去除不相关的视觉标记。

Result: GlimpsePrune在修剪92.6%视觉标记的情况下，保持了视觉问答任务中的基线性能。增强版GlimpsePrune+提高了性能至基线的110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大、更高效的大型视觉语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型的适配算法自动化优化开辟了新可能，为未来的模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

Motivation: 解决传统LiDAR传感器忽视真实场景中时间连续性的问题，从而减少感知冗余和能耗，以适配资源受限的平台应用。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级预测器网络从历史的时空上下文中提取精炼的查询嵌入，结合使用Gumbel-Softmax采样的Mask生成网络，生成识别下一帧关键ROI的二进制掩码，实现自适应的稠密-稀疏采样。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，该方法在减少超过65%的LiDAR能耗的同时，与传统的稠密扫描LiDAR-相机融合方法相比，保持了竞争性甚至更好的3D目标检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过将预测性和历史意识结合到LiDAR扫描中，该框架在降低能耗效率的同时，实现了高性能的3D目标检测，为资源有限的场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户不仅删除数据，还需从训练模型中完全移除数据影响。实现这一目标对当前的ViTs来说是一项挑战。

Method: 提出LetheViT，通过对比学习策略，采用遮罩处理生成正负对数值，指导模型遗忘特定样本的细节信息，但保留类别的大致轮廓特征。

Result: 实验表明，LetheViT实现了最先进的表现，在遵守隐私法规的前提下保持了模型性能平衡。

Conclusion: LetheViT是一种有效的对比学习方法，既能满足隐私法规要求，又能在计算机视觉任务中保持较高性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的图像处理方法在分析拓扑结构时存在不足，尤其是对医学图像中关键结构（例如连通分量、环等）的识别不敏感。

Method: 新方法TopoImages通过持久同调（Persistent Homology）计算图像局部的拓扑特征，生成拓扑图（TopoImages），同时采用不同滤波函数生成多视图TopoImages并融合原始图像进行深度学习分类。

Conclusion: TopoImages是一种通用且易于集成的框架，能够为深度学习带来高效的拓扑信息表示，从而提升图像分类性能，特别适用于医学图像领域。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为EgoLoc的零样本时序交互定位方法，用于识别人类与物体互动的时机，通过结合2D和3D信息采样并引入闭环反馈提高定位效率和精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对HOI操作定位依赖于人工标注分类，存在领域偏差和低效率问题；为此，提出能够不依赖标注也能精准定位互动时间的自动化方法。

Method: EgoLoc通过自适应采样策略，利用VLM生成视觉提示并结合2D和3D动态信息，分析手部速度生成高质量初步猜测，并结合闭环反馈细化结果。

Result: 在公开数据集和新提出的基准中，EgoLoc在以第一视角视频中表现出优于现有方法的时序交互定位效果。

Conclusion: EgoLoc有效解决了现有方法时序交互定位的不足，通过结合视觉提示与闭环反馈，实现效率与准确性的提升，适合应用于以第一视角视频的人类行为分析。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

*Lingfeng He,De Cheng,Huaijie Wang,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SECA的框架，结合文本先验和视觉原型改进，解决Continual Learning中的稳定性与适应性平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP中丰富的文本语义先验，解决稳定性与适应性之间的冲突。

Method: 提出了SG-AKT模块用于基于文本线索自适应知识转移，以及SE-VPR模块优化视觉原型提升语义结构。

Result: 在多个基准测试上表现出色，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过利用文本先验实现了知识转移的语义感知和视觉分类器的语义结构增强，为Continual Learning提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Xinhui Li,Xinyu He,Qiming Hu,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的领域泛化方法——Set Pivot Learning (SPL)，强调通过动态调整和适应Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)以优化其跨领域鲁棒性和特定任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VFMs在大量多样化数据上的成功训练，传统领域泛化方法中目标领域不可访问的假设已过时，因此需要建立更能反映现实需求的新方法论。

Method: 本文提出了Set Pivot Learning (SPL)，其特点包括动态适应和以VFM为中心的调整。此外，作者还设计了一个动态提示微调方法，结合动态类别感知提示器和提示引导特征聚焦模块，来提升VFM的表现。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法在基准数据集上表现优越，尤其是在通用化分割任务中优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Set Pivot Learning 改变了领域泛化任务的定义，更适合当下VFMs发展的背景，实验结果证明了该方法的有效性，对实际应用有重要意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在学习连续时间动态和预测随机运动序列时面临挑战，且容易忽视复杂人体运动的灵活性并导致模式崩塌。

Method: STCN包含两个阶段：第一阶段通过一个空间-时间连续网络生成平滑的运动序列，并引入锚集来处理模式崩塌问题；第二阶段利用锚集获取观察运动序列的高斯混合分布，同时通过对每个锚点采样多个序列减少人体动作的类内差异。

Result: 实验在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上进行，结果表明STCN在多样性和精确性上表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN成功在随机和连续人体运动预测任务上取得了良好的效果，可以更好地应对现有方法面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 解决终身行人再识别任务中因隐私问题无法存储历史样本而导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用多张真实图像的训练特征浓缩成单张图片，保护数据隐私的同时生成更具代表性的回放样本。在样式回放阶段对当前域和以往域进行双重对齐。

Result: Pr^2R在多个基准测试中显著提高了回放效果，任务准确率比当前最先进方法和基于回放的其他方法分别提升了4%和6%。

Conclusion: 提出的Pr^2R方法通过隐私保护的回放，有效缓解了领域转换引起的遗忘问题，是一种对性能和隐私兼顾的解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正常训练数据特征的检测方法存在局限，无法动态提升测试阶段的异常检测能力。

Method: SNARM框架通过对比测试图像与参考特征的残差，逐步选择可靠自生成参考补丁，自适应优化异常区域的特征提取，并利用自导航的Mamba模块实现精确的结果聚合。

Result: 在MVTec AD、MVTec 3D和VisA数据集进行了实验，通过Image-AUROC、Pixel-AURC等多种指标验证性能，达到了当前最先进的效果（SOTA）。

Conclusion: SNARM方法显著提高了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性，同时展示了框架在多任务环境中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过设计高效的适配器模块，提升时空多模态跟踪的性能，同时减少需训练的参数数量。

Method: 引入两个关键模块：时空模态适配器（STMA）和渐进模态互补适配器（PMCA）。STMA通过自提示调整从冻结骨干网提取的时空特征，而PMCA通过浅层和深层适配器逐步促进模态融合。

Result: DMTrack使用仅0.93M的可训练参数，在五个基准数据集上实现了最先进的时空多模态跟踪性能。

Conclusion: DMTrack设计简单且高效，利用适配器模块显著提升了多模态跟踪性能，证明了其在计算效率和结果质量上的优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床数据的不平衡性以及传统方法的不足（如过拟合或欠拟合，缺乏跨模态交互），需要一种新的方法来更准确地诊断疾病。

Method: 设计了一个多模态课程测量器结合了模态内信心和模态间互补性，以识别关键样本；同时，提出分布引导的训练调度器，逐步适应类别分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种数据集上表现优于现有方法，并能有效处理不平衡的多模态医疗数据。

Conclusion: CLIMD框架不仅提升了不平衡多模态数据的诊断性能，还具备作为即插即用框架扩展至其他模型的潜力。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以捕捉细粒度病理特征，导致脑肿瘤亚型分类效果有限。

Method: FG-PAN框架包括两个模块：局部特征优化模块，用于增强视觉特征；以及使用大语言模型生成的细粒度文本描述模块，用于生成语义原型，并实现文本和视觉特征对齐。

Result: 在EBRAINS和TCGA等多个公开病理数据集上进行实验，FG-PAN展示了最先进的性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FG-PAN框架提高了视觉和语义空间的类别区分能力，为零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的AI生成图像检测方法对未见生成器生成的伪造图像泛化能力不足，需要一种能够更好应对多样化伪造图像的新方法。

Method: 设计IAPL框架，包含条件信息学习器和基于置信度的自适应预测两个模块，这使得预训练模型的提示信息能根据输入图像灵活调整，从而适应不同的伪造图像特性。

Result: IAPL框架在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage两个常用数据集上分别实现了95.61%和96.7%的平均检测精度，达到了先进水平。

Conclusion: IAPL方法通过自适应提示增强了模型的泛化能力，为检测不同伪造成像提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，其在视觉推理任务中的潜力逐渐显现，但其在图像地理定位领域的能力尚未深入探讨。

Method: 提出IMAGEO-Bench基准，涵盖全球街景、美国兴趣点和私有图像数据集，通过测试10种先进的LLMs模型，分析模型表现差异及其推理能力。

Result: 封闭式模型通常表现出更强的推理能力；发现LLMs在高资源地区表现较好，而在资源匮乏地区表现较差，并且成功的地理定位依赖于识别城市环境、标志性地点等因素。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为评估LLMs的空间推理能力提供了科学依据，并对构建具备地理感知能力的人工智能系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

Motivation: 解决G-PCC虽然计算效率高但效果不如深度学习点云压缩方法的问题，提升其效率的同时保持兼容性。

Method: 设计了一种将学习驱动的体素化网络与可微的G-PCC替代模型相结合的预处理框架，通过这两者的联合优化使得网络可以端到端学习和推理。

Result: 在实验中取得了38.84%的平均BD-rate优化，大幅提升了G-PCC性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度学习与传统编码的结合兼顾了性能优化与实际中的设备兼容性，为现有压缩标准的改进提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一種新框架 (CDSR)，僅需平均9張高分辨率圖像即可進行有效的WSI分析，並表現優於其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有多實例學習方法忽視了特徵提取器對特徵表示的影響，特別是預訓練於自然圖像上的特徵提取器會引入域間差距和次優的表示問題。

Method: 提出Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) 框架，通過兩階段選擇性抽樣策略篩選出最具代表性的區域，並利用局部到全局網絡重建WSI的高分辨率空間表徵。

Result: CDSR框架在Camelyon16、TCGA-NSCLC和TCGA-RCC數據集上，僅使用平均7,070張高分辨率影像，達到準確率提高6.3%和ROC曲線下面積提高5.5%的結果，超越使用大量樣本的現有方法。

Conclusion: CDSR框架克服了傳統WSI分析的效率和形態保真度挑戰，在更少數據下提供了卓越的性能，可應用於組織病理學診斷。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Motivation: 目前LVLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但在减少幻觉现象上存在不足，亟需新的方法提升与事实一致的能力。

Method: 本文提出一种名为Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP)的无训练解码方法，从模型隐藏状态的二维语义地图角度，通过层间和层内的注意力机制增强事实一致性，同时通过全局-局部(logit)融合机制进一步提高预测准确性。

Result: 本文方法在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试上，显著提升了LVLMs的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: 提出的地图级解码策略展示了减轻幻觉现象的潜力，为未来多模态模型的改进提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了利用端到端的运动驱动水平集方法（VELA）进行amodal分割的创新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有amodal分割方法依赖于强提示（如可见掩码或边界框）且缺乏几何可解释性，限制了在复杂遮挡场景下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出VELA方法，通过从图像特征及点提示构造初始水平集函数，并通过预测的形状运动场实现逐步的轮廓进化，完成端到端的amodal分割。

Result: 实验结果表明，VELA在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准数据集上的表现优于现有方法，仅需单点提示即可实现优异性能。

Conclusion: 通过几何建模与较弱提示结合，VELA 提高了amodal分割的性能和解释性，为领域提供了一个新颖且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Method: 提出ShapeMoE框架，首先用高斯嵌入表示形状特性，然后通过稀疏路由方法将对象分配给适配的专家处理。

Result: ShapeMoE在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上优于当前先进方法，特别是在遮挡区域分割任务上。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过专注于形状特定的专家分配实现了高效高性能的分割，具有良好的可解释性且具备开放代码潜力。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适配的有效性，表明原用于语音识别的Conformer模型可成功用于关键点为基础的CSLR，并达到新的SOTA性能。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 VFM 在语义分割应用中面临数据规模低及实际分割场景与预训练分布偏移问题，亟需解决。

Method: 设计由 Rein-G 和 Rein-A 组成的 Rein++框架，通过小比例参数调优提高泛化能力，结合无监督域适应策略和语义传递模块提升目标域性能。

Result: 在无需目标标签情况下，Rein++在多样目标领域上表现优异，明显优于现有方法，即便应用于参数规模达十亿级的模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一种高效、通用且适应性强的 VFM 分割解决方案，充分利用少量的数据和域适配达到卓越表现。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Motivation: 当前的视觉模型容易受到对抗性补丁攻击的威胁，但对补丁的空间影响范围缺乏系统研究，因此需要开发工具来揭示这些弱点并推动防御性研究。

Method: 构建了一个称为PatchMap的基准，通过对ImageNet验证集的超过1.5亿次前向传播，全面分析了补丁放置的影响。此外提出了一种基于分割的放置启发式方法，无需梯度查询即可识别脆弱区域。

Result: PatchMap发现小到2%的补丁可引发自信的误分类，并显著降低模型信心。此外，所提方法相比随机或固定位置放置，攻击成功率提高了8到13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap不仅揭示了模型对于特定位置补丁的脆弱性，还为开发更加鲁棒的防御方法和位置感知攻击提供了重要工具，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Prompt-in-Image的新方法，通过将文本指令直接嵌入图像中改进视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs易出现幻觉问题，部分原因是多模态信息未能良好对齐。

Method: 将文本指令嵌入图像中，消除对独立文本输入的需求，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Prompt-in-Image方法提升了Qwen2.5-VL的性能，POPE准确率增加4.1%，降低了MS-COCO上的幻觉率。而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法减小了Qwen的模态间隙，通过单一模态统一了信息处理，从而增强了跨模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在3D编辑中仍存在多视图一致性较差、收敛缓慢及复杂场景处理不佳的问题。

Method: 首先微调3D生成器以适应多视图输入，然后通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后利用高斯Splatting方法将编辑后的多视图结果优化为3D表示。

Result: DisCo3D显著提升了多视图一致性，并在编辑质量上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 采用DisCo3D可以有效增强3D场景的编辑一致性与质量，为3D编辑领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像配准中像素/体素级或区域级对应的问题，并简化操作流程。

Method: 通过使用预训练的分割模型（如SAM），提出一种不需要训练的PromptReg方法，包括引入对应提示问题、逆向提示解决方案，并开发新配准算法。

Result: 在5个应用场景（医疗和非医疗）的实验中，该方法在Dice和目标配准误差等指标上优于传统和基于学习的方法，甚至与弱监督方法表现接近。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过改进区域级匹配过程，实现了无需训练的高效图像配准，其性能具有竞争力且计算流程更加简化。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在自动高质量视频生成上表现优秀，但对于给定首尾帧和描述性文本生成合乎逻辑的视频过渡仍然不足。

Method: 提出VTG框架，使用插值初始化、双向运动微调及表示对齐正则化，以改进运动平滑性和生成保真性。

Conclusion: VTG在生成高保真、平滑且语义连贯的视频过渡中取得成功，并可作为统一过渡生成研究的基础。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as

coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

*Jia-Chen Zhang,Yu-Jie Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为EST-LoRA的自适应LoRA融合方法，无需训练即可实现风格与内容的平衡，生成效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA融合方法难以在风格和内容间取得平衡，且通常需要额外训练。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA方法，通过结合矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长等因素，实现动态选择并融合主题和风格LoRA，类似专家混合架构(MoE)。

Result: 实验表明，EST-LoRA能够在定性和定量评估中超越最新的方法，并提高生成速度。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA无需训练即可平衡主题与风格贡献，为高效生成任务提供了改进的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

TL;DR: 提出TimeExpert模型，旨在改进视频时序定位任务的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案未能区分不同任务所需的特定处理路径，影响性能。

Method: 采用基于专家混合(MoE)的动态路由机制，将特定任务的标记分配给专家模块,进行分任务处理。

Result: TimeExpert模型在稠密视频描述、时刻检索及视频亮点检测等多项任务中达到了最新的表现水平。

Conclusion: 通过动态路由和任务分解有效提高了视频时序定位任务的模型表现效率和精度，为多个应用场景提供了改进的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LT-Gaussian的地图更新方法，专注于提高基于3D-Gaussian Splatting地图的更新效率和质量，实验表明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于生成高质量3D场景需要高时间和计算成本，地图的更新成为自动驾驶中一个关键挑战。

Method: LT-Gaussian方法包括三部分：多模态Gaussian Splatting、结构变化检测模块以及Gaussian-Map更新模块。这些模块协同作用完成地图的生成和更新。

Result: 方法在nuScenes数据集上测试，结果证明LT-Gaussian能够高效处理典型的环境变化，并生成高质量的地图更新。

Conclusion: 与从零重建地图的策略相比，LT-Gaussian通过综合新旧场景信息实现更高效和高质量的地图更新。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

TL;DR: GAID框架通过细粒度的时序对齐和文本嵌入扰动方法改进了文本到视频的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略音频语义或采用粗略的融合策略，导致多模态表示效果不佳。

Method: 提出了两个核心组件：帧级门控融合（FGF）和方向性自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别用于融合彩音特征和增强文本嵌入的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MSR-VTT、DiDeMo、LSMDC和VATEX数据集上的实验结果优于当前技术水平，并在效率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: GAID通过减少模态差距和正则化跨模态匹配，提升了文本与视频检索的表达能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of
multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing

video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments
labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting,
Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our
three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement
(Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark
performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful

Motivation: 解决静态数据集模型在动态手术环境中表现受限的问题，并实现手术场景下的新类别适应和增量语义分割。

Method: 改进TOPICS方法，加入Dice损失处理类别不平衡，引入分层伪标签策略，并设计了适用于手术机器人的标签分类法。同时构建了六个专为手术场景设计的CISS基准，以及144类改进标签的Syn-Mediverse数据集用于评估。

Result: 实现了一个公开的代码库及训练模型，并提供了新的CISS基准和改进的手术场景语义分割方法。

Conclusion: 改进后的TOPICS+能够更好地适应动态手术场景中语义分割需求，有助于提高机器人辅助手术的实时场景理解能力。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LVLMs对象幻觉问题的本质及其原因，改善模型对视觉和文本模态的整体理解能力。

Method: 通过干预和调整文本与视觉标记的注意力权重，提出一种无训练方法，同时采用对比解码策略减少对参数化知识的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减轻了LVLMs的模态偏置与对象幻觉问题，具有广泛的适用性和高效性。

Conclusion: 提出的新方法显著改进了LVLMs处理多模态信息的能力，展示了解决对象幻觉问题的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型因层级架构的优势表现出色，但模型中具体视觉概念的编码位置难以确定，需要新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出GCC方法，迭代性地评估神经元间的连接性，聚焦功能依赖性和语义对齐，自动发现与查询相关的多个概念电路。

Result: GCC不仅可以捕捉与查询相关的特定概念，还首次实现了细粒度层面对特定视觉概念的电路识别。

Conclusion: GCC方法在多种深度图像分类模型上验证了其通用性和有效性，对模型的概念层级解释提供了深刻见解。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分考虑外观和运动线索的时空交互，导致跟踪性能欠佳。

Method: 设计了AMC矩阵和MTC模块，分别实现外观-运动一致性计算和未匹配轨迹的重激活。

Result: 在VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV三大基准中表现优于当前最先进方法，同时具有即插即用与免训练的优势。

Conclusion: AMOT显著改善了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能，可为相关领域的应用提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Motivation: 现有的遥感基础模型主要基于光学图像预训练，多光谱/高光谱数据缺少相应的模型支持。作者希望探索如何在无需大量光谱预训练的情况下，利用现有模型处理多光谱数据。

Method: 提出了一个参数高效的微调框架SpectralX，包括两个阶段：第一阶段利用Hyper Tokenizer提取空间和光谱特征，并通过Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter完成层级微调；第二阶段在进行语义分割任务时利用Attribute-refined Adapter细化模型。

Conclusion: SpectralX框架充分发挥了现有遥感基础模型的潜力，为跨领域的光谱图像处理提供了有效工具，无需从零开始对多光谱数据进行大量预训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian框架提供了一种更简洁高效的语义感知3D高斯表示方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨细调的开源视觉语言模型可能通过基础模型遗留弱点暴露于可转移的攻击中。

Method: 提出SEA攻击方法，包括Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation（FTS）和Targeted Prompt Guidance（TPG）技术，用于生成易转移的对抗样本和目标文本输出。

Result: 实验表明，在Qwen2-VL上SEA的攻击成功率超过86.5%，且毒性率接近49.5%，突显继承性漏洞的显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，需针对开源模型遗留的漏洞采取综合防御，以保障细调专有VLMs的安全。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Conclusion: INSIGHT模型在长期动作预测任务中展示了其创新性，通过引入细粒度视觉特征和认知推理显著提升了性能，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Motivation: 当前差分隐私数据生成需要大量数据，而数据蒸馏技术虽能提高效率，但现有方法噪声过多，无法高效利用私密信息。

Method: 提出一种新的框架，解耦采样与优化过程，并通过在信息子空间的匹配减轻DP噪声的影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，使用每类50张图片的情况下，本方法相较于现有最佳方法提升了10%的性能，使用五分之一数据集大小时性能提高了8.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著改善了在差分隐私前提下数据蒸馏技术的训练效率及合成数据质量，拓展了隐私保护技术的潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个基于多摄像头、实时跟踪的系统，用于室内奶牛活动的精准监测，此系统运用了先进的计算机视觉算法，具有高精确度和低误差率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奶牛活动与健康和福利密切相关，但人工观察和评估效率低且不一致，因此需要一个高效的实时监测系统。

Method: 采用多摄像头和先进的计算机视觉技术，包括YOLO11-m模型和升级后的SAMURAI用于实例分割，结合运动感知的线性卡尔曼滤波器和IoU方式进行实时跟踪。

Result: 系统在多目标跟踪精度(MOTA)达到98.7%和99.3%，IDF1超过99%，且身份切换接近零。

Conclusion: 该系统能够在复杂的室内环境中跟踪奶牛活动，减少冗余检测并提高疾病早期预测的可能性。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN)的新导航范式，使用用户提供的视觉提示在2D顶部视图地图中引导机器人导航，避免了自然语言的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决语言导航中由于自然语言的模糊性和冗长性对复杂环境中导航代理的影响，为用户提供更加直观、简单的导航方式。

Method: 通过视觉提示进行导航，且无语言指令干预，还提出专用的基线网络VPNet，结合视角级和轨迹级数据增强策略，提高导航性能。

Result: 在VPN任务中，分析不同视觉提示形式、地图格式及数据增强策略对导航性能的影响，且在构建的新数据集R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: VPN提供了一种直观且空间贴切的导航方式，适合非专业用户使用，且有效减少了语言解析的歧义问题。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiffSemanticFusion框架，将语义栅格和高清地图扩散模块结合，用于提高自动驾驶情景中的轨迹预测和规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的栅格表示缺乏几何精度，而图形表示在没有精确地图的情况下不够稳定，作者希望利用两者的优势提升在线高清地图生成表现。

Method: 提出了一种名为DiffSemanticFusion的框架，将语义栅格融合鸟瞰图(BEV)，并引入地图扩散模块，加强在线高清地图表示的稳定性和表现力。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集中，DiffSemanticFusion分别在轨迹预测任务和端到端自动驾驶任务中取得5.1%和15%的性能提升。

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion通过改进在线高清地图表示的稳定性和表现力，同时可无缝集成其他基于矢量的方法，显著提升自动驾驶相关任务的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

*Xiaotong Zhang,Alexander Broersen,Gonnie CM van Erp,Silvia L. Pintea,Jouke Dijkstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的基于点的Couinaud分割方法，不需要提前获知肝脏血管结构，且效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中基于点的表示方式虽然能保留CT的物理分辨率，但需要手动先验的肝脏血管结构，这耗时且复杂，需要改进。

Method: 利用一种图推理模块学习肝脏血管的解剖结构，在点特征上添加隐式解剖信息，无需明确提供先验结构。

Result: 方法在MSD和LiTS公共数据集的Dice系数和平均表面距离上与四种先进方法相比表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的基于点的Couinaud分割方法有效且高效，代码已公开供验证和复现。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种基于扩散和物理增强的3D手部运动恢复框架，以提高视频中的运动估计精度，特别是在手物体交互场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D手部重建在单目图像中已有进展，但在视频中生成准确且时间一致的运动估计仍面临挑战，特别是在手物体交互场景中。

Method: 提出一种扩散模型，与物理增强结合进行运动修正；模型通过去噪过程生成改进的序列，并根据运动捕捉数据而非视频数据进行训练，同时融入物理直觉知识（如关键运动状态和约束）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改进了多种实时重建方法，达到了现有基准的SOTA（最先进）性能。

Conclusion: 通过将扩散模型与物理增强结合，提出的框架在手物体交互的复杂场景中表现卓越，能够生成更精确时间一致的3D手部运动估计。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单的代数方法，通过已知平面目标框架下的参考点坐标和相机框架中对应的方位测量，估计相机相对于平面目标的姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相机如何通过已知坐标点和测量信息，精确估计平面目标的相对位姿的问题。

Method: 采用层次结构，依次确定目标平面法向量、相机位置矢量、与目标平面的距离及完整的方向，并结合平均化方法提高抗噪性。

Result: 通过广泛的实验验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的代数方法能够精确和鲁棒地估计相机的相对位姿，抗噪性能良好。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: OmniEvent提出了一个统一的事件表示学习框架，在多个数据集和任务上超越了最先进的表现，解决了事件数据传统模型的任务特定设计局限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机应用受空间和时间不均匀性影响，现有模型需要针对特定任务优化，缺乏通用性。

Method: 通过“解耦-增强-融合”方法，独立处理空间和时间域的局部特征并用注意力机制融合，同时利用占空间填充曲线提升计算效率，生成网格张量以支持标准视觉模型。

Result: OmniEvent在三个任务和十个数据集上提升了性能，其中相比最先进模型性能提高高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent成功实现了统一的事件学习框架，不再需要特定任务的模型设计，同时大幅度提升了综合性能。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in
https://github.com/Wickyan/OmniEvent .

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

TL;DR: 提出了上下文引导Transformer (CGT) 模型，通过时间上下文重采样和加权的空间上下文依赖，降低计算成本且提高视频压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件熵模型在利用时间上下文时增加了计算复杂性，同时空间上下文的顺序依赖未被充分建模，限制了解码中的上下文可用性。

Method: 提出CGT模型，利用transformer编码器进行时间上下文重采样，以及基于师生网络明确建模空间上下文依赖顺序，通过选取权重最高的上下文预测未解码的token。

Result: CGT模型减少了约65%的熵建模时间，并相比现有条件熵模型实现了11%的BD-Rate降低。

Conclusion: CGT在保持精度的同时，有效减小了时间和空间上下文建模的复杂性，对视频压缩效果提升显著。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

Motivation: 弥补视觉搜索研究中在现实场景适用性和广泛性方面的不足。

Method: 进行36名参与者的用户研究，应用眼动与脑电特征开发分类方法，并评估在140种现实场景中的普适性。

Result: 新方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%准确率，大幅超越现有基于跳跃潜力的56.9%准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了在现实场景中区分目标与非目标注视点的能力，并验证了方法的普适性。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF框架有效增强了深伪检测的精度和细粒度定位能力，证明了其在检测性能和模型可解释性方面的综合优势。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Result: 在实时性和长视频理解任务上，实现了对现有方法的超越，既提高了响应准确性，又提升了实时效率。

Conclusion: StreamAgent展示了其在实际流媒体场景中的潜在应用价值，改善了主动决策和实时性能。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种公开可用的DICOM数据集与评估框架，用于评估医学影像去身份化流程的有效性，从而促进更安全和更一致的医学影像共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像研究需要大量数据共享以提高再现性并训练AI模型，但如何确保患者隐私却是一个重大挑战，特别是在公开访问的数据共享中。现有去身份化工具普遍缺乏有效性评估，影响了再现性及监管信心。

Method: 研究开发了MIDI数据集，一个包含合成PHI/PII的信息的DICOM数据集，以及相关评估框架。数据集从TCIA公开数据生成，模拟了实际身份泄露情况，评估框架包括Python脚本、答案密钥和映射文件，并符合HIPAA隐私规则和DICOM保密性规定。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个促进医学影像安全共享的工具，支持基于标准的评估，有望提升去身份化流程的一致性与可靠性。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known

TL;DR: EgoTrigger通过智能音频触发相机，节省54%能耗，同时保持类似人类记忆增强任务的性能，推动全天候使用的节能智能眼镜发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前全天候智能眼镜面临能耗和多模态AI集成的挑战，亟需一种高效的传感器管理方案以实现人类记忆增强。

Method: 提出EgoTrigger系统，通过轻量级音频模型（如YAMNet）识别手-物交互（HOI）音频提示，选择性触发功耗高的摄像头进行图像采集。

Result: 实验证明EgoTrigger平均使用54%更少的帧，显著节省了相机和后续操作的能耗，同时在情节记忆任务上达到了可比的性能。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger的情境感知触发策略为全天候能源高效的智能眼镜提供了新方向，有望支持例如帮助用户回忆日常活动等实际应用。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

*Conor Wallace,Isaac Corley,Jonathan Lwowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了统一视觉-语言模型（VLM）在工业检测中的实际应用效果，结果显示，尽管这种方法在理论上具有吸引力，但现阶段VLM仍存在视觉基础薄弱及鲁棒性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化工业检测流程，解决传统检测模型在复杂度、效率和维护上的不足。

Method: 通过分析基于Florence-2的InspectVLM模型，该模型使用新的大规模多模态多任务数据集InspectMM进行训练，并对其在不同检测任务中的表现进行评估。

Result: InspectVLM在图像分类和结构化关键点任务上表现良好，但在核心检测指标上逊于传统的基于ResNet的模型。此外，它对提示变化的鲁棒性差，在精细目标检测中输出退化，且常常忽略视觉输入而依赖记忆化的语言输出。

Conclusion: 尽管语言驱动的统一框架理论上简洁优雅，但当前的VLM并不足以满足精密工业检测的要求，尚需在视觉基础和模型鲁棒性上改进。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为DBOM的新框架，用于识别和中和深度神经网络中因多种触发器注入的后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络(DNNs)和生成式AI(GenAI)面对后门攻击的脆弱性，尤其是针对多触发器和未见过的后门配置案例。

Method: 提出DBOM框架，通过使用视觉语言模型(VLMs)的结构性分解，将输入图像的触发器和对象表示为独立的嵌入空间元素。引入触发器-对象分离和多样性损失，以及自适应提示词调优方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，DBOM能够在CIFAR-10和GTSRB数据集上检测出被污染的图像，并在下游训练前显著提高DNN训练流水线的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM框架能够通过解耦触发器与对象的表示，以零次学习的方式有效识别和中和潜在的后门攻击，为应用安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-altitude camera pose estimation system, addressing
the challenges of robust and accurate localization across varied altitudes when

transformer, deep features, and structure-from-motion into a unified framework.
To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly
collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose
estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in
both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks
compared to existing solutions, making it well suited for real-world robotic
applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated

TL;DR: 本文研究通过对YOLOv5和YOLOv8骨干网络进行对比自监督学习（SSL）预训练，以减少对大规模标注数据依赖，并在低标注数据下实现较高的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一阶段目标检测器如YOLO在实时视觉应用中表现优秀，但训练需要大量标注数据，而本研究希望通过SSL预训练减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 提出了一种利用SimCLR框架的管道，通过全局池化和对比损失优化，将COCO未标注数据集用于预训练YOLO检测器的骨干网络，并使用有限标注数据对自行车检测任务进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，SSL预训练显著提升了mAP、收敛速度以及精准-召回率性能，特别是在低标注数据情况下如YOLOv8模型的mAP@50:95达到了0.7663，超过其监督学习对应模型。

Conclusion: 研究展示了对比SSL在一阶段目标检测器上的优势，并突出了未标注数据作为可扩展资源在高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提高了非视线成像效率，促进了实时高分辨率成像的实现，并扩展了其在轻量设备上的应用范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Conclusion: 本文提出了新的方法有效解决了图像生成过程中的冲突和权衡问题，可更好地反映用户提供的复杂图像提示。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM建立了一个集高层推理、中层仿真执行和低层实际执行为一体的分层评估框架，为ADVLM的闭环测试和诊断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

TL;DR: Protego是一种用于保护用户面部图像隐私的新方法，通过动态变形和掩盖面部特征，有效抵御基于面部识别的隐私入侵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有面部识别技术对隐私造成的严重威胁，尤其是通过服务如Clearview AI实现的非自愿身份推断及私人内容披露问题，迫切需要一种用户友好型的隐私保护方案。

Method: Protego将用户3D面部特征转化为二维表现，并动态变形成自然外观的3D面部遮罩，以在图像分享前保护用户面孔。它还结合敏感性增强技术，使受保护的图像不可比对。

Result: Protego能显著降低许多黑盒模型的图像检索准确率，性能至少比现有方法高出两倍，同时在视觉一致性和自然表现，特别是视频场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: Protego是一种大大减少面部识别滥用和不必要身份追踪问题的创新工具，且为隐私保护领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

Result: 实验表明DINOv2模型在交通标志以及其他街景元素识别中优于现有的视觉-语言模型。

Conclusion: 该数据集为改进自动驾驶场景下的感知系统提供了可靠、可解释且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于分布式多阶段图像压缩的层级级联框架（HCF），提高了压缩性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临逐级压缩效率低、累积质量损失以及固定参数模型灵活性不足等问题。

Method: 通过直接在潜在空间中进行变换引入HCF框架，同时提出了基于策略驱动的量化控制和边缘量化原则来优化码率失真权衡。

Result: 与逐级压缩相比，HCF在CLIC数据集上PSNR BD-Rate的性能提高了5.56%，且显著减少了计算资源消耗；与现有渐进压缩方法相比，Kodak数据集上BD-Rate性能提升12.64%。

Conclusion: HCF框架显著提升了分布式多阶段图像压缩中的码率失真表现及计算效率，同时支持跨质量自适应压缩，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为StarPose的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过结合历史3D预测和时空物理指导，显著提升了预测的准确性和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前单目3D姿态估计存在深度模糊和遮挡问题，现有方法无法有效利用时空相关性，导致时序一致性差和精度不足。

Method: 提出了StarPose，一个自回归扩散框架，通过历史姿态整合模块（HPIM）结合预测的3D姿态和2D输入，生成历史姿态信息，并引入时空物理指导（STPG）机制优化去噪过程，强化姿态的解剖合理性和运动动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，StarPose在多项基准数据集上超越了现有最先进方法，表现出更高的准确性和时序一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过创新性地整合历史预测信息和时空指导，解决了传统3D人体姿态估计方法的关键限制，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种为胸部X线图像生成结构化报告的新方法，包括构建数据集和引入专门评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在信息冗余和语言不一致的问题，而结构化报告能够提供标准化和简洁的解决方案。

Method: 通过创建包含疾病名称、严重程度、概率和解剖位置的MIMIC-STRUC数据集，并训练基于大语言模型（LLM）的生成模型。同时提出一种新的专门评价指标S-Score。

Result: 该方法能生成标准化的高质量报告，并引入的S-Score可以更好地评估报告的临床相关性与质量。

Conclusion: 通过强调结构化报告的有效性及其评价的重要性，该方法提供了一种更符合临床决策的报告质量评估方式。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Method: 设计了VLM4D基准，包括真实和合成视频及相关问答，重点测试模型的平移、旋转、视角觉知及运动连续性，评估现有模型的性能，并探讨4D特征场重建和针对性时空监督微调的改进方向。

Result: 揭示了现有视觉语言模型在整合多视觉线索、保持时空连贯性方面的显著问题，且与人类基准存在明显的性能差距。

Conclusion: 当前的视觉语言模型在动态时空推理中存在基础性缺陷，需要进一步探讨与改进模型的空间和时间感知能力，以提升其在动态环境中的智能表现。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模图像生成模型难于参数微调，而低秩适配（LoRA）尽管参数开销较小但存在分布式应用挑战限制了实用性。

Method: 提出一个框架，包括基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，和计算上下文特定的融合权重的细粒度门控融合机制，用于优化多LoRA模块的集成。

Result: 显著提升了图像生成性能，实现了基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 工作为分布式LoRA模块的开发和标准化适配整合实现桥梁化，促进了协作模型的演进与实用化。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

Method: 提出一种分层框架，结合局部增强的状态空间模型以及长短程相关性捕获，利用不同步长采样模式提高光晕移除能力，同时保持细节和全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，DeflareMamba能够有效去除多种光晕伪影（包括散射光晕和反射光晕），并在物体识别和跨模态语义理解中表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba展现了在光晕移除任务中的创新能力，并提升了图像处理的整体效果。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 复杂光照条件可能导致反射等干扰，RGB或事件数据单一模态难以有效应对，且缺乏无需额外传感器的解决方法。本文旨在利用几何线索提升检测鲁棒性。

Method: 设计NRE-Net框架，融合单目预测法线图、RGB图像和事件数据；引入自适应双流融合模块(ADFM)和事件模态感知融合模块(EAFM)优化模态间的整合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net相较先进方法，在mAP50指标上分别提升了7.9%和6.1%，并超越融合方法SFNet和SODFormer。

Conclusion: 证明了结合法线图、RGB和事件数据在复杂环境中提升目标检测精度的有效性，并为多模态融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Conclusion: 本研究克服了动态城市场景建模中处理时间不连续性和快速移动物体建模的难点，为高保真新视图合成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法不能有效捕捉渲染图像中显著的感知差异。

Method: 设计了一个紧凑的多层感知机(MLP)，在包含真实测量和生成合成数据的数据集上进行训练，并以感知验证的图像空间度量为标签数据，直接评估BRDF感知质量。

Result: 该神经网络度量方法与人类感知判断的相关性显著提高，但在BRDF拟合的损失函数表现上仍有限。

Conclusion: 这种基于感知的度量提供了一个有基础的替代方法来评估BRDF模型质量。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

Conclusion: Free-MoRef在处理长视频任务时，以较低的计算成本和即刻响应的能力，实现了显著的性能提升和推理效率提升，展示了其在长视频理解场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有高精地图成本高，易过时，且不易维护，为此研究利用可扩展的航拍图像替代方案。

Method: 通过SLAM技术和点云地图，将航拍影像与nuScenes数据集的局部坐标系统精准对齐，并采用校正流程和人工审核提高对齐质量。并以在线地图构建和运动预测两项任务展示其实用性。

Result: 实验表明，航拍影像提升了地图构建精度15-23%，运动预测表现提高2%。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了航拍影像具备作为环境信息替代方案的潜力，尤其适用于高精地图不可用或维护成本高的情境，同时公开的AID4AD数据集将支持更多相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Conclusion: TrackletGait框架在真实场景步态识别中表现出色，提供了一个更鲁棒和有效的识别方法。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

TL;DR: AURORA框架通过链式思维引导增强语义推理和语言理解，同时引入分割特征蒸馏损失确保分割性能，取得了Ref-AVS任务中的最新性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，常依赖固定推理模式，且推理与分割的联合训练可能削弱像素级精度。

Method: 引入链式思维(CoT)的逐步推理机制及新型分割特征蒸馏损失，同时设计两阶段训练策略，包括反思式自我修正训练阶段和基于群体奖励的强化学习优化。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中取得了最新性能，且在未参考分割任务上展现了良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过增强模型推理能力和分割性能，AURORA在Ref-AVS任务和相关任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了AttriCtrl，一种用于精确和持续控制图像生成中美学属性的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型难以对美学属性进行精细调整，现有方法受限于模糊文本提示或昂贵的人类偏好数据。

Method: 提出AttriCtrl框架，通过预训练视觉语言模型量化抽象美学，使用轻量化数值编码器将标量强度映射为可学习嵌入，集成到扩散生成中。

Result: 实验表明，AttriCtrl在个性化美学属性控制和多属性组合上表现优越，同时兼容主流开源框架。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl能够以轻量化方式实现直观且灵活的美学操控，适配性强，适用于多种生成场景。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在提高收敛速度、减少对参数选择的依赖方面具有显著优势，并能够更有效地处理带噪图像。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Conclusion: DreamPainter在电商场景的背景生成中提供了更高的效果和控制精度，表明多模态信号结合可显著提升生成任务的表现。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Conclusion: 该方法增强了基于RGB的类别级姿势估计性能，同时提高了系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了复杂光照情景下图像恢复的准确性和鲁棒性，迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS等基准上的实验表现出GaussianCross效率和准确性上的显著提升，包括在线性微调和小规模数据训练的情形下优于现有方法，同时在全参数调整方面亦显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: GaussianCross是一个创新且有效的跨模态自监督3D表示学习模型，在多方面表现出优异性能，并验证了其在3D场景理解中的卓越应用潜力。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: ZOA框架有效缓解了量化模型因域移导致的性能退化问题，能显著提升其鲁棒性和泛化能力，且开销极低。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The
source code is available at https://github.com/DengZeshuai/ZOA.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

### [182] [CMIC: Content-Adaptive Mamba for Learned Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02192)
*Yunuo Chen,Zezheng Lyu,Bing He,Hongwei Hu,Qi Wang,Yuan Tian,Li Song,Wenjun Zhang,Guo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种新的基于Mamba模型的图像压缩方法，称为内容自适应Mamba (CAM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba风格模型在图像压缩中存在固定扫描顺序，无法很好地动态适应内容的依赖性。

Method: 通过内容感知的标记重组和全局先验提示字典，改进了Mamba模型中的依赖捕获能力，同时保持线性计算效率。

Result: 在Kodak、Tecnick和CLIC数据集上的BD-rate分别降低了15.91%、21.34%和17.58%，超越了VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: 引入CAM显著改进了全球依赖捕获能力，同时在率失真性能上取得了显著的效果提升。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出COSFormer，一个基于Transformer的持续学习框架，用于多任务的全切片图像（WSI）分析，显著提高了模型的资源效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全切片图像在临床和医院中的使用迅速增加，需要一种能高效处理和适应新任务的持续学习系统，而无需对先前任务进行重新训练或微调。

Method: 提出COSFormer，基于Transformer设计，支持从新任务中顺序学习，同时避免重新访问完整的历史数据集，并进行类增量和任务增量实验验证。

Result: 在七个WSI数据集和六个任务的多任务设置下，COSFormer在类增量和任务增量场景下表现出优越的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: COSFormer为临床应用中的持续WSI分析提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于事件流的单一积分（ESI）方法，用于实现实时高帧率的强度图像重建，尤其适合无人机在极端光照条件下的视觉跟踪任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对事件相机的异步事件流如何高效处理及利用的问题，提出解决方案以实现机载任务。

Method: 通过单一积分结合增强衰减算法从事件流中重建强度图像，确保适应帧基视觉方法的同时具备实时性和高帧率。

Result: 实验结果表明，ESI算法相比现有方法具有显著的运行效率提升、更高的重建质量和100 FPS的高帧率。低光环境实测中，ESI表现优异，而其它方法因帧率或性能限制失败。

Conclusion: ESI算法显著提升无人机在视觉挑战环境下的机载感知水平，具有较低计算负担，为实时视觉任务提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于动态缓存机制的泰勒预测方法，用于加速Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) 的推理速度，显著提升了计算效率且仅带来轻微质量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiTs在生成视觉任务上的推理速度较慢，难以应用于低资源场景；现有方法在加速时存在内存和计算开销较大及预测准确性不足的问题。

Method: 方法通过将预测目标从模块级转向最后一个块级，从而减少缓存特征数量；利用Transformer块之间的强依赖性，用第一个块的预测误差作为信任指标，动态调整缓存机制。

Result: 实验证明该方法可在几乎无质量下降的情况下，实现FLUX 3.17倍加速，DiT 2.36倍加速，Wan Video 4.14倍加速。

Conclusion: 提出的动态缓存泰勒预测方法有效缓解了现有DiTs加速方法的内存开销问题，提升推理速度的同时保证了生成质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多模态实体链接方法，通过文本优先处理和多轮迭代策略整合视觉信息，改进了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服当前多模态实体链接方法中不必要的图像数据使用和单一视觉特征提取的局限，提升其性能和准确性。

Method: 提出了一种名为“跨模态及其内部协同反思”的框架，在文本不足的情况下，采用多轮迭代整合图像的关键视觉信息，提升任务推理和匹配准确性。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公共数据集上进行的实验表明，该框架在任务性能上分别提高了3.2%、5.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著超越现有顶尖方法，证明了框架在多模态实体链接任务中的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种称为DerProp的半监督语义分割框架，通过导数标签传播方法改进伪标签可靠性，并在实验中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中伪标签可靠性不足的问题，从而缓解标注负担。

Method: 引入导数标签传播方法，对像素特征向量施以离散导数操作作为额外正则化，约束解空间，优化相似性度量。

Result: 实验验证了设计的合理性，并证明该方法优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的DerProp框架有效增强了伪标签的可靠性，为半监督语义分割提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态RAG框架Patho-AgenticRAG，通过使用权威病理学教材的页面嵌入，支持文本与图像的联合检索，显著提升复杂病理诊断任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前病理学中VLMs存在易产生幻觉的问题，这主要源于病理场景中的高分辨率图像、复杂组织结构以及临床语义的细微差异。此外，现有RAG方法主要依赖文本知识库，难以有效利用诊断视觉线索。

Method: Patho-AgenticRAG利用权威病理学教材页面的嵌入建立数据库，实现了支持文本与图像联合检索的多模态RAG框架。同时，该方法还支持推理、任务分解以及多轮搜索交互，以应对复杂诊断场景。

Result: 实验表明，Patho-AgenticRAG在复杂病理任务如多选诊断和视觉问答中，显著优于现有多模态模型。

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过结合文本与相关图像的直接检索，有效避免了关键信息的丢失，其多模态检索能力增强了病理学任务中的诊断和推理表现。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the
Patho-AgenticRAG repository:

TL;DR: SplatSSC 提出了一种新方法，用于单目 3D 语义场景补全，通过深度引导初始化策略和高斯聚合器，比之前的方式提升性能并降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目 3D 语义场景补全任务是一个具有挑战性但前景光明的研究方向，目前的方法效率不足且容易产生错误伪影。

Method: SplatSSC 的方法包括基于深度引导的高斯初始策略（Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion 模块）和解耦高斯聚合器，分别处理几何和语义预测，搭配专用损失函数优化。

Result: 该方法在 Occ-ScanNet 数据集上表现优异，与现有方法相比，IoU 提高超过 6.3%，mIoU 提高 4.1%，并降低了 9.3% 以上的延迟和内存消耗。

Conclusion: SplatSSC 提供了一种高效且准确的单目 3D 场景补全解决方案，并显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Hermes，这是一种用于超声图像分类和分割的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，通过结合对比学习和半监督学习的优点，利用伪标签提高任务性能，并通过跨任务一致性学习减少特征差异性。实验结果表明其优于多种现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前半监督对比学习中伪标签选择容易产生过度自信且错误的预测，同时分类与分割任务独立处理未充分利用两者之间的关联性，作者旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一个结合对比学习和半监督学习的策略，设计跨任务注意力和显著性模块增强任务间信息共享，并通过跨任务一致性学习对齐不同任务下肿瘤特征。此外，作者收集了一个新的甲状腺超声图像数据集SZ-TUS进行实验验证。

Result: Hermes方法在两个公开超声数据集和一个私有数据集上的广泛实验中，在多种半监督设置下均优于几种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过伪标签辅助对比学习，设计模块促进分类与分割任务的协作，有效提高了超声图像的分类与分割性能，并证明其方法的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于区域到点匹配(A2PM)的研究虽提升了匹配精度，但受限于效率低和复杂的图匹配方法，难以扩展。

Method: SGAD通过生成高分辨率的区域描述符并采用新的监督策略，将区域匹配问题分解为分类和排序子任务，同时引入层次包含冗余滤波(HCRF)来消除区域重叠。

Result: SGAD实现了显著性能提升，相较于MESA减少了60倍运行时间，同时在多种匹配器中表现出色，例如户外姿态估计中比DKM更快且准确性更高，并在室内姿态估计上超越了最新的性能基准。

Conclusion: SGAD在局部特征匹配领域显著提升了精度和效率，成为该领域新标杆。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new

Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量计算资源和数据集，本研究旨在探讨边缘增强图像的预处理是否能改进基础模型在跨模态医学影像分割中的表现。

Method: 将基础模型分别使用原始图像和边缘增强图像进行预训练，然后在特定医疗模态的原始图像子集上微调，并提出基于图像标准差和熵的元学习策略，选择最优模型以提升分割性能。

Result: 结合元学习策略，与仅使用边缘增强数据或原始数据进行预训练的模型相比，分割性能分别提升了16.42%和19.30%。

Conclusion: 适当地结合边缘增强预训练与元学习策略有助于提高医学图像分割的整体性能，但需针对不同模态选择性地应用该方法。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Motivation: 解决基于激光雷达和RGB相机在高速场景中感知能力不足的问题，同时进一步挖掘事件相机在连续时间检测中的潜能。

Method: 设计了全新的立体3D目标检测框架，仅依赖于事件相机工作，并引入双过滤机制和基于目标的边界框对齐技术来提升语义、几何信息提取和回归能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境下性能优于现有方法，展示出事件相机在连续时间3D感知中应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过创新方法，成功展示了事件相机在不依赖传统3D传感器下进行高效、鲁棒的3D物体检测能力，为动态感知提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练策略Confident Meta-learning (CoMet)，可在标注噪声且无需手动数据筛选的环境中提升异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法假设所有训练数据均为正常样本，但这一假设需要对数据进行人工筛选，存在局限性。研究旨在消除这一限制，以便模型能够适应含噪声数据集。

Method: 提出CoMet方法，将Soft Confident Learning和元学习相结合。Soft Confident Learning对低置信度样本赋予较低权重，元学习通过正则化基于训练-验证损失协方差的更新稳定训练过程。

Result: 实验表明，在MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, KSDD2数据集及两种先进模型上，CoMet方法可稳定提升基线方法性能，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并在所有数据集上设置了新的性能标准。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种高效且模型无关的异常检测训练方法，无需明确过滤数据样本，增强模型对含噪声数据集的鲁棒性。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all

### [195] [Whole-body Representation Learning For Competing Preclinical Disease Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02307)
*Dmitrii Seletkov,Sophie Starck,Ayhan Can Erdur,Yundi Zhang,Daniel Rueckert,Rickmer Braren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种全身自监督表征学习方法，用于基于竞争风险模型的临床前疾病风险评估，结果显示在多种疾病的预测中优于全身放射组学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图像的风险预测算法通常仅考虑单一疾病，并依赖手工提取的分割特征。此研究的动机是设计一种更通用和高效的方法来进行风险评估。

Method: 提出了一种基于全身自监督表征学习的方法，在竞争风险模型下实现临床前疾病风险评估，并结合多模态数据进一步提高特定疾病子组的预测能力。

Result: 该方法在心血管疾病（CVD）、2型糖尿病（T2D）、慢性阻塞性肺病（COPD）及慢性肾病（CKD）等多种疾病中表现优越，并能在模拟临床前筛查和结合心脏MRI的情况下，进一步细化心血管疾病子类别的风险预测。

Conclusion: 全身表征学习方法具有独立筛查潜力，同时在临床工作流程中作为多模态框架的一部分，为早期个性化风险分层提供支持。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Motivation: 探索如何在临床AI应用中利用模型的不确定性量化，提高其对复杂决策的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 就一个大规模眼科数据集构建评估研究，比较学习型转交模型与不确定性量化方法在分布内外数据上的表现。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在转交决策中表现出了较高的潜力，尤其是在分布外数据上具有更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI决策转交的一种更可行且鲁棒的选择，值得进一步研究与应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

*Gefan Ye,Lin Li,Kexin Li,Jun Xiao,Long chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LogicCAR的框架，通过引入两种符号约束来解决视频中动词-物体组合的零样本组合动作识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本组合动作识别方法面临两个主要挑战：缺乏组合结构约束和语义层级约束，导致虚假关联以及语义模糊性，对训练造成影响。

Method: 提出LogicCAR框架，通过显式组合逻辑和层级原语逻辑的双重符号约束建模，并将这些约束形式化为一阶逻辑内嵌至神经网络架构中。

Result: 在Sth-com数据集上的实验结果证明，LogicCAR优于现有方法，并显示出逻辑驱动约束的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将符号抽象与现有模型相结合，LogicCAR有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Motivation: 现有体素场景重建方法表现出色，但通常需要昂贵的3D地面实况或多视角监督，提出一种既省资源又能保持效果的新方法。

Method: 利用预训练的2D扩散模型和深度预测模型，从单个图像生成合成的场景几何，并用其进行模型蒸馏以训练单视图场景重建模型。

Result: 在KITTI-360和Waymo数据集上达到或超越需要多视角监督的最新基线，并提供了动态场景处理上的独特优势。

Conclusion: 本文方法在无需昂贵监督的情况下实现高效场景重建，并在动态场景处理等方面展现独特优越性。

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad
range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric
reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require
expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage
pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate
synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill
a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 提出Qwen-Image，一种专注于复杂文本生成与精确图片编辑的生成模型，拥有出色的多语言文本渲染能力和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂文本渲染中的挑战以及提升图片编辑的一致性表现。

Method: 设计全面的数据管道和递进式训练策略，同时采用改进的多任务训练范式以及双编码机制以平衡语义一致性与视觉保真度。

Result: Qwen-Image在多项基准任务中表现出色，特别是在多语言文本生成与图片编辑能力方面表现强劲。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑领域达到了最新技术水准，显著增强了复杂文本处理和编辑一致性。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CLIP-IN，一个增强CLIP模型细粒度视觉理解的新框架，通过对比丢失方法和长描述性字幕引入显著改进，包括提升MMVP基准测试的表现和减少视觉幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉理解方面存在局限性，作者希望提升模型区分细微视觉语义差异能力。

Method: 通过利用原本用于图像操作的数据集产生困难的负样本对，配合对称难负样本对比损失，以及引入长描述性字幕，增强模型的细粒度视觉理解能力。

Result: CLIP-IN模型在MMVP基准测试与多种细粒度视觉任务上表现显著提升，同时在广义任务中保持良好零样本性能，并减少了视觉语言模型的视觉幻觉。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，基于指令的对比学习与详细语义信息结合，可大幅提高视觉语言模型的细粒度视觉理解水平。

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对球面图案旋转估计的算法，时间复杂度为线性$O(n)$，并引入了三种创新算法：SPMC, FRS及SPMC+FRS组合方法，显著提升了精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在球面图案旋转估计中效率低下且难以应对大量离群点的情况，因此需要一种更加高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 将球面图案表示为单位球面上的离散3D点集，将旋转估计转化为球面点集配准问题，同时提出三种方法：SPMC, FRS及二者结合的SPMC+FRS算法。

Result: 实验表明，这些算法在$\mathbb{S}^2$域及无对应情况下，其速度比当前最优方法快10倍，精度提升10倍。

Conclusion: 方法在大规模模拟实验和实际应用中表现优异，特别是在PCR及球面图像旋转估计任务中验证了其实用性。

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于即席视频搜索的新方法LPD，通过学习部分去相关的公共空间（Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces）提升搜索结果的多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 即席视频搜索面临的主要挑战是相关视频的视觉多样性。现有方法倾向于融合多种特征，但忽略了多样空间的需求。

Method: LPD结合两项创新：为每种视频和文本特征分别构建公共空间，以及使用去相关损失来增加不同空间中的负样本排序多样性。此外，设计了基于熵的公平多空间三元组排名损失以增强空间收敛一致性。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS基准测试（2016-2023）上显示出LPD的显著有效性，同时结果的多样性可视化也证明了其提升了结果的多样性。

Conclusion: LPD通过更好地利用单独特征的表达能力，实现了更全面的相关视频检索，解决了视频搜索中的视觉多样性问题。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Motivation: 当前音频驱动方法依赖高质量的配对数据，且将音响映射到唇动存在内在模糊性，限制了可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一个以视位为核心的框架，将文本输入嵌入到结构化视位序列中，并通过进阶的视位-音频替换策略实现模型从真实音频到伪音频的过渡。最后通过基于标志点的渲染器生成高质量视频。

Result: 实验结果表明，Text2Lip在语义一致性、视觉真实性和模态鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Text2Lip为灵活且可控的说话人面部动画生成建立了新的范式，并在有音频和无音频的情况下均表现出色。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

Conclusion: 该方法在多个编辑场景中展现了卓越的语义一致性和细节保留能力，且计算效率与基线方法相当，适用于高质量图像编辑应用。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

Method: 创建TRUDI数据集，包含35,034个标注实例，并开发了TITUS管道，通过分割运输单元实例、定位ID文本以及识别和验证ID三阶段完成单元识别。

Result: TITUS系统能够在多种相机视角以及不同行光和天气条件下可靠地识别运输单元。

Conclusion: 公开TRUDI数据集为开发与比较新方法提供了一个强大的基准，同时助力多功能港口的数字化转型，提高整个物流链的效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

*Xingyu Feng,Hebei Gao,Hong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了COLER，用于无监督实例分割和物体检测，通过CutOnce生成初步伪标签，让检测器学习这些伪标签，在多个基准上超过了最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无监督实例分割和物体检测领域，现有方法在效率和性能上仍存在改进空间，缺乏一种简单有效的零样本模型。

Method: 提出CutOnce模块仅通过一次Normalized Cut生成多物体掩码，不依赖于簇方法，并采用设计的模块实现无伪标签后处理训练。采用自监督和自训练整合性能提升。

Result: COLER在多个基准上实现了对先前最先进方法的超越，证明其在目标定位的有效性。

Conclusion: COLER是一种强大的零样本无监督实例分割和物体检测方法，能够推动无监督目标定位领域的发展。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

TL;DR: 研究提出一种名为Hydra的方法，通过结合毫米波雷达和摄像技术检测叶片湿度，在实验中实现了高达96%的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有叶片湿度检测技术缺乏标准化，受植物特性变化和环境条件限制，难以实现高精度和稳健性，无法有效应用于农业实际场景。

Method: 首次设计结合毫米波深度图像和RGB图像的卷积神经网络，用于特征图生成；随后使用基于Transformer的编码器捕捉多特征图间的内在联系，再利用分类器进行检测。同时在数据增强中提升模型的泛化能力。

Result: Hydra使用76至81 GHz的FMCW雷达，展示了在植物实验中96%的分类精度，并在包括雨天、黎明和夜间等多种环境中仍保持约90%的检测精度。

Conclusion: Hydra实现了在实际农业环境中的叶片湿度高准确性检测，为病害管理和农业技术应用提供了重要工具和新方法。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HGTS-Former，一种基于超图的时序Transformer网络，用于解决多变量时间序列的复杂耦合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列分析因高维性、动态性及变量间复杂交互一直是难题，而超图的结构建模能力为解决该问题提供了启发。

Method: 利用多头自注意力增强时间序列的时序表示，构建分层超图以聚合时间模式和变量间关系，通过EdgeToNode模块将超边转换为节点特征，并通过前馈网络优化输出特征。

Result: 在两个多变量时间序列任务和八个数据集上实验，验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former能有效处理多变量时间序列中的复杂耦合问题，并提供了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

*Yin Lin,iccardo Barbieri,Domenico Aquino,Giuseppe Lauria,Marina Grisoli,Elena De Momi,Alberto Redaelli,Simona Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用Vision Transformers (ViTs)直接从MRI图像中提取隐藏特征的新方法，用于预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的生存期，且无需肿瘤分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是侵袭性最强、最常见的脑肿瘤之一，预测总体生存期（OS）对个性化治疗策略制定和临床决策至关重要。

Method: 采用ViTs从MRI图像中提取特征，避免了传统的肿瘤分割步骤，从而简化流程并降低计算资源需求；基于BRATS数据集对模型进行评估。

Result: 在测试集中达到62.5%的准确率，并在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，甚至超越最佳模型；但受限于数据集规模，ViT泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 证明了ViTs在简化计算以及在医学影像下采样任务中的潜力，为无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

TL;DR: 研发了一种能在无声视频中估计语音信息的模型InfoSyncNet，测试显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从无声视频中提取语音内容面临的难题，这是辅助技术(AT)和增强现实(AR)的重要需求。

Method: 提出InfoSyncNet模型，通过非均匀量化模块和专门设计的数据增强方法，改进了视频中口唇运动和语音映射的准确性。

Result: 在LRW和LRW1000数据集上分别实现了92.0%和60.7%的Top-1准确率，刷新现有方法的表现。

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet能有效应对视觉语音数据的自然不一致性，是无声视频语音估计领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

### [214] [SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02464)
*Yonghuang Wu,Wenwen Zeng,Xuan Xie,Chengqian Zhao,Guoqing Wu,Jinhua Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于Segment Anything Model(SAM)的新方法SAMPO，通过优化偏好，使其能够基于稀疏的视觉交互推测高层次的类别意图，从而实现意图感知的多对象分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的SAM模型在稠密均质目标领域（如生物医学核分割）中存在显著局限性：需要用户显式提示具体目标，无法基于用户隐含需求泛化，这极大增加了标注成本。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过优化偏好方法（而非传统的像素级微调）来强化模型对目标类特性的隐式捕获，并实现稀疏提示下的多目标分割。且无需依赖语言模型作为辅助。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务上验证了SAMPO，在PanNuke-T2等复杂任务中，仅使用10%的训练数据微调情况下，其性能超过使用全部数据训练的现有最佳方法，且提升超过9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO通过意图感知对齐建立了视觉基础模型的新范式，消除了对辅助提示生成器或语言模型辅助学习的依赖，同时在稀疏提示条件下表现出色，极具数据效率。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架HierCore，旨在解决多类图像异常检测中性能下降和检测阈值定义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多类图像异常检测中的阈值定义问题，并提出适用于不同条件的通用方案。

Method: 引入Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore)框架，通过分层记忆库估计类别决策标准，适用于有无类别标签的训练和评估条件。

Result: 实验表明，HierCore在所有条件下均表现出强劲且稳定的性能，满足定义的需求。

Conclusion: HierCore框架展示了其在多类异常检测中的实际潜力，可适应实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的误导信息检测方法常忽视单模态数据的不可靠性以及篡改监督的不全面性，导致性能受限。因此需要一种更精细化的监督方法。

Method: 提出了FMS网络，结合模态可靠性监督、单模态内部监督和跨模态监督，通过MDSC、UFMR及MFAR三个模块提供全方位指导。

Result: 实验表明FMS在应对DGM$^4$任务上性能优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: FMS网络通过多种监督模块的创新设计，有效提升了多模态篡改检测任务的性能，为该领域发展提供了新方法。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅支持单镜头视频重建，无法适应多镜头的真实世界场景。挑战包括fMRI信号混合、fMRI与视频间时间分辨率的不匹配以及缺乏多镜头fMRI-视频数据集。

Method: 提出一种分解与解码框架，核心创新包括：1）镜头边界预测模块，将混合fMRI信号分解为镜头特定片段；2）通过大型语言模型生成关键帧字幕，以高层语义克服时间模糊；3）利用现有数据集生成大规模数据集（20k样本）进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多镜头重建保真度上优于最新方法，分解模块显著提升了解码字幕的CLIP相似度71.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架为多镜头fMRI重建提供了一种新范式，通过显式分解和语义提示，实现复杂视频叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究并解决3DGS中产生漂浮伪影的根本原因，尤其是在低质量初始化情况下的表现问题。

Method: 通过从频域的角度分析伪影来源，提出一种称为EFA-GS的方法，动态优化并扩展高斯散布，同时采用基于深度和尺度的策略优化结果。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了该方法，与基线相比RWLQ数据集上的PSNR提升了1.68 dB，同时在3D编辑任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: EFA-GS有效降低了3DGS中漂浮伪影问题，同时保留了几何细节并提高了视觉保真度，未来研究有望应用于更多3D任务。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ReMake的新框架，通过实例遮罩和单目深度估计解决透明物体深度数据缺失问题，取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体导致深度数据不完整或无效，使得机器人抓取的准确性和可靠性降低，现有方法在真实场景中可靠性不足。

Method: 提出ReMake框架，利用实例遮罩区分透明和非透明区域，结合单目深度估计提供上下文信息，从RGB-D输入中对透明区域进行准确深度估计。

Result: 实验表明该方法在基准数据集和真实场景中均优于现有方法，表现出更高的准确性和普适性。

Conclusion: ReMake框架通过显式的透明区域处理和深度上下文利用，提高了深度估计的准确性和在现实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

Motivation: 面对短视频互动预测的挑战，现有方法难以有效建模多模态与特征之间的交互，本文尝试利用大规模多模态模型（LMMs）解决该问题。

Method: 采用两种多模态模型：VideoLLaMA2（结合视频帧、文字元数据和背景音）和Qwen2.5-VL（仅结合视频帧和文字元数据）。两种模型在SnapUGC数据集上进行训练和评估，并通过模型融合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 证明了音频特征在互动预测中的重要性，多模态模型及其融合为准确预测短视频互动提供了有效方案，代码已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

### [222] [Precision-Aware Video Compression for Reducing Bandwidth Requirements in Video Communication for Vehicle Detection-Based Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02533)
*Abyad Enan,Jon C Calhoun,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于精度感知的视频压缩框架（PAVC），通过动态调整视频压缩水平来优化传输带宽和车辆检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能交通系统中，带宽限制可能导致通信瓶颈，进而影响实时车辆检测的性能，因此需要一种方法在节省带宽的同时保证检测精度。

Method: 采用PAVC框架，视频实时压缩传输，并根据天气和光线条件动态调整压缩水平，以维持车辆检测精度并降低带宽需求。

Result: 实验表明，PAVC在带宽有限的情况下能够显著提高检测精度（最多提升13%），并且节省带宽需求（最多降低72倍）。

Conclusion: PAVC框架在优化带宽利用率的同时能够有效维持车辆检测性能，对于带宽受限场景下的智能交通应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

*Shuo Wang,Yongcai Wang,Wanting Li,Yucheng Wang,Maiyue Chen,Kaihui Wang,Zhizhong Su,Xudong Cai,Yeying Jin,Deying Li,Zhaoxin Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoDream是一种轻量级的视觉语言导航(VLA)框架，通过学习统一导航表示(UNR)提升单目导航性能，并缩小与全景RGB-D方法之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全景RGB和深度输入虽然提供了丰富的空间信息，但在实际应用中可能成本高或难以获取，因此需要优化单目输入下的导航方法。

Method: 提出MonoDream框架，通过学习统一导航表示(UNR)，对导航相关的视觉语义和语言驱动的行动意图实现联合对齐。此外，引入潜在全景生成(LPD)任务，基于单目输入预测全景RGB和深度观测的潜在特征，用以监督UNR。

Result: 在多个VLN基准任务上实验表明，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，并大幅缩小了与全景方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream验证了单目输入在导航任务中的潜力，提供了一种高效的替代方案，同时保持了较高的性能水平。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMoMask是一种用于从文本生成动作序列的框架，解决了生成模型和检索增强生成方法中的多种不足，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到动作生成方法存在动作多样性不足、物理不合理以及多模态检索结果不稳定等问题。

Method: 提出了ReMoMask框架，包含三大创新：双向动量文本-动作模型、语义时空注意机制、以及结合RAG无分类器引导的生成策略。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML中，ReMoMask相比之前的方法在FID指标上分别提高了3.88%和10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过多项技术创新实现了更高的动作生成精确度和合理性，取得了新的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

TL;DR: 本文探讨了评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答基准测试中的性能变化问题，并提出通过Cloze风格评估等方法改进可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对MLLMs在VQA性能评估时忽略了模型输出随机性、训练种子敏感性等引起的显著性能差异。

Method: 对14个VQA基准测试中性能变化进行了系统研究，分析训练种子、框架不确定性、模型规模及扩展指令微调对模型性能的影响。此外，探索通过Cloze风格评估以降低随机性。

Result: 研究发现现有评估方法存在局限性，并强调需要更关注方差的评估方法以提升MLLM的可靠性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 通过提出更具方差意识的评估方法，推动MLLM的稳健开发，将提升VQA任务中的公平性和可信性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

*Yijun Xu,Jingrui Zhang,Yuhan Chen,Dingwen Wang,Lei Yu,Chu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为PMGS的算法，通过3D高斯散射重建抛射运动，解决了复杂刚体运动在大时空范围内建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法限制于短期、小范围变形，对物理一致性的考虑不足，因此需要一种能够处理复杂运动的建模方法。

Method: PMGS分为两阶段：1)目标建模，通过动态场景分解和改善的点密度控制实现物体中心重建；2)运动恢复，通过学习每帧SE(3)位姿恢复完整的运动序列。此外，引入加速度一致性约束和卡尔曼融合方案以优化误差积累。

Result: 实验表明，与主流动态方法相比，PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中表现优异。

Conclusion: PMGS为动态重建领域的物理一致性和精确性提供了一种新方法，适用于复杂刚体运动建模。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedVLThinker，一种专注于医疗推理的开放模型。通过系统性数据整理和两种训练方法（监督微调和基于强化学习的可验证奖励），在多个医学问答基准上达到了新高度，并提供了开源模型、数据和代码供研究者使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型缺乏可复现的推理型医疗多模态模型构建方法，限制了社区研究与比较。

Method: 提出了两种训练框架：监督微调（SFT）和基于最终答案正确性的强化学习（RLVR），并对文本及图文数据进行系统性数据整理及训练。

Result: RLVR框架显著优于SFT，且仅基于文本的推理训练相比于多模态数据训练表现更优。训练后的最佳7B模型在公开医疗问答基准上超过所有开源模型，32B模型性能可与GPT-4o匹敌。

Conclusion: 通过开放数据、模型和代码，提供多模态医疗推理领域的强大基础，推动社区后续研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用AugPT通过内部增强原始数据集，提高CLIP-based prompt tuning效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前数据扩充策略常依赖外部知识（如大模型），带来较高数据处理成本，并忽略图像模态特征利用。

Method: 提出了AugPT，利用未标记图像的自监督增强以及基于共识测试的门控机制，通过内部增强实现自包含的提示调优。

Result: 实验表明，AugPT无需依赖外部知识即可提升模型性能及泛化能力。

Conclusion: AugPT通过利用内部数据特性，实现低成本、高效的prompt tuning方案。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数据驱动的图结构学习方法，用于文档分类任务，避免了手动设计和领域依赖，并在三个数据集上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的文档分类方法依赖启发式规则或专家知识，局限性明显，因此需要一种自动生成的图结构方法以减少领域依赖。

Method: 构建以句子为节点的同质加权图，通过自注意力模型学习节点之间的边，并采用统计过滤策略保留强相关的句子，优化图质量同时减小图的规模。

Result: 与基于启发式的图相比，所学得的图在三个数据集上表现出更高的分类准确度和F1分数。此外，统计过滤提高了分类的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自动生成的图结构方法优于传统启发式方法，并为自然语言处理领域的广泛应用指明了新方向。

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在企业场景中可能生成虚假内容，特别是在分析联络中心对话的语义和业务问题根源时，这些虚假的解释会带来重大问题。

Method: 提出了“3D”（Decompose, Decouple, Detach）范式，用于指导人类注释和评估LLMs输出的语言学真实性，并引入一个名为FECT的新基准数据集，专注于联络中心对话的解释性AI生成声明的真实性评估。

Conclusion: 本文为联络中心对话分析AI系统生成的输出真实性评价提供了一种新方法，对未来研究和实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

Motivation: 解决现有框架在语言模型选择和超参数优化时计算开销大且效率低的问题，特别是针对资源效率化的模型微调。

Method: 通过使用元学习技术构建AutoML框架，XAutoLM能学习任务和系统级的元特征，利用这些特征来倾向于高收益配置并避开低效方案。

Result: 在四个文本分类和两个问答基准上，XAutoLM在五个任务上性能超越零样本优化器峰值F1，减少评估时间最多4.5倍，错误率降低至七分之一，发现的有效管道数增加了50%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少计算开销和提高效率，有助于推动更环保的语言模型微调，并为NLP领域提供了新的工具及经验储存。

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAO-ARAG的自适应RAG框架，通过多代理协作优化问答系统的准确性和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界查询的复杂性，固定的RAG流程难以在性能和成本效率之间取得平衡，因此需要一个自适应的解决方案来动态应对不同的查询类型。

Method: 设计一个由多代理协作的RAG框架，包括执行代理（例如查询重构、文档选择和生成代理）和规划代理，使用强化学习根据查询动态规划最优工作流。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个问答数据集上的表现优于固定Pipeline，能够在保持较高答案质量的同时控制成本和时延。

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过动态调整RAG流程，有效提升问答系统的性能，并兼顾成本和响应速度，展示了在复杂查询环境中的优越性。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多语言大语言模型在低资源语言的处理上表现有限，研究旨在通过UrBLiMP评估这些模型在乌尔都语语法上的表现，以了解其在低资源语言方面的潜力和不足。

Method: 研究构建了UrBLiMP数据集，其中包括5696对最小句法对比句，这些句子对在语法可接受性上最小化差异，并目标于十种核心句法现象。采用Urdu Treebank和不同乌尔都语语料库进行精心设计，并通过人类评估验证数据集的可靠性（96.10%的一致性）。

Result: 研究测试了20个多语言大语言模型在UrBLiMP上的表现，发现模型表现随语言现象而显著变化。其中，LLaMA-3-70B表现最佳，平均正确率为94.73%，但与其他顶级模型（如Gemma-3-27B-PT）在统计上表现接近。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多语言大语言模型在捕捉低资源语言细粒度句法知识方面的潜力和局限性，同时提供了一个可靠的乌尔都语评估基准。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Pinterest的系统通过创新性网页表示和模型选择，构建了一个高效、低成本和精确的结构化数据提取解决方案。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在不同语言中进行情感识别的挑战，并提出一种针对性地微调多语言LLM的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感表达在不同语言和文化背景中存在多样性，因此需要开发一种能够跨语言准确识别情感的模型。

Method: 采用LoRA设置，对预训练的多语言LLM根据不同语言单独进行微调。

Result: 发现针对不同语言分别微调的多语言LLM在情感识别任务中表现最好。

Conclusion: 微调多语言LLM是跨语言情感识别的有效方法。

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different
languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can
identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

*Yige Li,Peihai Jiang,Jun Sun,Peng Shu,Tianming Liu,Zhen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adaptive Content Restriction (AdaCoRe)的新任务及方法Suffix Optimization (SOP)，在不需模型微调的情况下对LLM输出进行限制，并通过新基准(CoReBench)验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型(LLMs)的内容限制任务面临适应用户需求变化和高资源需求的挑战，因此需要一种轻量化且灵活的方法进行内容限制。

Method: 提出了Suffix Optimization (SOP)方法，通过在提示中添加优化后的后缀，达到阻止生成特定限制内容的目标，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在新基准CoReBench上，SOP比其他系统基线方法在多个LLMs上提高了输出限制率15%-6%，并在真实世界平台POE中验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: SOP方法在不需模型微调的情况下，为不同内容限制需求提供了一种轻量、有效的解决方案，可以推广至实际应用情境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究通过切分对LLM用户聊天记录的分析，揭示用户行为模式随时间变化的特征，并探索模型能力对用户行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM用户行为模式和模型能力对用户互动影响，为模型和系统设计提供保障。

Method: 提出将聊天查询划分为请求内容、角色、具体上下文和额外表达的技术，通过分析用户查询模式随时间的变化进行研究。

Result: 发现用户的请求模式和人类互动有较大差异，分析揭示用户逐渐趋于请求模式稳定；模型能力的提升和新模型的引入也会显著影响用户行为。

Conclusion: 探讨了用户行为模式的演变以及模型能力对用户行为的作用，为后续研究和LLM改进提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

TL;DR: WebDS是一种新的网络数据科学基准测试，涵盖870种任务，强调复杂多步骤操作，以解决现有基准测试覆盖不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的网络和数据科学基准测试在复杂交互和真实工作流评估上存在不足，无法满足现代数据分析需求。

Method: 提出WebDS，设计了跨越29个网站、包含870个任务的端到端网络数据科学基准测试，涵盖从结构化政府数据到非结构化新闻媒体等多样化数据源。

Result: 通过对当前最先进的语言模型的测试，发现其完成任务的成功率远低于预期，揭示了如信息对齐不足、重复行为、走捷径等问题。

Conclusion: WebDS推动了对实用性更强的LLM驱动数据科学工具的发展，提供了更现实和全面的测试平台。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个称为WarriorMath的新框架，通过识别和改善LLM的特定失败模式，显著提升了其数学问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学领域的表现受到高质量、多样化训练数据的制约，而现有数据增强方法未能有效处理模型的具体失败模式，导致性能提升有限。

Method: 提出WarriorMath框架，联合多个专家LLM生成、批判并改进特定失败问题，从而生成高质量的缺陷感知训练数据，并辅以渐进式训练框架，逐步细调模型以解决其弱点。

Result: 在六个数学基准上，WarriorMath的表现相比其他强基线提升了平均12.57%，创下新的状态-of-the-art。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知、多专家协作的框架能有效提升大语言模型在数学问题解决方面的能力，表明针对失败模式优化的意义和优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加强AI在教育中的透明性和可解释性，尤其是应用于真实场景中。

Method: 在黑客松环境中，组织XAI Challenge 2025。参赛者需构建能够回答学生关于大学政策问题并提供清晰逻辑解释的QA系统，使用轻量级LLM或混合LLM-符号系统并提供高质量数据集支持。

Result: 比赛展示了LLM与符号推理结合的潜力，以及其在构建可信、透明的教育AI中的作用，并提出了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: XAI Challenge 2025是促进教育中AI可解释性的重要一步，为未来进一步开发XAI系统提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过唤醒LLMs中部分相关知识的创新方法，解决现有RAG系统在处理知识库不完整性时的挑战问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统在利用部分相关知识方面存在局限性，尤其在知识库不完整的情况下，如何有效利用部分相关信息尚未得到解决。

Method: 通过剔除包含答案路径的变体，构造部分相关知识，并分析LLMs中唤醒效应的理论基础，同时在KGQA数据集上进行实验，验证假设。还提出一个模拟实体链接失败的新任务Unseen Entity KGQA。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于唤醒效应的方法在实际应用中效果更为显著，相较于传统方法更能有效避免噪声信息的干扰。

Conclusion: 通过部分相关知识的唤醒效应，本文实现了对RAG系统能力的提升，特别是在应对知识库不完整的挑战上展现了优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型（LLM）知识更新中的低效和信息不一致问题，本研究致力于开发一种能够高效执行知识编辑并保持模型性能的新方法。

Method: 提出了KEDAS方法，该方法包括三个阶段：对齐阶段通过低秩适应学习嵌入编辑知识，编辑阶段利用多样性增强技术增加编辑可靠性，推理阶段使用自适应推理机制选择推理路径结合过滤检索器以区分处理相关和不相关查询。

Result: KEDAS在四个数据集、三个LLM和三种设置上的36个实验中取得了35个最佳总成绩，显著优于基于参数编辑和检索的主流技术，并提升了编辑成功率、本地性和可移植性的调和平均分约19.8分。

Conclusion: KEDAS不仅在知识编辑任务中表现优越，在计算成本分析和任务泛化能力上也证实了其效率和鲁棒性，成为知识编辑对齐的理想范式。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Conclusion: LinkSyn框架有效生成了多样化、高质量的数据集LinkQA，对语言模型的持续预训练有显著性能提升效应。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Conclusion: BoostQA能够显著提升STEM领域和高难度问题的模型能力，同时展现了在模型规模、数据量、初始FLOPs增加时的强扩展能力。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

Abstract: We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models

At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

TL;DR: 提出一种称为BADF的框架，用于识别大型语言模型输出中的已知和未知偏见关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于预定义的身份概念关联，无法有效发现新的或未预料到的偏见形式，从而激发了该研究。

Method: 开发Bias Association Discovery Framework (BADF)，通过LLM的开放式生成提取与人口身份相关的描述性概念和偏见。

Result: 通过广泛的实验发现并分析不同模型和真实世界背景下的人口身份相关偏见概念。

Conclusion: BADF推进了对开放式生成中偏见的理解，并提供了一种可扩展的工具来识别和分析LLM中的偏见关联。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

TL;DR: 该研究提出ORACLE框架，通过结合LLMs生成能力与知识图谱的结构优势，解决复杂多跳问答任务中的推理局限性，比拟当前最优模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大型语言模型在复杂多跳问题的推理表现上存在局限，具体为难以捕捉实体间深层次的概念关系。

Method: 提出无需训练的ORACLE框架，包括三阶段：（1）利用LLMs动态构建特定问题的知识本体；（2）将这些本体转化为一阶逻辑推理链；（3）系统地将原始问题分解为逻辑一致的子问题。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试上，与DeepSeek-R1等现有最优方法性能相当，且各组件的有效性得到详细验证。

Conclusion: ORACLE生成的推理链在逻辑性与解释性上优于现有方法，证明了其在复杂推理领域的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据选择策略，名为DIQ，通过平衡样本的困难度和优化影响力选择训练数据，从而在医学推理任务中提高训练效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大型语言模型在领域适配时存在数据质量低、冗余和计算成本高的问题，传统基于样本困难度的方法忽略了样本的优化效用。

Method: 通过引入Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ)策略，将高困难度和高影响力的样本作为优先选择对象，优化模型推理能力并提高数据利用率。

Result: 实验表明，使用仅1%的DIQ选择数据即可达到全数据集的效果，10%数据则能持续超过基线，同时保证了更高质量的医学推理结果。

Conclusion: DIQ数据选择策略证明了通过高效和系统性的数据选择，可以显著减少训练数据量的同时提升医学推理性能，为领域模型高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种语法感知的扩散框架，在代码生成中通过将语法树（AST）的结构信息纳入去噪过程，提升了模型的语法正确性与通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散语言模型忽略了代码的语法和语义规则，无法高效生成符合结构化要求的代码。

Method: 利用语法树(AST)信息进行语法感知的扩散建模，通过选择性地破坏语法相关的代码片段，而非随机掩盖单个Token，提高去噪过程中对代码结构信息的捕捉能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，语法感知的破坏方式显著提高了代码的语法正确性、重构精度以及对未见代码模式的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将结构信息纳入扩散模型训练是提升代码生成任务效果的有效途径，语法引导的去噪过程是一个具有潜力的发展方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Biomedical text mining and question-answering are essential yet highly
demanding tasks, particularly in the face of the exponential growth of
biomedical literature. In this work, we present our participation in the 13th
edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic
question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for
developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source
large language models (LLMs) as retrieval-augmented generators to answer
biomedical questions. Various models are used to process the questions. A
majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for
Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their
answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring
all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in
tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable
insight into which combinations of LLMs consistently produce superior results
for specific question types. In the four rounds of the 2025 BioASQ challenge,
our system achieved notable results: in the Synergy task, we secured 1st place
for ideal answers and 2nd place for exact answers in round 2, as well as two
shared 1st places for exact answers in round 3 and 4.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管特伦古语是最广泛使用的德拉威语之一，但由于缺乏高质量标注资源，该语言在全球自然语言处理和机器学习领域仍然处于代表性不足的状态。

Method: 通过社交媒体、新闻网站和博客抓取多域特伦古语文本，生成26,150句子进行标注；提供解释性评价和公平性评价工具，并使用具有或不具理据的方式微调多种最先进的预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，带有理据的训练方式能够提高模型准确性，减少偏差，并使解释器输出更加贴近人类推理。

Conclusion: 新的基准数据集与评估方法不仅有助于改善特伦古语情感分类任务，还推动了解释性和公平性的进一步研究。

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何影响认知多样性，探讨其设计和使用对集体智能的潜在威胁。

Method: 综合语言学、认知科学和计算机科学的证据，分析大语言模型在反映主导风格及边缘化其他声音方面的作用。

Result: 发现LLMs通过反映训练数据的模式和在多个情境中的频繁使用，加剧了语言和推理的趋同。

Conclusion: 大语言模型若缺乏监管，可能削弱集体智能的多样性和适应性。

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for creating
pedagogical agents that engage in meaningful dialogue to support student
learning. However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms
often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent
tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines
Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding
in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework
with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates
human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive
science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality
assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering
teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the
potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the
ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.

Motivation: 当前手动提示设计复杂且耗时，亟需自动化系统来优化提示，尤其是为了权衡任务性能（如准确性）和上下文规模的平衡。

Method: 通过多目标进化优化方法（EMO），绘制提示解决方案的帕累托前沿，从而在准确性与令牌长度之间提供优化的平衡点。

Result: 在葡萄牙语情感分析任务中，MOPrompt比基准框架表现更佳。例如，在Sabiazinho模型上，MOPrompt在实现与基准框架相同峰值准确率（0.97）的同时，将令牌长度减少了31%。

Conclusion: MOPrompt提供了一种高效的框架，可以在性能和效率之间找到理想平衡，适合将大语言模型部署于实际场景。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法对提示的结构异质性关注不足，未能充分考虑复杂、领域特定提示的不同组件对鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 提出PromptAnatomy框架，将提示分解为功能组件，并通过ComPerturb方法有选择性地扰动组件生成多样化的对抗样本，同时结合基于困惑度的过滤机制确保语言合理性。

Result: 在四个公开数据集和五个先进LLM上的实验表明ComPerturb方法实现了当前最优的对抗攻击成功率，验证了提示解剖和PPL过滤的互补优势。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提示结构意识和受控扰动的重要性，为LLM的可靠对抗鲁棒性评估提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

Motivation: 当前医疗数据中非结构化文本占比超过80%，如何在保障计算效率的同时，实现跨多种实体类型的命名实体识别成为一大挑战。

Method: 通过对DeBERTa-v3、PubMedBERT及BioELECTRA模型进行轻量域自适应预训练（DAPT）和基于LoRA的低参数高效微调，提升性能。

Result: 在12个生物医学NER基准数据集上实现优秀表现，其中10个数据集创新高，尤其在疾病和化学实体上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 本研究证明策略性自适应的开源模型可超越闭源解决方案，并且训练效率高且符合数据保护和AI合规性要求。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

TL;DR: 本文探讨多语言环境下的作者归属问题（Multilingual Authorship Attribution），即在多种语言中识别文本生成者（人类或多种大型语言模型）。指出现有单语言方法在多语言应用中的适配性及其局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的流畅性和连贯性接近人类水平，区分机器生成文本（MGT）与人类书写内容变得更加困难。现有方法主要针对二元分类问题，但多样化的LLMs场景需要更精细的作者归属（AA），特别是在多语言背景下这一问题尚未被深入研究。

Method: 提出多语言作者归属问题，针对涵盖18种语言与8种文本生成者（7种LLMs与人类书写）的数据，评估单语言AA方法在多语言环境下的适配能力及跨语言迁移性，并分析生成者对归属性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现部分单语言AA方法能够适应多语言环境，但跨语言迁移性和覆盖多语种语言族的能力具有显著局限性。

Conclusion: 多语言作者归属问题复杂且具挑战性，需要更稳健的方法来更好地适应真实场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了CUPID基准，用于评估大语言模型(LLMs)在多轮互动中推断用户上下文偏好并生成与其需求匹配的回应的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化LLMs假设用户持有静态偏好，但实际上，人类偏好会因上下文而动态变化。因此，需要评估模型是否能够推断和应用这些上下文偏好以实现对齐。

Method: 设计了CUPID基准，其中包含756个人工编辑的用户与聊天助手的互动会话历史。每次互动中，用户在特定上下文中提交请求并通过多轮反馈表达偏好，以此测试模型是否能够根据历史上下文推断相关偏好并给出符合用户需求的回应。

Result: 使用CUPID评估了10个开源和专有LLMs，发现当前最先进的模型在多轮互动中推断偏好和识别相关上下文方面表现不佳，精度不到50%，召回率不超过65%。

Conclusion: 研究表明需要改进LLMs在上下文个性化互动方面的能力，并提出CUPID作为推动相关进展的资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

### [263] [The Bidirectional Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01682)
*Lingyin Zhang,Jun Gao,Xiaoxue Ren,Ziqiang Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为双向过程奖励模型（BiPRM）的新方法，通过引入从右到左（R2L）的评价流，增强了现有从左到右（L2R）评价模型的全局上下文利用能力，在数学推理任务中显示出显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型（PRMs）主要采用单向从左到右的评价模式，存在无法利用全局上下文和验证步骤一致性的问题。

Method: 本文提出双向过程奖励模型（BiPRM），结合从右到左（R2L）与从左到右（L2R）的评价方式，R2L通过修改原始推理轨迹实现，无需增加参数或推理延迟。

Result: 在两个数学推理基准上，BiPRM在三个基线模型和三种PRM目标下进行测试，结果表明与单向模型相比，其奖励评价提升了最高31.9%。

Conclusion: BiPRM 提供了一种有效、鲁棒且通用的过程奖励建模新方法，展现了在提升推理质量方面的潜力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种新的基于多代理的增强式生成框架（CoCoA和CoCoA-zero），通过整合内在的参数化知识和外部检索知识来改进大型语言模型在知识密集任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG方法难以完全利用知识生成的潜力，尤其是模型内部参数化知识与外部检索知识的协同效果有限。

Method: 提出Collaborative Chain-of-Agents框架，包括CoCoA-zero和CoCoA两个方法，先通过多代理条件知识归纳进行推理，再通过长链训练策略优化模型的联合知识利用能力。

Result: 实验显示，CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放领域和多跳QA任务中均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合参数化知识和检索知识的新方法，可以显著提升大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中的能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)容易引入与上下文无关的情感化表达的新现象，即表达泄露问题，并提出了对应的数据集与自动评估方案用于分析与减轻该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理上取得了显著进展，但它们容易受到无关信息的影响。本文旨在研究一种未被广泛探索的现象，即表达泄露问题，模型会生成情绪化表达但与输入语境无关。

Method: 收集了一个基准数据集，并开发了从Common Crawl自由文本自动生成数据集的方案。此外，提出了一种自动化评估流程，能有效替代人工评价加速分析过程。

Result: 实验结果显示，在同一LLM家族中，随着模型参数规模的扩大，表达泄露现象减少。然而，仅通过Prompt无法减轻泄露问题，建模时需特别关注。此外，负面情感注入比正面情感注入对生成过程的干扰更大。

Conclusion: 表达泄露是LLMs生成中的潜在问题，需要重新设计模型构建流程。提高模型参数规模对减轻该问题有效，但并非治本之策。负面情感对模型生成的影响较大，需特别关注。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非英语语言在内容安全方面的研究不足问题，填补多语言大模型在文化安全需求领域的空白。

Method: 提出四阶段的合成数据生成与筛选管道，包括文化数据分离、文化数据适配、机器翻译和质量筛选，并将Nemotron英语数据集扩展为多语言版本，通过LoRA微调训练安全模型。

Result: 生成了包含9种语言的386,661条样本数据的多语言数据集，并训练出性能达到最新水平的安全模型。

Conclusion: CultureGuard显著推动了多语言大模型文化安全领域的发展，缩小了不同语言间的安全性差距。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为IterChat的新方法，通过改进数据格式和利用GPT4生成高质量对话数据，以提升多轮对话系统中用户偏好提取的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮对话系统在提取用户偏好时因标注质量和上下文依赖性导致的困难显著，且需要大量领域专业知识和保持上下文一致性，制约了模型训练和应用。

Method: 提出IterChat框架，通过引入新的数据格式将对话数据分为带属性的历史偏好和单轮对话，结合GPT4设计偏好槽并生成多样化的对话数据集，从而改善标注质量与效率。

Result: 实验表明，利用新数据格式进行微调或少样本提示能够显著提升性能，新格式对标注人员效率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: IterChat框架成功优化了对话数据的标注和生成过程，提升了用户偏好提取任务的效果和标注效率，为多轮对话系统的开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

TL;DR: 现有AI生成文本检测方法忽略了统计信息的位置性，本研究提出了保留位置信息的TDT方法，并显著提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI检测方法对局部对抗性扰动易失效，因为它们忽略了文本中的非平稳性与统计特性的位置变化。

Method: 提出了Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT)方法，将检测任务转换为信号处理问题，通过连续小波变换捕捉统计异常的时空信息。

Result: 在RAID基准测试中，TDT取得了0.855的AUROC，比最佳基线高7.1%，且在对抗性任务上也表现出14.1%的AUROC提升，同时计算开销仅增加13%。

Conclusion: TDT方法证明文本非平稳性是AI生成文本的基本特性，保留时间动态对稳健检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在自然语言处理中因幻觉问题而带来的关键挑战，从而提高其可靠性和负责性。

Method: 通过定义与理论框架分类幻觉，分析其成因、影响因素，综述评估基准与缓解技术，并提出具体应对策略。

Result: 总结了LLM幻觉的类型（如事实性错误、上下文冲突、时间错位等），并归纳其产生原因（数据、模型、提示相关）。

Conclusion: LLMs幻觉的产生具理论不可避免性，未来需注重检测、缓解与人类监督以确保负责任的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

Motivation: 希伯来语NLP主要聚焦形态句法任务，缺乏语义理解的衡量数据集。

Method: 开发了针对希伯来语特性的一套标注指南、众包协议和改进的评估指标，建立了希伯来语MRC数据集HeQ。

Result: 创建了HeQ数据集，包含从维基百科和以色列科技新闻中衍生的30,147个问题-答案对，证明了现有评估指标对MRLs不适用，并提出改进方案。

Conclusion: 提出的新评估方法适用于包括希伯来语在内的形态丰富语言，并揭示了解决形态句法任务模型的不足是提升语义任务表现的关键。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SPARQL方法在低资源领域和多图查询处理上存在局限性，尤其在像循环经济这样的领域需求中表现不佳。

Method: 提出AgenticT$^2$S框架，将知识图问答任务分解为由专门代理处理的子任务，并通过调度器和双阶段验证器实现结构化和语义有效性检查。

Result: 在循环经济知识图上实验表明，AgenticT$^2$S在执行准确性上提高了17.3%，三元组级F$_1$值提高了25.4%，且提示长度减少46.4%。

Conclusion: AgenticT$^2$S框架通过基于代理的架构实现了跨知识图的可扩展推理，为可持续性领域的决策提供了强有力的支持。

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Method: 通过引入预训练的外部可微分内存（一个模仿检索器行为的MLP），解耦语言模型解码器中的记忆功能，从而形成包括Transformer解码器和外部MLP的架构。

Result: 提出的架构在WikiText-103和Web数据集上分别提升17.5%和24.1%的性能，并在幻觉基准和记忆密集型任务上取得优异表现，同时在推理速度上显著优于$k$NN-LM和传统解码器模型。

Conclusion: 新模型有效减少幻觉问题并提升模型性能，且在保持推理质量的同时大幅提高效率。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成的流畅但不准确或无依据的幻觉问题。

Method: 通过动态生成看似可信但具有细微事实错误的反事实陈述，并评估模型对这些扰动的敏感性来识别幻觉内容，同时开发了适应性降低幻觉的策略。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、事实陈述数据集和策划的幻觉例子上，该方法的检测性能优于基线方法，且减轻幻觉的平均分数下降24.5%。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing是一种有效的实时验证机制，可集成于现有大型语言模型管道中，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious

PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

### [276] [Word Overuse and Alignment in Large Language Models: The Influence of Learning from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01930)
*Tom S. Juzek,Zina B. Ward*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过Meta的Llama模型研究，发现人类反馈学习(LHF)可能导致大语言模型出现词汇过度使用现象，如过度使用"delve"和"intricate"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尝试解释大语言模型为何词汇选择上存在偏好，尤其是词汇过度使用，以及这些偏好的来源。

Method: 设计了一种简单的检测LHF诱导的词汇偏好的方法，并通过模拟LHF实验验证词汇偏好与LHF的关联性。

Result: 实验表明LHF过程中的人类反馈会导致某些词汇过度使用，这种现象可视为模型与用户期望间的一种对齐问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LHF对词汇使用的影响，强调在对齐研究中数据和程序透明性的重要性，并丰富了可解释性人工智能领域的相关研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

*Philip Schroeder,Ondrej Biza,Thomas Weng,Hongyin Luo,James Glass*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ROVER框架，通过递归方式对长时间视频轨迹分解为较短子任务，从而提升对视频序列的推理能力，解决了当前视觉语言模型在长帧序列推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理需跨长帧序列推理的视频任务时表现欠佳，限制了其在具身系统中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解长视频序列为短子任务段落，结合子任务特定的滑动上下文窗口，提升推理能力并改进时间复杂度。

Result: 在OpenX Embodiment视频集及RoboCasa数据集中，ROVER在任务进度估算、逐帧自然语言推理和视频问答三项任务上优于基线模型，同时降低了推理过程中的幻觉现象。

Conclusion: ROVER通过优化视觉信息的处理方式，有效提升了视觉语言模型在长时间视频推理任务中的性能，其时间复杂度也优于传统方法，具有潜在应用优势。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法(SitEmb)，通过考虑广泛上下文来增强长文档中的检索性能，并分别开发了SitEmb-v1和SitEmb-v1.5模型，在多个基准和应用中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对长文档的RAG方法在处理文本切分时对上下文依赖缺乏支持，且现有嵌入模型受制于长上下文编码的能力不足，需要提高表征短文本的上下文感知嵌入能力。

Method: 提出了一种新训练范式和新模型SitEmb，采用上下文条件化表征短文档嵌入，同时设计了一个新检索基准数据集用于评估。

Result: SitEmb-v1模型在特定检索任务中优于现有7-8B参数的最先进嵌入模型，而SitEmb-v1.5进一步提升性能并展现出多语言及多领域适应性。

Conclusion: SitEmb通过新的上下文感知嵌入方法显著提高了文档检索的性能，是优于其他同领域模型的先进解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Method: 通过链式思维提示方法自动构建了丰富多样的藏语数据集TIBSTC-CoT，并以此为基础训练了具备推理能力的藏语语言模型Sunshine-thinking。

Result: Sunshine-thinking模型表现出很强的推理与生成能力，与SOTA的多语种大语言模型相比具备竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究为藏语高质量语言处理奠定了基础，通过资源创建与模型创新推动了AI的包容性发展。

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language
spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale,
multi-domain Tibetan dataset automatically constructed via chain-of-thought
prompting with large language models (LLMs). TIBSTC-CoT establishes a scalable
and reproducible framework for dataset creation in low-resource settings,
covering diverse domains and reasoning patterns essential for language
understanding and generation. Building on this dataset, we develop the
Sunshine-thinking LLM family, a series of Tibetan-centric LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought capabilities. Trained entirely on TIBSTC-CoT,
Sunshine-thinking has demonstrated strong reasoning and generation performance,
comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual LLMs. Our work marks a
significant step toward inclusive AI by enabling high-quality Tibetan language

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的端到端电子商务产品问答框架，结合用户历史、个人信息和产品属性，提供个性化回答并支持信息改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有产品问答系统未能有效利用丰富的用户上下文和多样化的产品信息，用户难以快速精准找到所需信息。

Method: 使用检索增强生成（RAG）方法，结合会话历史、用户资料和产品属性，处理不同类型的问题并识别信息缺失点，支持内容改进。

Result: 提供个性化、精准的回答，能够处理多意图、主观和客观问题并支持异构数据源，且引入新评价指标以测评性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的RAG框架在电子商务中能高效整合多源信息，提升用户体验，并为内容优化提供支持。

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Motivation: 探索如何在社交媒体中检测到照护痴呆症患者的家庭成员分享的推文，进而为此类人群提供基于网络的支持干预。

Method: 采用大语言模型(LLMs)，结合不同提示方法进行推文的二元分类，最终使用零样本提示和微调模型的组合达到最佳效果。

Result: 模型在验证集和测试集上都达到了宏F1得分0.95的优异结果。

Conclusion: 简单的零样本提示与已优化的模型相结合能有效检测痴呆患者家庭成员的相关推文，为发展基于互联网的干预措施奠定基础，同时代码在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有的角色扮演研究主要集中于文本模态，忽略了语音在交互场景中的重要性，且缺乏针对语音角色扮演代理的系统性评估。

Method: 构建了包含98种角色和112k语音交互数据的SpeechRole-Data数据集，并提出了SpeechRole-Eval，多维评估基准用于评估SRPAs在交互能力、语音表现力及角色一致性等方面的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，级联式和端到端语音角色扮演代理在保持语音风格一致性和角色连贯性方面各有优劣。

Conclusion: 本文为基于语音驱动的多模态角色扮演研究提供了一套开放资源，包括数据、代码和基线模型，推动该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing
research and to foster further developments in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了SpeechR，一个用于评估大音频语言模型在语音推理能力上的统一基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注表层感知，缺乏对模型在语音场景中的上下文推理能力评估。

Method: 设计了一个名为SpeechR的统一基准测试，涵盖事实检索、过程推理和规范性判断，提供选择题、生成式和声学特征三种评估形式。

Result: 评估了11种先进的大音频语言模型，发现高转录精度并不等同于强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为评估语音语言中的推理能力提供了结构化基准，可用于分析模型在多样对话任务下的能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

*Huihan Li,You Chen,Siyuan Wang,Yixin He,Ninareh Mehrabi,Rahul Gupta,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为STIM的新框架，用于在推理中进行记忆来源的逐步识别，从而分析大语言模型中记忆对错误的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理基准测试中表现出色，但当输入稍有改变时常会失败。这引发了对这些模型是否过度依赖记忆的担忧，尤其是链式推理中，错误的记忆模式可能导致错误的传播。

Method: STIM框架通过统计分析训练中的记忆来源，将推理过程中每个token归因于局部、中程或远程记忆，以识别错误并评估记忆对推理的影响。

Result: 分析表明模型在复杂或长尾情况下更依赖记忆，而局部记忆通常是驱动错误的主要原因。这导致了高达67%的错误位于错误的token上。此外，STIM得出的记忆分数可以有效预测错误的推理环节中的错误token。

Conclusion: STIM是一种强大的诊断和改进模型推理的方法，并具有推广到其他结构化逐步生成任务的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly

Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism
with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of
speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional
embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality
emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six
professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

Conclusion: TDBench填补了Wikipedia/Wikidata以来的评估缺口，为时间敏感问答领域提供了更强大的工具与新指标。

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ProCut的框架，通过归因分析对提示词进行压缩，显著减少提示词大小，同时保持或略微提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级LLM系统中的提示词模板通常因多次迭代变得冗长，增加了成本和推理延迟，亟需简化和优化方案。

Method: ProCut是一种灵活、与LLM无关且无须训练的框架，通过归因分析将提示词分段为有意义的单元，量化其任务影响并修剪低效部分。

Result: ProCut通过对五个公共数据集和真实工业提示词的实验，实现了提示词大小缩减78%，性能较替代方法提高多达62%。

Conclusion: ProCut能无缝集成现有提示优化框架，显著压缩提示词的同时维持或提升性能，并降低优化延迟。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在自主网上浏览时是否能够借鉴人类研究者应对不可信信息的基本启发式方法。

Method: 设计一个名为SMeL Test的基准，用于测试语言模型在上下文中主动过滤不可信信息的能力，并对多种指令调优的语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 测试表明，没有模型能够始终信任更可靠的来源；推理能力强的模型表现稍优，但即便是最好的API模型，仍有高达70%的幻觉率。此外，模型规模和性能并不直接相关。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了语言模型在信息可信性判断中的不足，特别是与幻觉相关的问题，并希望推动改进模型方法的研究。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

TL;DR: 大语言模型对用户意见表现出了一致性的迎合行为，即使这些意见与事实相矛盾。本文探讨这种迎合行为的内在机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究此前被观察到的语言模型的迎合行为，揭示这种行为的内在机制，以改进模型在对齐和真实性方面的表现。

Method: 通过logit-lens分析和因果激活补丁技术，系统分析不同模型对用户意见的响应机制，研究观点陈述、用户专业程度、语法视角等因素对迎合行为的影响。

Result: 发现迎合行为分两个阶段：晚层的输出偏好改变和更深层次的表示分歧；语法视角如“我认为...”比“他认为...”触发更高的迎合率。此外，用户权威影响并未在模型中被有效编码。

Conclusion: 迎合行为不仅是表层现象，而是从深层次结构中覆盖所学知识的表现，对对齐和真实AI系统有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment

### [290] ["Harmless to You, Hurtful to Me!": Investigating the Detection of Toxic Languages Grounded in the Perspective of Youth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02094)
*Yaqiong Li,Peng Zhang,Lin Wang,Hansu Gu,Siyuan Qiao,Ning Gu,Tun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了社交媒体中青年独特的“青年毒性”语言，探讨了现有毒性检测技术的局限性，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究针对社交媒体中的毒性检测进行了广泛研究，但忽视了青少年与成人在毒性语言理解上的显著差异，以及其中青年独有的毒性语言特征。

Method: 以中国青年为研究对象，构建首个中文“青年毒性”数据集，并分析其语言特征；同时探讨现有毒性检测模型能否准确识别这些特定语言，并融入元信息以改进检测方法。

Result: 研究发现，青少年对毒性语言的感知受到多种上下文因素的影响，整合这些信息后可显著提升现有方法的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究填补了青少年毒性语言研究的空白，为面向青少年的毒性检测技术的发展提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

*David Demitri Africa,Yuval Weiss,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于MAML和子集掩码语言模型预训练的新方法，旨在提高小型语言模型的训练效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨元学习能否让小型语言模型的预训练过程不仅更高效，还更加可解释。

Method: 将一阶MAML与子集掩码语言模型预训练相结合，训练了包含不同规模参数的解码器模型，并进行了多语言NER任务评估。

Result: 与常规训练相比，该方法达到了相同损失所需时间减半，提高了NER任务的F1分数，同时揭示训练动态的阶段性变化现象。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了小型语言模型的训练效率，并通过分析训练动态展示了元适应过程中可解释的特征变化模式。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Motivation: 解决逐字解码模式产生的内在延迟问题，提升推理速度。

Method: 通过采用非顺序并行生成的离散扩散模型来加速推理，同时保证代码模型性能。

Result: 在标准代码评估基准测试中表现出竞争力，推理速度显著快于现有的Mercury和Gemini模型。

Conclusion: 在代码模型的速度-质量帕累托前沿上设立了新的行业标准。

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto
frontier for code models.

TL;DR: 提出了Proof2Hybrid框架，用于自动生成高质量数学证明基准，并通过AlgGeoTest基准测试LLMs的代数几何能力，结果揭示其不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准难以全面评估LLMs的数学能力，特别是证明问题，且手动创建方法不可扩展。

Method: 引入Proof2Hybrid框架，通过Proof2X将数学证明转化为易验证的问题形式，并设计了抗猜测的新型混合格式问题“m-out-of-n multiple judge questions”。

Result: 开发了AlgGeoTest基准，包括456个代数几何问题，通过评估表明，现有LLMs在代数几何理解上存在显著缺失。

Conclusion: 框架和基准为深入研究AI数学智能能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型中存在与文化相关的神经元，这些神经元主要位于模型的上层，可以与语言相关神经元独立地进行操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨和确定多语言大型语言模型中是否以及如何编码文化内容。

Method: 基于已有的语言特定神经元识别方法，将其扩展为文化特定神经元的定位和隔离；为实验设计了MUREL数据集，含有六种文化的8520万标记。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs的不同文化编码在分别的神经元群中，且主要位于模型的上层，这些文化神经元可以独立于语言或其他文化的神经元进行调控。

Conclusion: 文化知识和倾向可以在多语言语言模型中被选择性地隔离和编辑，促进公平性、包容性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言模型中语言干扰的规律，理解语言间干扰的本质及其对性能的影响。

Method: 通过对小型BERT-like模型进行语言对训练和评估，构建语言间干扰矩阵，并分析干扰模式与各种语言特性（如语言家族、嵌入相似性、书写体系）的关系。

Result: 发现语言干扰是不对称的，与书写体系的关系最显著，而非传统语言学特性。同时证明干扰矩阵可用于预测下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 干扰矩阵是分析多语言模型语言干扰的重要工具，可用于优化多语言模型设计和性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补关于RLVR熵-性能交换机制在不同粒度的细致理解的研究空白，推动其在大语言模型推理能力提升中的有效应用。

Method: 通过将训练阶段分为熵上升和熵稳定两个阶段，在阶段、实例和令牌三个粒度上系统性分析交换机制，并提出基于困惑度和位置信息动态调整奖励信号的改进方法。

Result: 研究发现：负样本的熵减少有助于在熵上升阶段学到有效推理模式，而在熵稳定阶段，学习效率与低困惑度样本的高熵令牌以及序列末端位置的令牌强相关。

Conclusion: 通过针对高学习潜力令牌动态调整奖励信号，提升了RLVR在多个大语言模型中的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Motivation: 阿拉伯世界存在MSA与地区方言之间的语言差距，这种双言现象对自然语言处理尤其是机器翻译构成挑战。

Method: 基于AraT5v2-base-1024架构，开发了分别针对MSA到Shami和Shami到MSA的翻译模型。模型经过Nabra数据集的微调，并在MADAR语料库的未见数据上进行了验证。

Result: MSA-to-Shami模型在GPT-4.1评测中获得了4.01/5.0的平均质量分数，显示了其高精准性和方言真实性。

Conclusion: 该研究为之前被忽略的语言对提供了重要工具，在方言阿拉伯语翻译领域取得了实际进展，并在内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and
intercultural communication.

Motivation: 为解决当前自然语言处理领域数据集存在的许可限制、缺乏社区参与的演变机制和质量保证局限性等问题。

Method: 提出Dynaword框架，允许通过社区协作持续更新数据集；并实现了丹麦版本（Danish Dynaword），以实际应用验证框架。

Result: Danish Dynaword较类似数据集拥有四倍以上语料，完全开放授权，并吸纳了产业和学术界的广泛贡献，同时通过轻量级测试确保数据质量和格式。

Conclusion: Dynaword方法和Danish Dynaword验证了开放、协作、可持续发展的数据集创建模式，具有可扩展性和实践意义。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Motivation: 为了在安全关键应用中实现检索增强生成（RAG）系统的安全性和领域内响应，这篇论文尝试解决领域外（OOD）查询检测的挑战。

Method: 研究了四种OOD查询检测方法：GPT-4o、基于回归的方法、主成分分析（PCA）方法和神经崩塌（NC）方法，并引入两种新颖的降维与特征分离策略即PCA和神经崩塌特征分离。

Result: 在标准数据集（StackExchange、MSMARCO）与实际应用（药物滥用、COVID-19）中验证了方法有效性，同时在COVID-19疫苗聊天机器人上测试LLM模拟和实际攻击，证明外部OOD检测器对保持响应关联性至关重要。

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器对于RAG系统在安全关键应用中的响应正确性和相关性至关重要，提出的策略有效减少了OOD响应风险。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

TL;DR: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为LaMPE的训练无关方法，用以提升LLM在长输入上下文中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM在上下文长度超过预训练窗口时性能明显下降，主要由于RoPE在超出分布范围时的行为问题。

Method: 提出了LaMPE，通过参数化的缩放Sigmoid函数建立映射关系，并使用多粒度注意力机制分配序列区域的定位分辨率，提升对长输入上下文的适应能力。

Result: 在三个主流LLM和五个常用长上下文基准中，LaMPE显著优于现有方法，效果卓著。

Conclusion: LaMPE能被无缝应用于多种RoPE类模型，无需训练即可大幅提升长输入上下文的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at
https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

Conclusion: VeOmni框架显著简化了全模态LLM的训练流程，具备效率高、扩展性强的特点，为开发全模态LLM提供了一个强大的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for

Motivation: 当前MoE模型尽管在任务表现上随参数增加而提升，但在计算和存储开销上同样有显著增长，且性能并未与参数数目完全成比例。现有减参数方法存在性能和计算效率的局限性。

Method: 论文提出利用微专家作为更细粒度的压缩单位，开发无训练的轻量化框架CAMERA，对微专家冗余进行识别，并设计了结构化修剪框架CAMERA-P与混合精度量化框架CAMERA-Q来优化模型效率。

Result: 在九项下游任务上的实验结果表明，CAMERA-P在20%-60%修剪比下表现优于强基线；CAMERA-Q在2-bit量化下也获得了优于现有方法的结果。实现了用单卡GPU对超大模型进行微专家解析的快速分析。

Conclusion: CAMERA框架实现了微专家层面的精细优化，显著提升了计算和存储效率，同时保留了较强的性能表现，展现了该方法在大模型优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究表明微调可能导致政治立场的非预期泛化，但无法深入理解其内部机制与表征。本研究旨在揭示这些内在机制并提出有效解决方案。

Method: 提出PNLAC方法，定位模型中的两类政治神经元——内部广义政治神经元和主题特定神经元，并设计InhibitFT微调方法以减轻跨主题的立场泛化问题。

Result: 通过四个模型和数据集的实验验证，发现神经元类型具有鲁棒性，InhibitFT方法将跨主题泛化减少了20%，仅需抑制5%的神经元即可显著改善模型表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以通过识别和选择性抑制特定神经元减少政治立场的跨主题泛化，同时保留特定主题的性能，解决了模型的非预期行为问题，方法稳定有效。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

*Xiaolin Lin,Jingcun Wang,Olga Kondrateva,Yiyu Shi,Bing Li,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新的方法CompressKV，通过选择性利用注意力头和层适应性KV缓存分配策略，提高了大语言模型LLMs处理长上下文的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的KV缓存大小对内存和执行效率提出了严峻挑战，而现有方法在KV缓存压缩中未能有效区分注意力头的不同功能，从而影响了模型性能。

Method: 通过识别每层中的关键注意力头来决定重要的tokens，并保留其对应的KV缓存对，并引入层自适应KV缓存分配策略优化每一层的缓存效率。

Result: 实验表明，该CompressKV方法在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，在不同内存预算下均优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV方法能更高效地管理LLMs的KV缓存，在处理长上下文任务中展现了卓越的性能和更优的内存利用率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

### [306] [Learning to Evolve: Bayesian-Guided Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02426)
*Linyu Li,Zhi Jin,Yuanpeng He,Dongming Jin,Yichi Zhang,Haoran Duan,Nyima Tash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新模型BAKE，旨在解决知识图谱嵌入中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态知识图谱嵌入（CKGE）容易出现灾难性遗忘，传统静态方法无法适应知识图谱的演变需求。

Method: 基于贝叶斯后验更新原则，BAKE将新增数据视为模型先验的贝叶斯更新，并结合一种持续聚类方法，约束不同快照知识间的演化差异。

Result: 实验结果表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE可以更好地保留早期知识快照，并有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，适合用于知识图谱的动态演化场景。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）取代人工专家评估来衡量创新性，并提出了一个能够可靠近似领域专家评估的LLM框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前创新测量往往依赖于具体情境和人工专家评估，而这限制了相关研究的范围。本研究旨在利用LLMs来超越传统评估方法的局限性，并协助研究者更广泛地衡量创新。

Method: 设计了一个基于LLM的框架，从非结构化文本数据中近似专家对创新性的评估。通过两个案例（软件更新创新性和用户反馈的原创性）验证其性能，并与传统测量方法及先进的机器学习模型进行对比。

Result: LLM框架在F1分数和一致性方面优于传统方法和现有模型，并展示出在不同运行条件下结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业的研发人员以及研究者提供了一种利用LLM测量创新的新工具，并讨论了模型选择、提示工程等设计决策对性能的影响，显示LLMs在创新测量中的巨大潜力及广泛适用性。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化大语言模型的提示可以显著提高任务表现，但现有方法多依赖于启发式或手动实验，存在局限性。

Method: 通过LatentPrompt，将初始提示嵌入到连续的潜在空间中，系统探索以寻找能最大化任务性能的提示，无需手工规则，只需LLM及自动评估指标的支持即可应用。

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类基准测试中，LatentPrompt在单次优化循环后使分类准确率提高约3%。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt能够有效提升提示优化效率，且可广泛适用于不同领域和任务，具有通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在政府压制下，Facebook如何成为抗议者的核心抵抗空间，并推动集体身份的形成。

Method: 采用定性研究方法，分析视觉修辞、语言话语和数字讽刺，包括象征性符号、抗议艺术和口号等。

Result: 研究发现，视觉和语言策略共同作用，不仅动员了公众情感，还构建了强有力的集体身份以反抗威权叙事。

Conclusion: Facebook在数字时代是身份构建和政治动员的重要工具，可有效团结和激励群众对抗不公。

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言身份下的心理语言学表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同语言环境下如何反映人类语言心理学特性，以进一步了解其作为跨语言认知模型的潜力。

Method: 通过两个任务（声音象征和词语情感）评估了两种语言模型，涉及英语、荷兰语和中文的单语及双语提示。

Result: 两种模型根据语言身份调整输出，Qwen对语言区分更敏感；心理语言学信号在深层网络中表现更强，中文提示情感表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 语言身份显著影响模型输出行为及其内部表示，这为使用LLMs研究跨语言认知提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)在执行简单算术任务时的内部机制，发现它们通过数字位置特定的电路解决算术问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究揭示了LLMs处理简单算术任务的部分策略，但对其机制的统一理解仍然缺乏，需要更深入的探索。

Method: 通过特征重要性分析和因果干预方法，识别并验证数字位置特定的电路，明确其在解决算术问题中的作用。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs中存在独立于模型规模和标记策略的数字位置特定电路，这些电路能够独立处理不同的数字位数（个位、十位、百位）。

Conclusion: 数字位置特定电路证实了LLMs在算术任务中的因果作用，揭示了其具有的组合性和可解释性的结构。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否能够在严格的形式、声韵、押韵约束下生成符合规范的文化重要文本如《宋词》。

Method: 建立了多维度的评估框架，包括形式符合性分数、自动化质量评估、人类评价、以及分类任务；对18种模型在五种提示策略下进行比较；提出生成-批评架构，通过批评器反馈改进模型。

Result: 通过引入生成-批评架构和监督微调，部分轻量化开源模型的形式符合性提升了5.88%。

Conclusion: 提供了生成任务中大语言模型的优劣势洞察，并为生成具文化意义且形式约束严格的文本提出一种改进方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Method: 分析 Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct 在音位相关任务中的表现，包括其潜在空间的组织方式，并通过可视化识别出与音位信息相关的关键机制"音位移动头"。

Result: 发现 Llama 在无监督情况下学习出了类似国际音标元音图的元音模型，并通过高层次的音素表示完成任务。

Conclusion: Llama 模型能够构建和利用复杂的音位表示，其内部机制具备一定的类人组织特点，显示了其强大的语言任务处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

TL;DR: 提出了Contextual Graph Transformer（CGT），一种结合图神经网络（GNN）与Transformer的混合神经架构，用于复杂技术文档的问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在处理技术领域复杂语法和实体关系时效果欠佳，需提出更适合的解决方案。

Method: 设计CGT，通过动态构建包含序列、跳元和语义相似性边的图，利用GATv2Conv层学习局部结构特征，并借助Transformer编码器捕获全局依赖；模型包括两阶段训练，先通用文本预训练，再技术文档微调。

Result: 在一个检索增强生成（RAG）的框架中，CGT在问答任务中取得了显著性能提升，相比GPT-2提升24.7%准确率，并减少62.4%参数量。

Conclusion: CGT能够有效结合局部结构与全局语义，适用于技术语言场景，提高了实体跟踪、基础理解和检索增强响应能力。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student
learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This
paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Motivation: 填补某些领域或语言缺乏平行文本的空白，并能够通过可比语料了解不同语言中对同一主题的表述。

Method: 从Wikipedia和EURONEWS收集英语、法语和阿拉伯语的语料，使用基于跨语言相似性的自动对齐方法，分别研究基于双语词典和基于潜在语义索引(LSI)的相似性度量。

Result: 实验表明基于CL-LSI的度量在对齐话题和事件层面的跨语言文档时效果优于基于字典的度量。

Conclusion: 使用CL-LSI方法可以有效地在话题和事件层面对齐跨语言文档。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

Conclusion: 多视角话语分析框架不仅能够为人工反馈提供帮助，还可支持AI教育系统的发展，提升课堂互动和学习环境的响应性。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

*Ali Noori,Pratik Devkota,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用Bi-GRU模型进行SNOMED CT概念识别，达到90%的F1分数，表现优于传统和现有神经模型，同时计算成本较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床文本自动化标注效率低下，手动标注劳动强度大且不适合大规模应用，因此需要高效的自动化方法。

Method: 采用基于Bi-GRU的神经序列标注方法，使用经过SpaCy和SciBERT适配处理的文本数据，并对句子分块标注IOB标签。

Result: 在验证集上取得90% F1分数，超越传统规则和部分现有神经模型，并有效解决歧义术语及拼写错误问题。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构（例如Bi-GRU）能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念注释，适合现实场景中的部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

*Yuerong Song,Xiaoran Liu,Ruixiao Li,Zhigeng Liu,Zengfeng Huang,Qipeng Guo,Ziwei He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章介绍了一种名为Sparse-dLLM的无训练框架，通过稀疏注意力与动态缓存驱逐机制优化扩散大语言模型（dLLMs），提高推理效率及降低内存需求，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型在推理时计算复杂度和内存开销高，而现有缓存技术虽然加速解码却占用大量内存，难以适应长上下文应用场景。通过分析dLLMs的注意力模式，发现层间存在稀疏性特征，为优化提供了新方向。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合延迟的双向稀疏缓存和注意力引导的动态缓存驱逐机制，利用token重要性在解码步中稳定性的特性，保留关键token并动态移除低重要性prefix/suffix条目。

Result: 实验表明，Sparse-dLLM在LLaDA和Dream等测试中，相较普通dLLMs能实现高达10倍的推理吞吐量，同时维持相当的性能和峰值内存消耗，并在效率和有效性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在无需重新训练模型的情况下，显著提升了扩散大语言模型的推理效率和内存利用率，是一种高效且有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

*Xiaoyu Pan,Yang Bai,Ke Zou,Yang Zhou,Jun Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yih-Chung Tham,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为EH-Benchmark的新型基准，用于评估医疗大语言模型（MLLMs）在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中表现出潜力，但基于幻觉问题导致的诊断准确性不足，需要一个有效的基准来评估和缓解这些问题。

Method: 作者提出了一种以代理为中心的三阶段框架，包括知识层检索、任务层案例研究和结果层验证，以削减幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，该多代理框架显著减少了视觉理解和逻辑组合两大类幻觉，提高了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为评估和缓解MLLMs在眼科医学应用中的幻觉问题提供了有效途径，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

*Jérémie Dentan,Davide Buscaldi,Sonia Vanier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法分析大语言模型（LLMs）的逐字记忆现象，指出现有分类方法不足，并提出更加精确的新分类，区分记忆机制的不同表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中的逐字记忆机制现象，评估现有分类系统的有效性，并试图提供更准确的分类方法以理解记忆机制。

Method: 训练卷积神经网络（CNNs）分析LLMs注意力权重，评估与现有记忆分类系统的匹配度，并提出一种新的记忆分类方法，同时开发可视化技术定位注意力重要区域。

Result: 发现现有分类系统无法反映注意力层中的不同机制；提出新的三分类：利用语言建模能力猜测得出的记忆样本、因训练集中高重复性回忆的记忆样本、以及非记忆样本；并证实部分样本实际上是模型猜测而非记忆的结果。

Conclusion: 新的记忆分类方法更能与注意力权重匹配，揭示模型需对猜测样本与记忆样本分开研究，并提供了一种可视化技术以进一步理解记忆机制。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种数据驱动的混合管道EHSAN，结合ChatGPT伪标注与人工审查，构建首个可解释的阿拉伯语医疗领域方面情感分析数据集，并通过实验验证了其在分类任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和缺乏方面级情感标注而难以自动分析。本研究旨在弥补这一空白，为医疗领域构建可解释的阿拉伯语情感分析数据集。

Method: 提出EHSAN工具，结合ChatGPT伪标注与人工审查，形成包括方面和情感标签（正面、负面或中性）的数据集。并设计监督、半监督和无监督三种数据训练版本，比较它们对模型性能的影响。最后，对Transformer模型进行微调测试。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型即使在最少人工监督下，也能取得高分类准确度。在减少方面类别后，各项分类指标显著提升。实验表明结合大语言模型标注和人工审核是一种高效且可扩展的方法。

Conclusion: 本文方法为阿拉伯语医疗情感分析提供了一种具有高效性、可扩展性和可解释性的新思路。从未来研究来看，可以拓展到不同医院、优化提示词及改进数据驱动建模。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

*Ming Pok Ng,Junqi Jiang,Gabriel Freedman,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MArgE框架，通过结构化方法整合多个大型语言模型（LLMs）的输出用于声明验证，实验表明其性能优于单LLM及其他非结构化多LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前整合多个LLM的方法往往使用无结构的交互方式，容易导致生成结果不具备充分的可解释性，需要一种具有正式结构的方案来整合和验证LLM的输出。

Method: 引入MArgE框架，为每个LLM提供树形结构的论据表示，并使用Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs)创建结构化的论据树以进行声明验证，确保从论证到最终验证决策路径的可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明，MArgE在声明验证任务中显著优于单LLM，包括数种开源模型、GPT-4o-mini和现有ArgLLMs，以及之前的非结构化多LLM辩论方法。

Conclusion: 通过将正式的论证推理机制融入多LLM的整合中，MArgE显著提升了声明验证的性能和结果的可信度，证明了此方法的有效性。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

### [326] [CharBench: Evaluating the Role of Tokenization in Character-Level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02591)
*Omri Uzan,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CharBench，一个大规模的字符级任务基准，用于评估语言模型在字符级任务中的表现，并分析了字的属性及其分词方式对模型性能的影响。研究发现当前语言模型在字符级任务上表现不佳，准确率仅为43.6%，部分任务更低至32.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在处理字符级任务（如计数或定位字符）时表现欠佳，其原因可能与依赖子词单元而非字符有关。但目前关于分词方式对模型表现影响的研究结论不一，需更深入的探讨。

Method: 研究构建了CharBench基准，包括比现有基准大两个数量级的字符级任务，评估了多种主流开源及专有模型。此外，对单词属性与分词方式对模型性能的影响进行了深入分析。

Result: CharBench基准测试表明，现代大型语言模型在字符级任务中的平均准确率为43.6%，部分任务仅32.3%。研究还发现，分词性质与字符计数任务的正确性弱相关，而单词长度与字符计数有更大影响；而对于字符位置理解任务，模型的性能与包含查询字符的代币长度负相关。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在字符级任务上的表现面临巨大挑战，长分词单元可能会影响字符位置信息的准确获取。研究建议未来基于本文方法改进模型性能，推动相关任务的发展。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有奖励模型（RM）在令牌级交互方面不足，导致判断信号容易受到错误注意分配的攻击。提出了“交互蒸馏”框架，通过关注优化改进偏好建模信号的稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法存在令牌级交互不足的问题，导致判断信号易受注意力分布缺陷的影响。

Method: 提出了“交互蒸馏”训练框架，引入以交互为基础的自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，并通过注意力对齐目标指导偏好建模以模拟教师模型的交互模式。

Result: 实验表明，与现有的针对数据噪声优化的RM方法相比，交互蒸馏框架能提供更稳定和更具泛化性的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 注意力分配缺陷是现有奖励模型的基本限制，交互蒸馏框架能显著改善偏好建模信号的问题。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

TL;DR: 提出了Pointer，一种新架构，通过指针链实现线性复杂度的长序列建模，性能出色且无需预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列建模中标准注意力机制的高复杂度问题。

Method: 通过层级指针链追踪，减少操作复杂度，并建立显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列任务中，相较标准变换器速度提升2~10倍，保持>95%的准确率，并学会了可解释的指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer在无需预训练的高效长序列建模场景中，是注意力机制的有力替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Motivation: 近年来多语言基准数据集被半自动化开发，但很少关注数据集质量，作者希望通过分析提高数据集的准确性。

Method: 手动分析法语和泰卢固语的多语言测试数据集，比较原始和修订版本下多个大语言模型的性能表现。

Result: 发现原始与修订版本性能差异显著，有些情况性能差异接近10%。

Conclusion: 测试数据集应被视为可修正、可版本化的，应定期检查数据集正确性，并提出了针对数据集创建者和使用者的改进建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

Conclusion: 这一分类体系为研究人工智能代理能力的变化提供了系统化的视角，为未来系统的评估与发展方向提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments

Motivation: 长期以来“状态”概念缺乏共识和形式化定义，作者希望强化其理论基础，以适用多学科领域，推进对智能等复杂系统的理解。

Method: 提出“层次状态网格”和“中间元宇宙（IMU）”的理论框架，用于明确描述定义者及其使用的语言，避免自指和逻辑不一致，并扩展跨数学、语言和代理整合的理论方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了跨数学、物理和语言领域的一致性表示和扩展应用，最终为智能的形式定义及科学理论提供了一个统一的基础框架。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时扩展方法主要针对单阶段任务，而难以处理多阶段复杂任务且分配资源优化困难的问题。

Method: 通过实验证明多阶段任务中LLM行为的三个经验规律，提出AgentTTS框架，基于LLM-Agent与执行环境的反馈交互进行优化。

Result: AgentTTS在搜索效率显著优于传统方法，且对训练集规模变化表现出更强鲁棒性，并提供更高的解释性。

Conclusion: AgentTTS能够高效且鲁棒地在多阶段任务中优化模型和预算分配，为多阶段复杂任务的测试时扩展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbiotic AI的发展加深了人机协作，但带来了更高的伦理风险。这些风险包括对人权和信任的损害，因此需要一种将不确定性、模糊性和不完全信息纳入考虑的灵活且透明的伦理风险评估框架。

Method: 本文提出的ff4ERA框架结合了模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）、确定性因子（CF），通过解析风险水平、专家权重和确定性因子生成伦理风险分数（ERS），以量化伦理风险。

Result: 案例研究证实，ff4ERA框架生成的伦理风险分数具有上下文敏感性和伦理意义，并能够正确反映专家输入和传感器数据。局部敏感性分析表明框架的行为具有可预测性且大多单调，而全局Sobol分析突出专家定义权重和确定性因子的主导影响，验证了模型设计。

systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

### [334] [An analysis of AI Decision under Risk: Prospect theory emerges in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00902)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文测试大型语言模型在不确定性决策中的风险判断，首次验证Kahneman和Tversky的“前景理论”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否展现与人类相似的风险判断特性，检验前景理论的适用性及其在风险决策中的启示。

Method: 通过实验，将前景理论应用于当前最先进的大型语言模型，分析其在不同情境下的风险决策行为和语言框架（frame）的影响。

Result: 研究显示，大型语言模型在某些情境下符合前景理论，风险决策受情境和语言框架影响，尤其在军事情境中表现出更大的框架效应。

Conclusion: 语言模型能够模仿人类的偏见与启发式决策，但这些偏见具有局部性和情境性，强调语言框架的重要性，同时为LLM的推理与记忆辩论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CHECK的知识编辑方法，通过语义分析改善多跳问答中推理链的准确性，并取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识编辑方法在处理需要逻辑推理的复杂任务中表现不佳，如多跳问答（MQA）。本文试图通过端到端的语义分析方法改善此问题。

Method: 提出CHECK方法，将推理过程类比于编译流程，先进行语义分析以识别推理链中的语义错误，然后通过逻辑优化和高温重新提示来修正这些问题。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验显示，CHECK相较于五种前沿框架，实现了平均22.8%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: CHECK方法通过引入语义分析的方式显著提升了多跳问答任务中的知识编辑性能，并为处理其他需要推理复杂性的任务提供了潜在的启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

advancement in multi-agent AI for autonomous systems.

Conclusion: AutoEDA作为开源框架显示了为EDA领域自动化带来的潜力，其标准化和可扩展性对现有工作流提供了支持。

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.
AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA
community. Available at: https://github.com/AndyLu666/MCP-EDA-Server

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文提出了REACT，一个基于轻量级视觉-语言模型（VLM）的实时V2X集成轨迹优化框架，用于提升自动驾驶系统的安全性和响应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多车碰撞中人类错误是主要原因，需要自动驾驶系统通过V2X通信扩展感知能力。当前的V2X模型存在泛化能力差、上下文推理浅和单模态输入限制等问题，传统VLM虽然具有多模态集成能力，但难以满足实时性能要求。

Method: 提出REACT框架，基于精调的轻量级VLM，集成专业模块处理多模态输入生成优化风险感知轨迹，并通过边缘设备适配策略减小模型复杂度，加快推理速度。

Result: 在DeepAccident基准测试中，REACT取得了77%的碰撞率降低，48.2%的视频全景质量，推理延迟为0.57秒，达到了性能领先水平。

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM在边缘实时协作规划中是可行的，语言引导的情境推理有助于提高自动驾驶的安全性和响应性。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有的知识图谱嵌入技术在生成大规模嵌入时存在效率和可扩展性问题，需探索更快速有效的实现方法。

Method: 提出gpuRDF2vec，通过使用现代GPU和支持多节点架构，优化RDF2vec流程中的每个阶段，并基于Pytorch Lightning实现可扩展的word2vec。

Result: 实验表明gpuRDF2vec较现有方法（如jRDF2vec）具有显著速度优势，尤其是在大图和高密度图上的随机漫步提取阶段表现优异。

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec能在有限时间内训练大型知识图谱的高质量嵌入，为研究者和实践者提供了一种强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI输出可能无意中从正确转变为误导性，这已经对社会和经济造成巨大损失，需要合理的解释和解决方案。

Method: 通过将AI的行为映射到多自旋热力学系统，提出了一种模型，定义了AI输出‘翻转点’的公式，并分析了其被多层架构放大的机制。

Result: 明确定义了AI输出不稳定的数学公式，展示了用户提示和训练偏差对输出可靠性的直接影响。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提升了AI透明性和可解释性，也为定量评估用户使用AI的风险及法律责任提供了思路。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Motivation: 探索社会经济指标是否能通过卫星影像和互联网来源文本反映，并用于预测特定地区的家庭财富水平。

Method: 利用非洲地区的人口健康调查数据，将卫星影像与LLM生成的描述文本和AI搜索代理从网络检索到的文本结合，开发多模态框架，使用五个预测流水线来估算家庭财富。

Result: 多模态框架融合影像和文本大幅提升预测准确度（R方从0.63提升至0.77），并揭示视觉和语言模态的潜在对物质状况的共同解码结构。

Conclusion: 结合视觉和语言信息可增强预测社会经济指标的表现，发布了一个包含超60,000个数据点的大规模多模态数据集，对研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型虽然在轨迹预测中表现优异，但难以保留已学习的知识，限制了其在连续变化场景下的应用。

Method: 利用海马回路记忆重放机制的思想，开发了H2C方法，通过选择性回忆部分学习样本（包括基于样本多样性选择和等概率采样两种策略）并使用记忆重放损失函数更新模型，从而保留知识并适应新数据。

Result: 实验基于INTERACTION数据集多场景设计表明，H2C方法在无分布转移提示下，可使深度学习模型的灾难性遗忘减少22.71%。

Conclusion: H2C方法在轨迹预测任务中有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，为自动驾驶系统在不同场景中的应用提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

Conclusion: MoSEAR框架有效缓解了模态冲突问题，同时提升了模态一致样本的表现，实现了平衡的多模态整合。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）中的链式推理（CoT）是否是由训练数据分布学到的偏置所引导，从而分析了其有效性在训练和测试数据分布不一致时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前研究表明，链式推理可以提升LLM在任务上的表现，但其推理过程可能并不像看起来那样具有深度。这激励作者探讨链式推理的本质以及其可能性和局限性。

Method: 引入了一个名为DataAlchemy的控制环境，在各种数据分布条件下从零训练LLM，并通过任务、长度和格式三个维度考察链式推理的特性。

Result: 实验表明，链式推理是脆弱的，当其超出训练分布范围时，模型表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 链式推理的成功依赖于训练数据分布，模型无法实现真正具备一般化能力的推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

*Mingchen Mei,Yi Li,YiYao Qian,Zijun Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的故障检测方法，将显著性检验与保序预测框架相结合，以提供形式化的风险保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诊断模型在面对复杂场景（如分布漂移）时缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 该方法基于模型残差定义非一致性度量，将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，并利用校准数据集计算样本的p值，构建具有用户指定概率$1-\alpha$的预测集。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在跨领域故障诊断任务中具有理论支持的性质，同时即使点预测模型性能较差，也能保持预测集的经验覆盖率不低于预期。

Conclusion: 研究为故障检测引入了一个理论基础框架，使得诊断系统在安全关键应用中更可信，并推动了从点预测到不确定性感知输出的转变。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将手绘草图转换为结构化图表是一项高效传达思想的需求，但现有方法高度依赖人工处理，因草图缺乏结构性和语义精确度。

Method: 设计并实现了一个集成草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证的多智能体系统SketchAgent。还提出了Sketch2Diagram Benchmark用于评估，包含8种图表类型和6000多个高质量标注样本。

Result: 实现了从手绘草图到结构化图表的自动化过程，显著降低人工工作量，并帮助评估多样化图表生成效果。

Conclusion: SketchAgent显著推动了草图到结构化图表生成的自动化进程，为设计、教育和工程领域的应用提供了潜力支持。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新模型MoE-MLA-RoPE，通过结合专家混合（MoE）、多头潜在注意力（MLA）和旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）实现高效的语言建模，显著提升推理速度和减少内存占用，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在计算效率与模型容量之间的基本权衡问题。

Method: 采用三大创新：(1) 细粒度微专家路由实现灵活的模型专化；(2) 专家隔离策略分离常见模式与专用专家路由；(3) 无梯度冲突的负载均衡机制，优化专家利用率。

Result: 实验表明，MoE-MLA-RoPE在多个参数范围内显著节省内存（68%）并提升推理速度（3.2倍），同时生成质量在一致性（8.1/10），创造性（7.9/10）以及语法正确性（8.2/10）上获得GPT-4评估的较高分数。

Conclusion: 在有限资源的模型部署中，与其扩展参数规模，创新的架构设计更为关键。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Motivation: 探索成员推断攻击在小型语言模型上的表现机制，并改善当前攻击方法以应对小型模型带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为win-k的新型成员推断攻击方法，并在多个数据集和小型语言模型上与现有方法进行实验对比。

Result: 实验表明，win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR、FPR @ 99% TPR等评价指标上均超越现有技术，尤其是对小型语言模型攻击效果更优。

Conclusion: win-k方法增强了针对小型语言模型的成员推断攻击能力，可为隐私及知识产权保护领域提供新的参考。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KCR框架，通过引导LLMs选择逻辑一致性更强的上下文，解决长上下文中的知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的兴起，多源知识冲突的频率增加，其中跨上下文的知识冲突尤为让模型困惑。需要一种方法帮助LLMs更加有效地解决这种冲突。

Method: 提出了KCR框架，通过提取推理路径并使用强化学习奖励模型选择正确的推理路径，从而训练模型生成正确的逻辑推理过程。

Result: 实验证明，该框架在解决长上下文知识冲突上显著提高了模型性能。

Conclusion: KCR框架增强了LLMs在长上下文场景下解决知识冲突的能力，表现出显著性能进步。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Motivation: 目前大多评估基准未考虑繁体中文三模态评估及推理延迟问题。

Method: 提出包含900道选择题的Multi-TW基准，数据来源于华语文能力测试，并对多种开放及封闭源多模态模型进行评估。

Result: 评估显示封闭源模型在多模态上普遍优于开放源模型，但开放源在音频任务上表现良好。端到端多模态管道在延迟方面优于单独音频转录的视觉-语言模型。

Conclusion: Multi-TW基准全面展示了模型能力，突出了在繁体中文数据上的微调及高效多模态结构的需求。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化方法在生成新颖且有依据的假设时表现有限，缺乏迭代优化及未来潜力评估。

Method: BioDisco通过语言模型推理、多模式证据系统（生物医学知识图谱和自动化文献检索）、内部评分反馈循环、及时间和人类评价验证性能支持假设生成。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，BioDisco具有更高的新颖性和科学意义。

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个灵活模块化的工具，可支持科研人员快速发现新假设。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理和规划能力备受关注，其在非结构化规划问题上的表现引起了AI规划领域的研究兴趣。

Method: 作者提出了一个基于NLP的恢复管道，用于分析和改进LLMs生成的计划，包括三个恢复阶段和一个符号规划器的整合。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs生成的计划执行质量低下，平均只有前2.65个动作可执行，但通过提出的恢复管道，成功率有所提升，从21.9%提高至27.5%。

Conclusion: 尽管恢复机制和分析能提升行动质量，但LLMs在计划生成中仍缺乏可靠性，与经典规划器相比差距明显。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型被广泛应用，其安全性问题变得至关重要，特别是面对越狱攻击的威胁，因此需要探讨更有效的越狱方法与防御手段。

Method: 提出PUZZLED方法，它将有害指令中的关键词掩藏，设计三种谜题形式（单词搜索、字谜和填字游戏）供LLM解答，进而还原并执行有害指令。

Result: 在五种先进LLM中测试，PUZZLED的平均攻击成功率高达88.8%，其中GPT-4.1的成功率为96.5%，Claude 3.7 Sonnet为92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过利用LLM的推理能力，将熟悉的谜题转变为有效的越狱攻击手段，展示了现有模型在面对此类攻击时的安全漏洞。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 理论证明了至少存在一个稳定平衡状态，并推导出独特性的温和单调条件。基于2025到2045年模拟，预测自动化比例将从10%上升到65%，但约1/3任务仍由人类完成，即人类将更专注于监督和整合AI任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过政策鼓励人与AI团队合作，可以提升经济福利并实现资源优化分配，同时对技能发展和AI治理具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Conclusion: 本文为GUI代理领域制定了严格的评估标准和高质量数据集，为未来发展指明了研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

*Yuanzhe Shen,Kaimin Wang,Changze Lv,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了TripTailor，一种用于真实世界情境下个性化旅行规划的基准数据集，包含50多万个POI及近4000个旅行行程，用以改善现有评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅行业对个性化、高质量行程规划的需求日益增加，现有基准和评估标准采用模拟数据，难以全面评估旅行规划质量。

Method: 研发了TripTailor基准数据集，包含大规模真实数据及多样化行程，同时对当前LLMs生成的行程进行实验评估。

Result: 最新LLMs仅有不到10%的行程达到人类水平表现，揭示了旅行规划中可行性、合理性及个性化等多项关键挑战。

Conclusion: TripTailor能够促进开发理解用户需求并生成实际可行行程的旅行规划模型，其代码和数据集已开源以推动研究进展。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 在NLP任务中，文本与图表的关系推理是核心，但二者相互作用的详细机制及其对模型效果的影响尚未充分探讨。

Method: 通过支持知识协同蒸馏的统一架构，分析文本与图表表示的互补性，研究五种涉及关系推理的任务，通过追踪训练过程中表现的演变揭示模式。

Result: 发现文本和图表表示在训练中的对齐和分歧模式，阐明二者整合带来的好处。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了整合文本与图表信息的有效时机和原因，为构建复杂的混合模型提供指导。

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Motivation: 解决电动车因电池容量有限导致的充电计划与路径规划难题，提高城市配送效率。

Method: 证明问题NP难后，提出MILP精确解法及高效启发式方法，并通过真实数据集验证方法效率。

Result: 与基线策略相比，CARGO框架可减少EDF 39%和NDF 22%的充电成本，同时完成相近的配送任务。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在优化电动车路径规划及充电计划方面具有显著优势，有助于推进可持续物流。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

*Jingtian Yan,Stephen F. Smith,Jiaoyang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了kTPG与WinkTPG方法，用于优化多智能体路径规划，解决了传统方法因简化动力学模型导致问题。实验表明该方法可有效提高路径规划效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAPF算法由于依赖于简化的动力学模型，导致生成的路径规划在实际应用中不可直接执行。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为kTPG的算法，用于将MAPF计划优化为动力学可行的路径，并在此基础上开发了WinkTPG框架，通过窗口化方法逐步优化并动态调整路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，WinkTPG可以在1秒内生成多达1,000个智能体的速度配置，并且相比现有路径规划方法提高了解决方案质量达51.7%。

Conclusion: WinkTPG能够高效处理多智能体动态路径规划问题，兼顾路径优化质量和计算效率，是MAPF领域的重大改进。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

*Derin Cayir,Renjie Tao,Rashi Rungta,Kai Sun,Sean Chen,Haidar Khan,Minseok Kim,Julia Reinspach,Yue Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Refine-n-Judge的方法，利用单个大型语言模型（LLM）作为数据集的改进者和评估者，通过自动迭代的方式提升数据集质量，无需人工注释或额外的奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好微调所依赖的高质量数据集通常需要大量的人类反馈，这过程成本高且难以扩展，因此需要一种自动化和高效的方案来改进数据质量。

Method: 提出Refine-n-Judge方法，每次迭代中，LLM作为改进者生成数据改进版本并担任评估者对该版本进行审查，直至模型判断原始答案优于改进版本为止，生成高质量且经过偏好标注的数据集。

Result: 通过应用Refine-n-Judge方法，优化后的模型在多个数据集中表现优异，在与GPT-4训练的模型对比中有超过74%的偏好度；性能测试中在几个基准上分别取得了+5%到+19%的性能提升。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge方法证明是一种有效的提高数据集质量和实现模型可扩展性改进的方式，也表明利用LLM自身进行数据评估与改进具有很大的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在高影响情境中的认知偏差表现，发现其偏差表现与社会和组织背景密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在高风险领域的自主决策角色中被广泛使用，研究试图探讨这些模型是否和如何表现出人类认知偏差，尤其是对投资失败方向持续投入的偏差。

Method: 研究设计了一项两阶段投资任务，包含四种实验条件：作为投资者，作为顾问，多代理协商，及综合压力场景，总共进行了6,500次实验以评估LLMs的偏差表现。

Result: 在单独决策条件下，模型展现出较少偏差。但在多代理协商和综合压力场景中，模型表现出显著的升级承诺偏差，例如对称的同级协商情境中偏差达到99.2%。

Conclusion: LLMs的认知偏差并非固有，还需根据社会和组织情境进行了解。这对于多代理系统和自主操作中的模型部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Result: 提出了如何将LLMs能力与表格数据准备相结合的详细分析和建议，覆盖关键任务及应用场景。

Conclusion: LLMs可以显著增强表格数据的准备工作，但仍需深入探索其能力与需求的匹配及有效用法。

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Result: 该方法在零样本泛化到未知LTL规范时表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL能有效处理复杂任务目标与约束，为强化学习带来更广泛的应用可能性。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Conclusion: PCF能够生成针对特定场景的优化代理配置，具有动态性和可扩展性，可用于客户服务、医疗、机器人及合作系统等领域，同时保持逻辑一致性并支持道德AI应用。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

Conclusion: 研究表明，动态建模知识的时间演化对提高长文本问答的鲁棒性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

TL;DR: 本文提出SURE-Med框架，通过减少视觉、分布和语境三个方面的不确定性，提升自动医学报告生成（MRG）的可靠性，在关键数据集MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray上取得了前沿表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学报告自动生成系统因三大不确定性（视觉、标签分布、语境）面临临床部署的信任挑战，亟需改进模型应对这些挑战的能力。

Method: 提出一个统一框架SURE-Med，包括：Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块应对视觉不确定性；Token Sensitive Learning目标处理标签分布不确定性；Contextual Evidence Filter减少语境不确定性。

Result: SURE-Med在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准上表现出色，验证了其从多模态上系统减少不确定性的能力。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过算法创新显著提高了医学报告生成系统的可靠性，为可信临床决策支持奠定了基础。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

Conclusion: 链式思维能有效改进自然语言到可视化生成的整体质量和透明性，帮助用户更好地理解和优化可视化输出。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

*Shijie Cao,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReflecSched框架，通过结合启发式驱动模拟生成的策略经验和大型语言模型（LLM），优化动态柔性作业车间调度问题（DFJSP）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法效率有限且刚性强，深度学习方法需要复杂的特征工程，而直接采用LLM表现欠佳，存在长上下文悖论、未充分利用专家启发式和短视决策等问题。研究动力为提升调度方法的适应性和高效性。

Method: 提出的ReflecSched框架让LLM分析多个规划视角的启发式驱动模拟，并提炼为策略经验，将其融入最后决策模块的提示中，以实现有效的非短视行动。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基线，赢率达71.35%，相对百分比偏差降低2.755%，并超过所有单个启发式方法的表现，同时有效缓解研究中提到的三大问题。

Conclusion: ReflecSched成功证明，将战略经验纳入LLM提示能解决干扰调度问题的挑战，可适用于各种问题场景，表现与最佳启发式方法相当。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为HypoAgents的多智能体协作框架，通过贝叶斯推理和信息熵驱动的闭环机制，实现科学假设的自动生成、验证与优化，比现有的基于大语言模型的方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对科学知识的指数级增长，解决如何生成兼具新颖性、可行性和研究价值的科学假设这一核心挑战。

Method: 提出一个包含假设生成、证据验证和假设优化三个阶段的多智能体协作框架，结合贝叶斯推理与信息熵驱动的搜索机制，实现类似科学家认知过程的闭环迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，在ICLR 2025真实研究问题数据集上，经过12次优化迭代，该框架生成假设的平均ELO分数提高了116.3，超过真实论文摘要基准17.8，同时框架的不确定性显著降低了0.92。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可解释的概率推理框架HypoAgents，可显著提高机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性，为自动科学发现提供新的方法。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供一种能够在各种领域推理架构中支持分析的不依赖于特定推理算法或逻辑体系的框架。

Method: 将推理系统建模为结构化元组，包括现象、解释空间、推理和生成映射以及原则基础。分析框架支持动态行为如迭代优化和原则进化，同时对结构约束下推理的失败模式进行分类。

Result: 框架能够统一逻辑、算法和学习推理过程，核心分析包括一致性、健全性和完备性等内部标准，并识别常见的失败模式如矛盾、不完备性和非收敛性。

Conclusion: 文章提供了一个基础性结构，用于表示和比较推理系统，特别是在内部故障、适应或分裂可能出现时，支持理论与实用应用的进一步研究。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Motivation: 提高大语言模型在复杂数学推理任务中的能力，解决现有方法中奖励数据构建困难的问题。

Method: 提出了基于不确定性驱动的框架，包括数据生成与标注过程，还设计了两种新的不确定性感知输出聚合方法：混合多数奖励投票法和加权奖励频率投票法。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus数据集上的实验验证了提出的奖励数据构建框架的有效性，并证明了新的输出聚合方法能进一步提升数学推理能力。

Conclusion: 应用基于不确定性的方法改进了奖励数据构建和聚合机制，显著提升了多种过程级别奖励模型的表现。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出LiveMCPBench，这是第一个评估LLM代理在大规模、真实工具丰富环境中的综合基准，涵盖95项任务和527种工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准仅限于单服务器设置，无法有效评估代理在大规模、真实世界场景中的能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准，包含LiveMCPTool（70个MCP服务器和527种工具）和LiveMCPEval（自动化评估框架），并设计了MCP Copilot Agent用于动态规划和工具交互。

Result: 评估了10种主流模型，最佳模型Claude-Sonnet-4达到78.95%成功率，但模型间性能差异显著，部分模型表现较差。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench提供了首个在动态、工具丰富的MCP环境中评估LLM代理能力的统一框架，为进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CloudAnoAgent的神经符号LLM代理，用于云环境中的异常检测，通过集成指标和日志数据，提高检测精度并减少误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖于指标数据，常因数据不平衡导致高误报率，同时未能有效结合日志数据。

Method: CloudAnoAgent通过统一管道处理结构化指标和文本日志数据，使用符号验证验证假设并生成结构化异常报告。引入CloudAnoBench基准数据集，以系统性评估方法效果。

Result: 实验显示，CloudAnoAgent相比传统和仅LLM方法分别提升了46.36%和36.67%的异常分类精度，降低了36.67%和33.89%的误报率，在异常类型检测精度上比基础LLM提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent显著提升了检测准确性、减少误报并增强解释性，为企业云环境提供了实用部署支持。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出ProKG Dial框架，用于从特定领域知识图谱中生成高质量的多轮对话数据集，并通过实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在专业领域对话中缺乏精确性，急需高质量领域特定多轮对话数据集的构建。

Method: 利用知识图谱进行框架设计，包括社区检测划分子图，以目标实体为中心生成问答序列，结合严格过滤步骤保证质量，并在医学领域验证生成效果。

Result: 生成对话在多样性、语义连贯性及实体覆盖率方面均表现优秀，通过对预训练模型的微调，有效提升专业领域对话性能。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial框架为构建复杂领域知识对话数据集提供了高效方法，在实践中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于单轮NL到GQL转换，无法有效应对多轮对话和复杂语境的依赖需求。此领域高质量多轮NL2GQL数据集稀缺，限制了研究进展。

Method: 采用大型语言模型（LLMs），自动构建了一个名为MTGQL的多轮NL2GQL数据集，并设计了三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL转换效果。

Result: 成功构建了一个基于金融市场图数据库的多轮NL2GQL数据集MTGQL。

Conclusion: 该研究为多轮NL到GQL转换研究提供了重要的数据支持和评估标准，为未来研究奠定了坚实的基础。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为SNOW的新系统，通过大型语言模型（LLMs）从非结构化的临床笔记中自动生成结构化特征，用于预测健康事件的结果，性能接近人工制作特征，且无需临床专家参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHRs）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但提取有意义的特征仍然具有挑战性。目前的特征生成方法要么劳动密集，要么缺乏解释性和临床相关性。

Method: 提出SNOW（Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow），这是一个模块化多智能体系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现从非结构化笔记到结构化特征的自动生成，而无需人工干预。

Result: 在预测147位患者的五年前列腺癌复发研究中，与手动生成特征一样具有竞争力的性能（AUC-ROC：0.761），并显著优于基线特征和其他自动特征生成方法。

Conclusion: SNOW展示了自动化LLM系统能够在没有临床专家参与的情况下再现专业级别的特征工程，具有解释性和扩展性，有潜力革新临床机器学习对非结构化EHR数据的利用。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraceAlign框架通过量化模型生成内容与训练语料的不一致性，从根源上追踪和缓解大型语言模型的对齐漂移问题，显著降低生成不安全内容的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多经过人类价值对齐微调的大型语言模型在面对对抗性提示、解码扰动或变体越狱时会出现对齐漂移问题，其机制和训练时的内在信念源尚不明确。

Method: 提出TraceAlign框架，其核心工具是“信念冲突指数(BCI)”，用于测量生成内容与对齐政策之间的语义不一致性。此外，开发了TraceShield安全过滤器、对比信念解除损失函数及Prov-Decode溯源解码策略等干预方法。

Result: 通过在Alignment Drift Benchmark数据库上的测试，上述手段在保持模型性能（任务能力降低小于0.2）的前提下，将对齐漂移现象减少了85%。

Conclusion: TraceAlign框架提供了首个可扩展、可溯源的工具包，深入理解并缓解对齐失败现象，并鼓励学术界进一步探索，代码开源以促进发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在精度、上下文理解和稳定性方面均有所改进，为危险识别提供了新的理论和技术支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Result: 通过理论证明与实验证明，在MAC-SPGG框架下，模型协作性能优于单模型和其他协作方法，甚至接近大型模型在多个任务上的表现。

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG为多代理语言生成提供了可扩展和鲁棒的协作机制，提升了多模型协作的实际性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型的智能体在复杂任务中表现出色，但其问题解决过程中的交互轨迹未被充分利用，导致推理重复和次优结果。

Method: 提出了SE-Agent自演化框架，通过修正、重组和优化关键操作，利用智能体前期轨迹改进推理，扩展搜索空间与提高推理质量。

Conclusion: SE-Agent基于自演化推理方法，成功优化智能体的任务解决能力，显著提升了复杂任务中的表现，为智能体研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

*Yiqing Xu,Linfeng Li,Cunjun Yu,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了StackItUp，一个能够从2D手绘草图生成稳定3D结构的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人对复杂3D结构的操作需要精确的3D模型和专业工具，普通用户无法通过手绘草图简单表达。

Method: 引入了抽象关系图描绘符号几何关系及结构稳定性，结合生成性扩散模型，将其转化为稳定的3D位置，并逐步补充隐藏的内部支持结构。

Result: 在著名地标和现代房屋设计的草图测试中，StackItUp能生成稳定且视觉还原度高的多层3D结构，表现优于所有基线。

Conclusion: StackItUp突破了非专业用户通过草图指定3D结构的难题，提升了可用性和效果。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

*Kanghua Mo,Li Hu,Yucheng Long,Zhihao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为吸引元数据攻击（AMA）的新型隐蔽攻击方法，通过修改工具元数据影响大语言模型（LLM）代理的工具选择行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型通过使用外部工具来增强推理和决策能力，但工具元数据的修改可能成为潜在攻击面，本文旨在探讨此隐蔽威胁。

Method: 作者提出了一种黑盒上下文学习框架，可迭代优化生成诱人的、语法和语义合法的工具元数据，进而诱使LLM代理选择恶意工具。

Result: 实验结果显示，AMA攻击在包括10种模拟场景和多种LLM代理中表现出81%-95%的高成功率，同时能实现隐私泄露且对主要任务执行影响微乎其微。

Conclusion: 元数据操控是一个强大且隐蔽的攻击方式，现有防御机制无法有效应对，亟需超越提示层的执行级安全机制。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Motivation: 近年来，复杂任务处理中的出色表现使得LRMs成为研究热点，而DeepSeek R1凭借其优秀性能和开源特性助推了相关研究发展。但模型在推理过程中容易过度思考，影响效率和准确性，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 本文系统回顾了现有高效推理方法，将其分为两大方向：①单一模型的高效推理，旨在优化单个模型的推理效率；②模型协作下的高效推理，通过多个模型的协同优化推理路径。此外，作者还维护了一个公开的GitHub库以追踪最新研究进展。

Conclusion: 可以通过优化单个模型或多模型协作来提升推理效率，同时减少推理路径长度。本研究对高效推理方法的深入探讨为未来的模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的动态掩码稀疏注意力机制(Dynamic Mask Attention, DMA)，以应对长上下文建模的复杂性问题，有效平衡了信息保真性与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在处理长上下文时受限于标准自注意力机制的二次复杂性，尽管稀疏注意力取得了一定效率，但面临静态模式或信息丢失的问题。为此，作者希望设计一种能够动态高效建模长上下文的注意力方法。

Method: 提出了一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制(DMA)，通过动态生成基于内容的稀疏掩码和基于位置的稀疏计算，将重点集中于关键信息，并跳过不必要的计算区域，从而实现双稀疏设计，降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，在Chinchilla Scaling Law设定下，DMA在困惑度(perplexity)上优于多头注意力、滑动窗口注意力等方法。在多查询联合回忆任务和一个1.7B参数模型的基准与任务性能测试中，DMA展示了显著优于多头注意力的表现和效率。

Conclusion: DMA通过动态稀疏注意力机制实现了长上下文建模能力与计算效率的平衡，为高效的长上下文处理提供了一种新的设计方案，验证了其卓越的性能。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨如何将情感弧这一普遍叙事结构应用于程序化游戏叙事生成，提升故事和游戏动态的交互性和情感共鸣。

Method: 使用大规模语言模型（LLMs）和自适应实体生成技术，构建以情感弧为核心的分支叙事图；将关键节点自动化生成包含角色、物品及游戏相关属性的内容，并调整游戏难度以匹配情感轨迹。

Result: 通过玩家评分、访谈和情感分析，结果表明情感弧的整合显著增强了游戏的参与感、叙事连贯性和情感影响力。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的程序生成方法在提升交互式游戏叙事方面具有巨大潜力，为未来游戏叙事生成的研究开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Result: 方法有效地压缩了推理轨迹长度，准确率损失最小，且在问答和代码生成等跨领域任务中得到良好泛化。

Conclusion: 外部冗余可安全移除而不影响性能，内部冗余需更谨慎削减。方法提升了推理效率，并实现了对推理长度的隐性语义控制，促进了简洁和可解释的推理模型发展。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Conclusion: 提出了一个通向跨认知领域的类脑智能理论基础，有助于缩小人工智能与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Conclusion: 此方法有效融合主动推理理论与实际实现，证明了认知先验在人工智能体中的效率。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Motivation: 当前ATC训练场景的手动设计过程繁琐且限制了模拟多样性，需要一种自动化且高效的生成方式。

Method: 提出AirTrafficGen方法，采用基于图的表示方式将空域拓扑结构（包括几何、航线、航点）编码为LLM可处理的格式，通过工程化提示语控制生成场景的各种属性，并用LLM迭代优化场景。

Result: 通过严谨的基准测试，证明AirTrafficGen可以利用如Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3等模型生成具有高流量且操作真实的ATC训练场景。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，满足了生成更多样化ATC训练模拟的需求，同时展现了LLMs在安全关键领域复杂任务规划中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Traffic-R1，一种具有类人推理能力的交通信号控制(TSC)基础模型，通过强化学习和专家指导在模拟环境中开发，具有零样本泛化能力、轻量化架构和可解释性，并大幅优化交通信号性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSC方法在泛化能力、实时性和可解释性上存在不足，同时实际需要更高效和智能的信号管理方法以缓解城市交通拥堵。

Method: 提出采用强化学习与专家指导结合的方法，在模拟交通环境中通过大规模语言模型的自我探索和迭代开发Traffic-R1，并设计一种同步通信网络提升多路口协调能力。

Result: Traffic-R1实现了更优的零样本泛化能力、显著减少了计算资源需求，并可解释且支持多路口信号协调操作，在实践中日均管理信号55,000+次，平均减少队列时间5%以上，减半操作员工作量。

Conclusion: Traffic-R1通过类人推理与创新架构，突破了传统方法在泛化、实时性能和可解释性上的限制，成为一个高效实用的新型TSC解决方案，并提供开源支持。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Abstract: Composable AI offers a scalable and effective paradigm for tackling complex
AI tasks by decomposing them into sub-tasks and solving each sub-task using
ready-to-use well-trained models. However, systematically evaluating methods
under this setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
CABENCH, the first public benchmark comprising 70 realistic composable AI
tasks, along with a curated pool of 700 models across multiple modalities and
domains. We also propose an evaluation framework to enable end-to-end
assessment of composable AI solutions. To establish initial baselines, we
provide human-designed reference solutions and compare their performance with
two LLM-based approaches. Our results illustrate the promise of composable AI
in addressing complex real-world problems while highlighting the need for
methods that can fully unlock its potential by automatically generating
effective execution pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型在工业PHM领域潜力巨大，但现有评估方法存在结构和完整性不足，制约了两者的深入结合。

Method: 提出PHM-Bench，基于基础能力、核心任务和全生命周期的三元结构，设计多层次评估指标，覆盖知识理解、算法生成和任务优化；并结合案例和公开数据集开展多维评估。

Result: PHM-Bench实现了对通用模型和领域特化模型的多维度评估，涵盖故障诊断、RUL预测等典型PHM任务。

Conclusion: PHM-Bench为LLM在PHM领域的规模化评估提供了方法论基础，并为通用模型向PHM特化转型提供了关键基准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OptiHive是一个基于LLM的框架，可以从自然语言描述中高效生成优化问题的高质量求解器，无需迭代修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM求解方案虽然有前景，但因不可靠且依赖耗时的迭代修正，需要改进效率和性能。

Method: OptiHive通过单次批处理LLM查询生成问题求解器、问题实例和验证测试，再通过过滤及统计模型评估生成的组件质量，从而提供高质量结果。

Result: 在多种优化问题上展示了优越性能，特别是在复杂问题上将最优率从5%提升到92%。

Conclusion: OptiHive解决了LLM模型求解快速性和准确性的问题，为优化问题自动求解提供了有效新方案。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PI的新框架，用于实时的测试时提示干预，实现更短、更可靠的推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大模型推理路径经常包含冗余内容，问题在于后续训练过于依赖结果奖励，而过程奖励的数据难以大规模构建。

Method: 设计PI框架，通过‘何时’模块、‘如何’模块与‘选择’模块对推理路径进行动态干预与引导，实现了人类问题解决经验与认知科学原则的整合。

Result: PI显著缩短了推理链条，减少了幻觉现象，同时使推理更加简洁和可靠。

Conclusion: 使用PI框架可以为大语言模型推理提供更好控制性与可解释性，同时提高推理效率和质量。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)预测脑MRI中的胎龄(PMA)，并生成相关解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在预测PMA方面准确性高，但缺乏透明性和可解释性。不透明的预测过程限制了其在临床中的支持作用。

Method: 作者提出一种基于指令微调和低秩适配(LoRA)的方法，对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行参数高效微调。该模型使用4个从新生儿脑MRI提取的2D皮质表面投影图进行训练，并在推理时通过不同的提示生成回归预测和临床解释。

Result: 微调后的模型在胎龄预测中达到95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周的低误差，生成的解释与发育特征一致，增强了透明性。

Conclusion: 该研究在提高AI模型准确性与透明性之间取得平衡，为围产期神经科学中的可信AI系统发展迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为CAMA的两阶段因果框架，通过应用于LLMs旨在改进复杂数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在数学推理尤其是复杂问题上表现不佳，主要由于深层结构依赖难以处理。

Method: 提出了CAMA框架，其中包括学习阶段通过MCG图构建数学因果结构，并通过迭代反馈优化；在推理阶段动态抽取相关子图，利用其指导LLM推理。

Result: 实证研究表明，CAMA显著提高了LLMs在复杂数学问题上的表现，并证明引入结构化指导效果优于非结构化方法。

Conclusion: CAMA通过因果结构的使用，有效增强了LLMs的数学推理能力，显示出因果关系在解决复杂问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI代理在医疗研究中表现受限于静态的预定义策略，亟需开发能够自我进化的AI系统以应对复杂领域的挑战。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，一个能够通过元层次的进化机制自我优化高阶问题解决策略的AI代理。同时设计了一个新的基准EHRFlowBench，基于复杂、真实医疗数据分析任务。

Result: 实验表明，HealthFlow显著优于现有的顶级AI代理框架。

Conclusion: 研究推动了从提高工具使用能力到设计更智能、自我进化任务管理者的范式转变，为科学发现中新型自动化AI系统的开发铺平了道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 探讨用户为何在与生成式AI系统互动时会赋予其意图性、能动性，甚至内在性。

Method: 通过跨学科框架，借助LLM上下文认知场等概念，分析生成式AI在语言表征中的表现及其与人类的互动。

Result: 澄清了LLM如何通过语义的关系构建和一致性生成“能动性”的效果，以及Noosemia的核心特征。

Conclusion: 讨论了Noosemia在哲学、认识论和社会领域的宽泛影响，并提出未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理如何在电子商务中做出购物决策，以及这种行为对卖家策略和市场的影响。

Method: 开发一个叫ACES的沙盒环境，结合平台无关的VLM代理和可编程市场，随机化商品位置、价格、评级等因素进行实验分析。

Result: 发现AI模型展示出与位置、价格、标签、评价等相关的偏好，但模型之间表现存在差异，并验证了卖家通过调整商品描述获取市场份额的可能性。

Conclusion: AI代理在电商市场中能显著影响购物行为，卖家策略、平台设计和监管政策需要适应这种AI主导的生态系统。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于贝叶斯网络的解释方法，在模型的高风险应用中有效确保了决策的公平性和透明性，同时避免了敏感数据的泄露。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Motivation: 解决扩散策略的表示塌缩问题，以提高其在处理复杂机器人操作任务中的表现。

Method: 提出D2PPO，通过分散损失正则化，强制网络学习可区分的表示并避免表示塌缩。

Result: D2PPO在RoboMimic基准测试中相比于SOTA，预训练提高22.7%，微调后提高26.1%，并在复杂任务的机器人实验中表现出高成功率。

Conclusion: D2PPO通过改进的正则化有效解决了表示塌缩问题，在复杂机器操作任务上显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Conclusion: 训练过程中，神经网络会形成稳定且具有普遍适用性的表示结构，这在普遍神经元的存在和持久性中得到验证。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained
GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with
consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout
training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k
steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of
activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Method: 提出了基于正弦波的可学习周期性激活函数PLU，并结合了一种称为Repulsive Reparameterization的创新技术，以维持数值稳定性并防止函数退化为线性。

Result: 在实验中，使用仅包含两个PLU神经元的最小MLP即可完成螺旋分类任务，而使用传统激活函数的网络无法实现。

Conclusion: PLU激活函数实现了从泰勒展开式近似向傅里叶函数合成器的范式转变，通过提升单个神经元的智能来实现参数效率的指数级提高。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPARTA的框架，通过利用脉冲时间动态来实现稀疏注意力，并在更高计算效率的同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的脉冲神经网络主要依赖于速率编码，忽略了脉冲时间信息的富有计算潜力。

Method: 引入SPARTA框架，利用异质神经元动力学和脉冲时间信息，实现基于时间线索的优先化注意力，同时通过竞争性门控机制实现65.4%的稀疏性。

Result: 复杂度从O(N^2)降至O(K^2)且保持高准确率，在DVS-Gesture上的表现为98.78%，在CIFAR10-DVS和CIFAR-10上的表现分别为83.06%和95.3%。

Conclusion: 利用脉冲时间动态的SNN可显著提升计算效率与准确性，SPARTA框架实现了稀疏注意力的新高度，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency
and accuracy.

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学领域的不确定性处理及结果验证提供了一个有原则的解决方案，能更好地支持决策制定与科学研究。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

asymptotic complexity; a geometric method for obtaining discrete embeddings of
an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因需求增长，高速移动物体（如飞机、车辆、火车）在无地面覆盖区域需要可靠的卫星连接，而频繁的信号切换带来挑战，亟需一种提升用户体验的方法。

Method: 使用地球静止轨道（GEO）卫星与飞机间的真实通信数据，采用机器学习算法分析并预测特定位置的网络质量，以问题发生前主动切换网络提升连接性。

Result: 预测模型在测试数据上达到0.97的F1分数，表明机器学习在飞行中的信号质量预测中具有高精度。

Conclusion: 该工作通过实时预测信号质量，改进卫星通信的效率和无缝宽带服务，且模型可拓展至其他移动对象的卫星连接场景。

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Conclusion: 该工作提出的定义和方法将有助于MVTS基础模型的安全使用和更广泛的采用。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Conclusion: FRAM方法在准确性和计算效率上均具有显著优势，为解决复杂图匹配问题提供了一个高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

*Ruichen Xu,Kexin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了变压器在预训练期间如何获取知识以及在推理期间如何提取知识，提出了一个单层变压器框架，通过跟踪梯度动态揭示了知识获取和提取的能力。同时对比验证了理论发现，提出了解决高泛化损失（如幻觉现象）的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变压器模型在知识密集型任务中表现异常优秀，但其在预训练期间知识获取以及微调后知识提取的机制仍然不明确。现有研究主要关注于单层注意力机制模型，然而研究表明MLP在知识存储中也起着关键作用，因此需要进一步完善理论模型。

Method: 提出了一种可追踪梯度动态的单层变压器框架，结合了自注意力和MLP模块，分析其在知识获取和提取中的收敛性和泛化能力，并进一步结合全参数微调及低秩微调对相关现象进行了理论和实验验证。

Result: 通过理论证明，变压器模型在满足特定条件下能在预训练中实现接近最优损失及在微调后实现低泛化误差，从而成功提取事实性知识；若条件不满足，则模型泛化损失高，可能出现幻觉现象。实验验证支持理论结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为变压器预训练及微调中的知识获取和提取机制提供了理论视角，同时为幻觉现象及优化调度等经验现象提供了解释。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为NeuCoReClass AD的框架，结合对比、重建和分类任务的多任务自监督学习方法，用于时间序列异常检测并取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有许多方法依赖单一代理任务和手工特定领域转换，影响模式捕获和泛化能力。

Method: 引入NeuCoReClass AD，利用神经转换生成多样且连贯的增广视图，同时结合对比、重建和分类学习。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，NeuCoReClass AD表现优于传统基线和多数深度学习方法，并能以无监督方式刻画不同异常模式。

Conclusion: 该框架在无需领域特定知识的情况下，成功提升时间序列异常检测的精度及泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 作者提出了PALACE框架，以估算隐藏的推理过程中的token使用量，从而提供可靠的费用审计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业LLM服务隐藏推理过程的中间步骤，却对每个生成的token收取费用，导致token膨胀及潜在过度收费问题，因此需要一种可靠的token审计方法。

Method: PALACE框架能够在无需内部推理痕迹的情况下，通过提示和答案对估算隐藏的推理token数量，并通过GRPO增强的模块进行动态校准以适应不同推理任务。

Result: 实验证明，PALACE在数学、编程、医学和泛推理基准中表现出低相对误差和高预测准确率，支持细粒度的成本审计和膨胀检测。

Conclusion: PALACE通过提供一种预测审计框架，为实现LLM服务的透明性、问责性和用户信任创造了实践路径，提供了重要的第一步。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CaliMatch的方法，通过校准分类器和OOD检测器，提高了安全半监督学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决半监督学习中的标签分布不匹配问题，提出一种更安全和有效的方法。

Method: 提出了CaliMatch方法，使用自适应标签平滑和温度缩放技术，改善分类器和OOD检测器的校准性能，从而提升安全半监督学习的效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、SVHN、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验中，CaliMatch相比现有方法在安全半监督学习任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 改进分类器和OOD检测器的校准性能是提升安全半监督学习的关键，CaliMatch在多个基准数据集上证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种动态、自动化和系统化（DAS）的红队测试框架，用于持续性压力测试大语言模型（LLMs），以评估其在临床实践中的安全性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs发展迅速，静态安全基准往往在发布后即过时，难以全面、准确地反映模型的可信度，尤其在临床应用中可能引发风险和患者伤害。

Method: 作者开发了DAS红队测试框架，通过自动化对抗性代理生成测试案例、进化触发不安全策略及评估模型响应，在无需人为干预的情况下，动态揭示LLMs在鲁棒性、隐私性、公平性与幻觉等四大安全关键领域的漏洞。

Result: 在对15个专有和开源LLMs的测试中，即使超过80%的MedQA静态准确率下，有94%的答案未能通过动态鲁棒性测试。此外，隐私泄露场景中失败率达86%，偏见影响占81%，幻觉率则超66%。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs的风险水平与临床实践需求不符。DAS红队测试通过将红队测试转变为动态压力测试审计，提供了一种可扩展、可演化的安全保障，为医疗AI的下一代应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Motivation: 现有方法通常对多模态数据单独处理，缺乏对时间依赖性和复杂结构关系的有效建模，导致分类表现受到限制。

Method: 通过分割数据为时间段，并构建异构图节点；利用超图卷积捕捉高阶依赖，同时通过时间对齐与图注意力实现语义融合。

Result: 在四个多模态数据集上取得了全新的SOTA效果，证明了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合超图网络能更好地捕捉时间和跨模态依赖性，适用于处理复杂的多模态分类任务。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有特征重要性方法无法有效解析复杂系统中高阶效应的协作或冗余作用，而Hi-Fi方法试图解决这一问题。

Method: 利用适应性版本的LOCO方法，一种分析随机变量协作与冗余的框架，提出了一种能分配三种评分（独特性、冗余性、协同性）的新方法，并与Shapley效应对比验证了其有效性。

Result: 发现臭氧（$O_3$）和二氧化氮（$NO_2$）的特征协同性与阿尔兹海默症病死率相关，特别是在Bergamo和Brescia省份。此外，城市绿地密度也表现出与污染物的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了Hi-Fi是了解复杂系统中高阶关系和解释AI模型的一种新工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在海表温度预测中未充分利用领域内丰富的海洋学知识，且尚无将大语言模型（LLMs）应用于该领域的系统研究。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），通过图嵌入网络学习海洋领域知识，并与数值SST数据融合，最后利用预训练的大语言模型进行SST模式建模和预测。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM首次系统性将海洋知识图谱与大语言模型结合，为海表温度预测提供了新的解决方案，并表现出巨大的发展潜力。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

Conclusion: FeatureCuts在保持模型表现优越的同时减少了计算资源需求，适用于企业级大规模数据集场景。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Conclusion: 无对比预训练即可实现高效、有效的多模态嵌入，显著减少训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Result: 实验表明U^2QT在多个下游任务（例如预测和推荐）上性能优于传统方法，同时提高了存储和计算的效率。

Conclusion: U^2QT统一的Token化框架支持与语言模型集成，适用于工业规模应用。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Motivation: 零样本分类在知识动态变化的领域很具挑战性，例如分类系统。在缺乏数据和主题边界不明确的情况下，大语言模型难以泛化。

Method: 通过结合迭代主题优化、对比提示和主动学习，并引入人工反馈机制，逐步优化分类模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过提示驱动的语义推理方法，即使在有限监督下，该框架也在细粒度分类任务上表现出极佳能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 引入改进的物理引导神经网络框架以解决高维数据训练中的可扩展性问题，使用降阶建模技术和模型重用策略提升性能与效率，同时验证其对噪声的鲁棒性和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在已有的PGNNIV模型中，虽然能够利用可观测数据揭示内部状态关系，但在处理高维空间或时间演化系统时面临扩展性问题，亟需找到可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出改进的PGNNIV框架，通过引入基于光谱分解、POD和预训练自编码器的降阶解码器结构，结合迁移学习和微调策略，提高可扩展性、计算效率和模型适配性。

Result: 改进后的PGNNIV不仅能够准确识别底层状态关系，还在预测准确性、对噪声的鲁棒性以及计算效率方面取得显著提升，同时有效缓解了过拟合现象。

Conclusion: 增强型PGNNIV框架能够因地制宜地应用于多种场景，针对数据和资源情况在解决可扩展性问题以及确保模型性能方面展现了强大的适应能力。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Motivation: 解决大型神经网络模型在训练与推理过程中的能效问题，支持可持续的大规模机器学习工作负载。

Method: 提出phantom parallelism方法，设计新的前后向传播操作，将其实现为自定义autograd操作，并在端到端的phantom并行训练流水线中进行比较分析，验证其性能与能效优势。

Result: 在多达256个GPU上的实验表明，与传统张量并行方法相比，phantom parallelism训练FFN模型的能耗减少约50%，且能在更少的GPU设备上完成训练，进一步节省能源。

Conclusion: phantom parallelism方法为提升大型神经网络模型训练的能源效率提供了有效的解决方案，对实现更可持续的机器学习工作负载具有重要意义。

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Motivation: 个人投资者面对海量信息和缺乏专业分析的劣势，传统LLMs在应对实时性和财务数据复杂性上的不足，促使作者探索新的方法改进财务分析。

Method: 提出FinKario数据集，实时整合公司基本面和市场事件，采用自动化提示驱动的信息提取方法；设计两阶段图结构（FinKario-RAG）检索策略，提高大型规模财务知识获取效率和准确性。

Result: 实验显示，结合FinKario和FinKario-RAG的预测准确率显著提升，股票趋势预测比传统金融LLMs和机构战略分别高出18.81%和17.85%。

Conclusion: 通过构建结构化实时财务知识图谱和优化检索方法，可以有效弥补传统方法的不足，显著提升投资者的财务分析能力。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种关于多模态深度学习在生物医学信号分类中的全新视角，研究发现融合多域特征未必总是有效，强调特征域的互补性质量比数量更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究传统方法认为融合多种模态会增强分类性能，但发现并非所有融合都有效，需要更系统地分析特征域的互补性。

Method: 设计开发并验证了五种深度学习模型，包括三种单模态（1D-CNN、2D-CNN、1D-CNN-Transformer）和两种多模态（结合不同模态的Hybrid1和Hybrid2）。

Result: Hybrid 1在所有分类性能指标上优于基线模型，Hybrid 2因冗余未提供额外改进，进一步通过消融研究验证了结论。

Conclusion: 提出质量高于数量的全新多模态设计原则，提供量化框架，强调模态间信息互补性是优化性能的核心。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决自然语言推理（NLI）模型中的弱点，通过自动化方法生成高质量的对抗数据以增强模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一个三阶段管道：1）通过语义（BGE）和词汇（BM25）相似性进行数据检索；2）利用大语言模型（LLM）生成对抗性假设，并通过LLM集群验证标签的一致性；3）将验证的对抗样本逐步加入训练集进行再训练。

Result: 在标准基准上，VAULT使RoBERTa-base模型在SNLI上从88.48%提升到92.60%（+4.12%），在ANLI上从75.04%提升到80.95%（+5.91%），在MultiNLI上从54.67%提升到71.99%（+17.32%），并在多个数据集上相比现有方法提高了最多2.0%的精度。

Conclusion: VAULT 通过大规模自动化生成优质的对抗数据，实现了快速且无需人工干预的NLI任务鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI
inference tasks.

Result: MORPHEUS在大型癌症数据集上超越现有方法，在不同模态组合与任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是一种有望推动肿瘤学多模态基础模型发展的框架，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM推理系统独有的两阶段计算结构，现有的调度策略无法满足高效性需求，因此需要开发新的理论框架和优化调度策略。

Method: 提出资源感知动态调度器（RAD）和服务水平目标感知LLM推理调度器（SLAI），并基于两者实施相应的优化以应对不同服务约束。

Result: 通过在实际数据集和硬件平台上的实验，SLAI相较于现有方法，显著减少了延迟（TTFT减少53%）并提高了系统最大服务能力（增加26%）。

Conclusion: 基于本文提出的调度策略可以显著提升LLM推理系统的服务能力，同时满足服务延迟的关键约束。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在欧几里得空间内对严格的层次化对象建模效果差，如分类学、词义或文件系统的建模等，需要一种更加适配的方法。

Conclusion: v-PuNNs提供了具有高度解释性、效率高的层次数据建模方法，并推动了数论与深度学习的结合。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Conclusion: MA-PROPS可以有效解决因联合采样误差导致的次优收敛问题，提高多智能体强化学习中的策略梯度算法表现。

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

Babai's well-known nearest-plane algorithm. We furthermore provide geometric
intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

Conclusion: 这种方法可有效处理不确定性，并为高维动力系统建模提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Conclusion: 首次提出结合用户分类属性的树状推荐框架，兼顾语义可解释性，在工业级应用中表现出显著效果。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Motivation: 伪随机数生成器是大型语言模型优化中的关键模块，而Transformer在处理复杂非线性关系方面的优势使其成为可能改进伪随机数生成的一种方法。

Method: 利用带有Chain-of-Thought的仅解码Transformer模型理论上模拟线性同余生成器和梅森旋转伪随机数生成器，并进行实验验证输出结果的随机性和抗预测攻击能力。

Result: 基于Transformer的伪随机数生成器通过了大多数NIST测试，其热图显示了比较理想的统计随机性特征。

Conclusion: 证明了Transformer在伪随机数生成中的潜力，其表现出色且有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法DisTaC（Distillation for Task vector Conditioning），通过知识蒸馏预处理任务向量，以改善现有模型合并技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型合并方法在高度有利的基准套件上表现出色，但它们在更现实条件下的稳健性未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了DisTaC方法，通过知识蒸馏调整任务向量的范数，并提高源模型信心，同时保留任务特定的知识。

Result: 实验表明，采用DisTaC方法预处理任务向量后，现有模型合并技术能够成功整合具有不利特性的模型，并取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: DisTaC方法增强了模型合并的稳健性，使其适用于整合具有挑战性的源模型，解决了现有技术的关键问题。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S)框架解决终生模仿学习中能力遗忘和新能力学习间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法忽视技能遗忘和新技能学习内在相关性的局限性，提出一个统一框架。

Method: 通过令牌化模型参数，将传统transformer中的线性参数映射转变为输入和可学习令牌之间的交叉注意力，增强扩展性，并引入语言引导的技能扩展以提升任务间知识转移效率。

Result: T2S防止遗忘（NBT平均为1.0%），在终生任务中的可训练参数仅增加8.0%，并在任务间知识转移中达到了77.7%的FWT。

Conclusion: T2S框架是一种有效解决终生模仿学习问题的方案，在任务遗忘、扩展性和知识转移方面表现卓越。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

### [464] [MARS: A Meta-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Portfolio Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01173)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MARS的强化学习框架，旨在通过多代理和风险感知的方法实现股票投资中的风险与收益平衡，在国际主要股票指数实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动化投资管理中，强化学习模型难以适应市场动态变化，尤其是在风险与回报平衡方面存在挑战。

Method: MARS框架使用异构代理集合，其中每个代理具有不同的风险偏好，并由安全批评网络和风险容忍阈值调控。同时，通过高层的元自适应控制器动态协调代理以应对不同的市场状态。

Result: 实验表明，与传统方法相比，MARS在国际股指实验中显著降低最大回撤和波动率，且保持了竞争力的收益效果。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过多样的代理行为代替市场特征工程，实现了在市场波动中风险与收益的优异平衡，为自动化投资管理提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提供了一种新的风险寻求政策优化方法（RSPO），用于直接优化Pass@k和Max@k指标，解决了现有大语言模型训练和评估中风险偏好不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型的训练目标和评估指标的风险偏好不匹配。训练过程优化的是期望奖励，但评估指标却依赖于风险寻求的Pass@k和Max@k。

Method: 提出RSPO方法，利用k次采样中响应成为最大值的封闭概率公式，通过生成高效无偏的梯度估计器来优化Pass@k和Max@k指标，解决了“搭便车”问题。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证证明了RSPO方法能够有效地解决风险偏好的优化问题。

Conclusion: RSPO为优化测试阶段风险寻求的指标提供了一种有效的解决方案，弥补了训练和评估之间的偏差问题。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

Result: GOODIE在特定场景下（少量和大量特征的情况）均优于现有的最优方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE框架在特征缺失情况下展现了强大表现，可广泛应用于数据稀缺及多样性数据场景。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

*Micah Rentschler,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在满足特定条件下，训练仅最大化贪心目标的代理也能够展示出探索行为的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索和利用的平衡一直是元强化学习的关键问题。传统方法往往通过外部激励（例如随机化、不确定性奖励或内在奖励）来解决，而本文探讨是否可以仅通过最大化收益目标就实现探索。

Method: 提出了三个条件：环境的规律性结构（Recurring Environmental Structure）、代理的记忆能力（Agent Memory）以及长时间信用分配（Long-Horizon Credit Assignment）。通过多臂赌博机和网格世界实验，检验是否能实现探索行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，当环境结构和代理记忆条件满足时，代理在仅追求贪心目标的情况下可以表现出探索行为。但移除长时间信用分配并不总是阻止探索，原因可能是伪Thompson采样效应。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，探索和利用可以通过一个统一的奖励最大化过程实现，而不需要将其视为两个独立的目标。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedCD的公平性联邦认知诊断框架，通过参数解耦的个性化策略，在保护数据隐私的同时，实现对不同学习环境中学生的精准和公平诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线智能教育平台生成的大量分布式学习数据的增加，认知诊断在评估学生对知识概念掌握上提供了机会，但也带来了数据隐私和安全的挑战，同时学生群体间能力差异导致的数据质量问题也给模型的公平性运行带来了困扰。

Method: 提出FedCD框架，通过结合新颖的参数解耦个性化策略，将模型参数分为本地个性化参数和全局通用参数。本地参数专注于学生的公平诊断，全局参数通过公平性聚合策略更新以减轻跨学校的不公平性。

Conclusion: FedCD框架能够在保护数据隐私的同时，结合公平性聚合策略实现不同学习环境下学生的精准、个性化和公平的认知诊断。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Motivation: 目前关于物理脆弱性的研究存在静态、昂贵、区域特定等问题，难以动态评估大规模灾害风险。

Method: 提出了一种新的机器学习框架——Graph Variational State-Space Model (GraphVSSM)，将图深度学习、状态空间建模和变分推理结合，处理时序数据并综合专家先验知识。

Result: 在菲律宾奎松市、孟加拉库鲁舒尔社区以及塞拉利昂弗里敦的测试中取得了成功，并发布了一个改进的全球静态数据集METEOR 2.5D。

Conclusion: 该方法在灾害复原能力评估和全球灾害风险降低中具有重要应用价值，同时为城市研究提供了一种新的概率深度学习方法。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Method: 探索了标准PINN与BC-PINN的性能，结合物理约束的放松与损失函数动态加权，以及针对二维和三维不同问题的应用。

Result: PINNs表现出从稀疏数据中学习复杂流体物理的能力，尤其是在涡流湍流领域的突出应用。

Conclusion: 研究证明PINNs能够解决复杂的流场重建问题，为工程实际中的稀疏数据建模提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，传统的K折交叉验证虽然能增强模型鲁棒性，但其高计算需求和频繁的数据打乱可能降低泛化能力评估的效果，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了融合随机抽样（SRS）与K折交叉验证（KFCV）的FSV方法，利用加权因子平衡性能与泛化能力，并通过对三个不同规模数据集进行对比实验验证。

Result: FSV在多个指标如均值估计（ME：0.000863）、方差估计（VE：0.949644）、均方误差（MSE：0.952127）等方面表现优于SRS和KFCV。

Conclusion: FSV能够在资源受限环境中以及大规模数据集上实现更高效的分区，更适用于实际机器学习任务。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

<details>

Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，随着状态和动作分布的变化，深度学习策略的训练往往会导致性能下降或完全崩溃。研究此问题的动机是探讨改进探索算法或回报目标是否有效，或者是否会受限于优化中的难点。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，用于评估深度强化学习算法的优化限制。

Result: 通过对不同环境和RL算法的实验表明，生成的最佳经验比模型学习的性能高出2-3倍，即深度强化学习方法只能利用生成经验的一半。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在生成高质量经验后未能有效利用，优化困难是其主要限制因素，未来改进需要关注这些优化问题。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 随机逼近潜在能量对积分算法的性能具有重要意义，尤其是Coulomb交互中证明了逼近的均匀一致性控制。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

Method: 通过系统构建具有不同特征相关性和模式分离的人工数据集（采用信息论中的汉明距离度量），并用二分搜索算法计算模型存储容量。

Result: 实验表明：随着输入空间分离增加，存储容量呈指数级增长；特征相关性在一定分离度下略微降低容量，该效应在能量函数的多项式阶数增大时更显著。

Conclusion: 该研究联结了DAM的理论与实际应用，同时可能激发更多数据中心化的方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Motivation: 传统多变量时间序列预测模型在面对跨领域统计变化性时表现有限，且缺乏可解释性与物理性指导，因此需要一个结合概念、物理约束和长时间依赖性的创新方法。

Method: 提出了CPformer模型，通过引入自我监督的领域无关概念，并结合一阶物理约束的可微残差，同时保留对长时间上下文的注意力，来优化跨领域时间序列预测性能。

Result: CPformer在六个公开数据集中表现优异，在12个MSE/MAE评价单元中8个表现最佳，并在电力、交通和疾病传播预测中相较最优基线模型显著降低误差。

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced

domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 通过引入历史令牌，研究有效解决了transformers在序列分类任务中的性能瓶颈，证明了其在实际应用中的优势。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet通过消除超参数调试与训练步骤，在保持高效分类表现的同时，展现出卓越的扩展性与实用性，并为未来算法优化提供了研究方向。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨 transformer 训练中冷却阶段机制的作用和影响，为了解和改进训练过程提供理论基础。

Method: 专注于 Warmup-Stable-Decay 学习率调度器的冷却阶段，分析其冷却曲线形状与模型偏差-方差权衡的关系，并通过损失景观可视化验证该角度的解释。

Result: 发现冷却曲线形状影响模型的探索与利用平衡，不同形状在性能上有显著差异；调优 AdamW 的超参数（如提高 β_2 值）也能提升性能；进一步验证了河谷型损失景观的假设。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段的学习率调度对于 transformer 训练具有重要作用，需要将其视作超参数调优的一部分来提升性能。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于指令的时间序列编辑方法 InstructTime，可以通过自然语言指令灵活地调整时间序列属性，突破现有方法在编辑灵活性和控制力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的时间序列编辑方法过于依赖预定义的属性向量，并且编辑强度缺乏灵活控制，难以满足多样化的编辑需求。

Method: 本研究提出了 InstructTime，通过将时间序列和自然语言指令嵌入到一个共享的多模态表示空间，并解码生成编辑后的时间序列。引入了多分辨率编码器以兼顾局部和全局编辑需求。

Result: 实验表明，InstructTime 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，实现了高质量的编辑效果，具备可控的编辑强度，对未见过的指令有良好的泛化能力，并且能够通过少样本学习快速适应新条件。

Conclusion: InstructTime 为时间序列编辑开辟了全新的方向，展示了自然语言指令的潜能，显著提升了编辑的灵活性和可控性，同时在泛化和适应性方面表现优越。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FlashSVD的新方法，通过改进SVD优化语言模型的内存占用问题，实现高效低内存推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SVD的语言模型参数压缩方法，能够减少存储需求但增加推断时激活内存的开销，限制其在真实设备部署中的实用性。

Method: 作者设计了一个端到端的流式推断框架FlashSVD，通过将低秩投影核直接嵌入自注意力和前馈网络中，避免实际生成全尺寸激活缓冲区，采用小块的截断因子在芯片上逐块处理和释放的不间断流程。

Result: 在BERT-Base等标准测试中，FlashSVD减少峰值激活内存多达70.2%，中间瞬时内存减少75%，且在无精度损失的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩语言模型提供了实践路径，在内存受限场景下实现了推断效率提升，克服了现有方法的激活内存开销瓶颈。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度预测模型由于光谱偏差和缺乏频率感知的归纳先验，往往难以捕捉真实世界时间序列中的周期性模式。

Method: 利用快速傅里叶变换（FFT）引导的坐标下降方法提取低频分量，初始化正弦嵌入，并采用两阶段学习策略在训练中保留频率结构。该方法可无缝整合到现有基于Transformer的模型中。

Result: 在真实数据集基准测试中，该方法显著提升了长时间预测的性能，并在合成数据中准确恢复了真实频率，展现出其在捕获潜在周期模式方面的优越性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 将光谱先验注入深度时序模型能够实现更鲁棒且可解释的长期预测，有效解决频率建模的短板。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现，在刚性系统中，控制快速衰减模式的参数的敏感性在训练过程中会逐渐消失，导致优化困难。本研究希望揭示这个现象的普遍性及其原因。

Method: 通过分析刚性数值积分方法的有理稳定函数，研究其与参数敏感性和梯度消失的关系，并提出常见刚性积分方法的显式公式以展示具体机制。最后，从理论上证明可能的最慢消失率。

Result: 表明所有A-stable时间步进方法的稳定函数导数在高刚性下衰减至零，且最慢衰减速率为$O(|z|^{-1})$，阐明了这个现象的数学基础。

Conclusion: A-stable方法在刚性情形下不可避免地抑制参数梯度，这对训练刚性神经ODEs构成了重大障碍。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

Conclusion: 基于样本原型的模型能够支持基于生理时间序列数据的可解释数字表型构建，在原始训练目标之外捕捉具有临床意义的生理特征，并具有较强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

Motivation: 解决存在负代价循环的最短路径问题（ESPP）难题及其整体的NP难性。

Method: 设计一种无监督的图神经网络，通过代理损失函数联合学习节点价值估计和边选择概率，并利用解码算法将学习到的边概率转换为基础路径。

Result: 在规模高达100个节点的图上，所提方法在无监督基线和传统启发式方法上表现更优，并在未见过的图上实现良好的跨规模和跨拓扑泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于概率的无监督图神经网络方法能够有效缓解负代价循环问题，提供高概率的近似最优解，对解决复杂网络的路径优化问题具有较大的潜力。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习在客户端数据高度异质时表现不佳，急需有效方法解决此问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种将人类反馈结合到扩散模型生成流程中的方法，用于改进拓扑优化结构生成的精确性与可制造性。

Motivation: 现有去噪扩散模型在拓扑优化中的应用中，常使用代理预测器强加物理约束，然而这些约束模型往往不能捕获诸如悬浮组件或边界不连续性等设计缺陷，因此需要一种能更可靠生成结构的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种人类反馈驱动的扩散生成框架，通过收集生成结果的二元人类评价训练轻量化奖励模型，然后将这些奖励模型的梯度集成到预训练扩散模型的抽样中，以引导生成过程生成更实际且可制造的结构设计。

Conclusion: 本方法在无需重新训练扩散模型的情况下，成功结合了人类专业知识与自动化生成设计，是一种可信赖的生成设计扩展方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Motivation: 现有的方法使用启发式的加权函数，但缺乏理论依据，因此需要探索出更优化和理论支持的加权方法。

Method: 通过深入分析比分匹配目标函数的异方差性，推导出通用化的一阶和高阶噪声比分匹配目标函数的优化加权公式。

Result: 发现现有的启发式加权函数是优化加权函数的一阶泰勒展开，并且在某些情况下，启发式加权可能比优化函数能更稳定和高效地训练模型。

Conclusion: 启发式加权函数在保持简单性的同时，能在参数梯度方差上战胜优化加权，因此仍然是一个实用的选择。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种创新的多流学习框架，能够有效解决数据流间的异质性和动态变化问题，在实际应用场景中具有广泛的泛化和适应潜力。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Conclusion: 通过EPRLI算法证明了强化学习在提升模型推理能力上的有效性，为研究界提供了可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large

draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series,
DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 series, and Grok 3 series, remain undisclosed, making it

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中因糟糕输入数据或错误动作导致的“垃圾进垃圾出”问题。

Method: 使用两个外部代理，分别实时评估模型决策并反馈（外部代理1），选择性优化反馈以创建高质量数据集用于后续训练（外部代理2）。并通过“文档识别和信息抽取”场景验证方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，引入人类反馈显著提升了模型的决策鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 这种通过人类参与的增强强化学习框架为数据驱动应用中提升模型表现提供了一种可扩展解决方案，尤其是在复杂或模糊环境中。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模、高质量电子健康记录的稀缺性限制了生物医学研究的进展，尤其是在数据需求越来越大的背景下。当前的数据生成方法难以处理多模态数据的复杂性以及数据缺失问题，特别是在传统中医领域。

Method: 提出了TCDiff框架，通过三个级联扩散网络（Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, Target Modality Diffusion）生成电子健康记录。此外，还构建了一个新的中医多模态数据集TCM-SZ1用于测试。

Conclusion: TCDiff能够有效解决电子健康记录生成中的多模态特性及数据缺失问题，具有很好的推广性，为传统中医乃至广泛的电子健康领域数据生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易因为对训练数据的记忆而受到攻击，从而引发隐私泄露问题，因此需要开发机器遗忘（MU）方法，来有选择地遗忘特定数据点，而无需使用原始训练数据。

Method: 作者提出了一种新方法IMU，它只使用需要遗忘的数据集，通过引入影响力引导的梯度上升和动态分配遗忘强度的方法，来增强遗忘效果。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验结果表明，IMU方法在无需保留数据的情境下优于现有方法，表现出更高的遗忘效果和模型效用。

Conclusion: IMU方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，尤其适合无保留数据机器遗忘的应用场景，开辟了机器遗忘领域的新方向。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Motivation: 解决Mixture-of-Experts在GPU内存消耗和有效参数利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出EAC-MoE，其中包含两部分：(1) 通过对路由器校准的量化方法QESC，减轻低位量化引起的专家选择偏差；(2) 基于专家选择频率的裁剪方法PESF，移除任务中不常用的专家以加速推理。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效降低了内存使用，并显著提升推理速度，同时性能损失很小。

Conclusion: EAC-MoE显著优化了GPU资源利用与推断效率，为MoE-LM的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Method: 提出USRFNet，将流量侧特征与资源侧特征分开建模，并结合GNN和gMLP模块的网络结构进行信息融合，预测窗口级P95尾延迟。

Result: 在真实的微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试下显著提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: USRFNet有效解决了微服务架构性能预测中的关键问题，为复杂系统的性能预测提供了更高的精准度和稳定性。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

Conclusion: 提出的异构模型联邦学习框架有效提升客户端泛化性能，验证了特征分布交换与VTC模型的创新性与实用性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决核化多臂赌博问题和广义线性赌博问题的统一建模与优化，特别是针对存在非线性噪声模型的复杂场景。

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，并开发基于Freeedman不等式和拼接论证的全新自归一化的Bernstein类维度无关不等式。

Result: 得到了$O (gamma_T \u007fsqrt{T/kappa_*})$的后悔界限，其匹配了当前最优结果。

Conclusion: 研究为核化和广义线性赌博问题之间提供了统一视角，并在理论分析和算法设计上均有重要贡献。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合令牌化方法，将表格数据转化为适合大型语言模型（LLMs）训练的统一序列格式，并验证了其高效性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时编码数值和类别特征，或保持表格的固有结构；文章希望为训练LLMs提供一种更适合表格数据的表示方法。

Method: 提出混合令牌化方法，利用固定令牌表示结构元素和低基数类别特征，结合BPE学习的子词词汇表示高基数类别和连续值。

Result: 在大规模NetFlow数据集上验证了方法效率，五小时内处理3130万网络流量，数据压缩比达到6.18:1。

Conclusion: 该方法为基础模型在结构化数据上的训练提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

Motivation: 为了解决时间序列分类中原始时间序列难以解读以及输入维度高的问题。

Method: 提出PHAR框架，将数值特征归因通过规则表示出来，并通过权重选择和套索方法优化规则集，实现实例的全面覆盖及简洁化。

Result: 在UCI数据集上的实验表明，PHAR在时间序列分类任务中提升了解释性、决策透明度及实际应用性。

Conclusion: PHAR框架通过改进模型透明性、规则合并策略和可视化技术，为时间序列分类说明提供了实用而直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Method: 在每次迭代中，使用神经网络通过最小化固定策略诱导的线性偏微分方程残差来逼近值函数，同时提供线性结构的系统误差控制和Lipschitz型界限。

Conclusion: 此方法将确定性PINN方法扩展到随机环境，并继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性，结果表明其具有理论保证和有效性。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Motivation: 现有条件生成模型（CcGAN和CCDM）存在数据不平衡和采样效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出了CcGAN-AVAR框架，包括自适应邻域机制和多任务判别器，通过动态调整邻域大小和优化生成器训练。同时简化生成过程以提高采样效率。

Result: 实验表明，CcGAN-AVAR在四个基准数据集和多个不平衡场景中，生成质量达到最优，并显著提高了采样效率（300到2000倍）。

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR成功克服了现有模型的数据不平衡和采样效率问题，为连续条件生成模型提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找一种更加高效且参数负担更低的方法来提升时间序列预测性能，同时避免大型视觉模型带来的过度拟合问题。

Method: 引入了知识蒸馏框架OccamVTS，利用预训练的LVMs作为教师模型，通过金字塔式特征对齐、相关性与特征蒸馏过滤掉语义噪声，仅提取必要的时间序列预测信息到轻量级网络中。

Result: OccamVTS在多个标杆数据集上均表现出先进性能，仅用1%的原始参数特别在少样本和零样本场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过采用极端参数减少和消除非必要特征，OccamVTS在提升预测准确性的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，为时间序列预测任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式大语言模型的快速发展对云端GPU提出了极低延迟的要求，但带来了能源成本的增加，需要新的方法提高能源效率。

Method: 通过在线强化学习，AGFT实时监测请求负载和延迟，精细控制GPU频率，并通过剪枝技术优化决策空间，自动调整GPU频率以达到最佳能效。

Result: AGFT在实测中能节省44.3%的GPU能源消耗，同时将性能延迟控制在10%以内，实现了最高40.3%的能耗延迟产品优化。

Conclusion: AGFT证明了通过智能频率调节可以在提升能源效率的同时维持服务质量，是管理LLM推理任务GPU集群的一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Conclusion: FedDPQ是首个在不可靠无线条件下，从数据、计算和通信多角度联合优化联邦学习性能的框架，为实时CV任务带来显著改进。

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: 经验重放和梯度对齐是有效的持续预训练手段，且元经验重放在计算成本和性能之间取得平衡，未来应更多关注持续预训练的效率及方法优化。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Conclusion: SemGuide是一种适用于任何条件扩散框架的高效方法，通过增强协变量一致性，提升了模型的预测能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Result: 定性分析发现子空间在许多情况下是可解释的，定量实验表明子空间与GPT-2的电路变量强相关，并证实其对更大模型的可扩展性。

Conclusion: NDM方法在神经模型的表示空间中发现了与抽象概念相关的子空间，对理解模型内部机制和构建电路提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Conclusion: 伪线性TO在保持SGD收敛速度的同时降低了方差，以极小的计算开销实现了更高效的优化。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Result: 实验结果表明，VAGPO在TSP和CVRP基准测试中表现出高度竞争力，不仅优化质量高，还能扩展到更大的实例（最多1000个节点），且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: VAGPO在学习效率和可扩展性方面表现出了较强优势，为解决复杂路径问题提供了新方向。

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

Motivation: 强调近似最近邻搜索算法优化在AI应用中的重要性，例如知识检索和大型语言模型中的增强。在此背景下提出CRINN。

Method: 将ANNS优化建模为强化学习问题，将执行速度作为奖励信号，同时坚持准确性约束。

Conclusion: CRINN验证了使用LLM结合强化学习可以自动优化复杂的算法问题，其方法不仅在ANNS优化上有效，也具有更广泛的应用与潜力。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

TL;DR: 本文研究了异步分布式联邦学习（DFL）中客户持久掉线问题，提出了基于客户端重建的自适应策略来缓解此问题，并在多个数据集和算法场景中验证了其有效性和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异步分布式联邦学习中，由于客户掉线和信息不完全导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于客户端重建的自适应策略，在没有完整数据分布和损失函数的情况下，提高掉线客户端的性能恢复能力，并进行多种实验验证。

Result: 该策略在表格数据和图像数据集上实验，结合三种DFL算法和三种数据异质性场景，验证其优化了模型在客户掉线后的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 尽管未完全重建缺失客户端的数据，新方法仍能有效缓解联邦学习的性能损失，同时提出了该方法的局限性及未来改善方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Conclusion: 通过将时序问题转化为最优控制问题，该方法有望提高连续时间方法的鲁棒性与性能。

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: TD2C在未见过的动态数据和广泛的真实基准测试上表现出色，实现了领先的效果，尤其是在高维和非线性场景中。

Conclusion: 论文通过引入TD2C工具，从模式识别角度重新定义了复杂系统中因果结构发现的方法，为此领域提供了一个稳健且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PCPO的新方法，通过预防性策略优化强化安全强化学习，显著提高了其稳定性和约束合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的策略优化方法通常采用拉格朗日方法来处理约束优化问题，但这种事后补救的方式容易导致振荡和超调。因此需要一种能够主动预防的优化方法。

Method: 提出一种名为Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) 的新方法，通过在目标函数中引入屏障项形成预防性惩罚机制，并在靠近约束边界时激活约束感知内在奖励，以实现边界感知的探索。通过理论分析提供了PCPO更新的对偶间隙和性能的上下界，并采用策略迭代的方式提升优化性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，PCPO框架在政策优化的约束性和稳定性方面表现出显著的优势，并提供了未来研究和实践应用的重要启示。

Conclusion: PCPO提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案，在约束条件下实现了显著稳定的策略优化，拓宽了安全强化学习的应用前景。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法对完整响应的处理过于粗粒度，导致奖励分配不准确，进而影响模型学习效率和准确性。

Method: 引入CAPO方法，采用通用LLM生成逐步批判性评价，通过投票机制提高准确性，并提供更细粒度的奖励信号。

Result: 实验证明，CAPO在六个数学基准和三个领域外基准上均优于现有的监督学习和强化学习微调方法。

Conclusion: CAPO方法有效改进了奖励信号分配的精度，加强了推理过程中对有效步骤的识别，具有显著的性能提升作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Method: 通过提出一个名为"干预检测器"(ID)的统一框架，分析隐藏状态和表示来揭示线性引导能力演化，并使用热图、熵趋势及余弦相似度等指标评估这种变化。同时测试不同模型以验证普适性。

Result: 研究表明线性引导能力在训练中期逐步显现，不同概念的可引导性出现阶段也不同。随着训练的进行，概念在隐藏空间中变得更加线性可分，引导能力的出现与此密切相关。

Conclusion: 通过一致性框架与新的评估指标，成功明确了模型训练中的线性引导能力演化，为优化语言模型控制性提供了见解。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

Conclusion: 基于LLM和RL的结合方法相比传统强化学习方法，在战略性决策及交易绩效表现上更具优势。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有最优基线快达三数量级。

Conclusion: DBMM和DB-RPNI显著改进部分可观察环境中的强化学习，提升效率和性能。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过梯度为基础的元学习来增强神经网络在少样本情况下学习离散概念的能力，并提供了对特征复杂性和组合复杂性如何影响学习的深入分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用元学习方法提升神经网络在少样本情况下高效获取离散概念的能力，尤其在概念具有多维性和递归组合性的情况下。

Method: 通过构建基于概率上下文无关文法(PCFG)生成的布尔任务，比较元学习与传统监督学习在不同概念维度和组合复杂性下的表现，并分析优化曲面对于复杂性的影响。

Result: 在组合复杂性较高的情况下，元学习显著优于监督学习，效果受益于优化策略的改进（如二阶方法和扩展梯度适应），且元学习对概念空间优化损失的粗糙性具备更高的适应能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了元学习在处理高维和复杂概念空间中的表现优势，并明确了元学习在组合复杂性处理中的适应能力，提供了关于二阶优化方法在少样本学习中的作用的见解。

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning

strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

Motivation: 为解决电网离散拓扑优化中传统混合整数规划方法的计算复杂度问题，引入机器学习技术。

Method: 利用线图神经网络（LGNN）估算直流电力流，以及异构图神经网络（HeteroGNN）预测断路器状态，并通过物理一致性损失连接两者以满足物理约束。

Result: 在多达1000个断路器的网络中，实验表明与基线相比，电力出口提升高达18%，推理时间缩短至毫秒级。

Conclusion: OptiGridML展示了结构化和流感知神经网络在物理网络系统组合优化加速中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于强化学习或贪婪互信息最大化，但分别存在训练困难及短视问题。

Method: 提出一种基于潜变量模型的监督学习方法，在随机潜在空间中对多种可能特征进行推理实现动态特征获取。

Result: 在多种合成和真实数据集上的实验表明该方法显著优于众多基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态特征获取任务中表现优越，有助于解决强化学习和贪婪算法的固有挑战。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Kron-LoRA的新型适配器，用于参数高效且具有高表达力的大规模预训练语言模型微调，该方法在减少参数的同时能保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建一种能够同时实现参数效率和高表达能力的适配器，以应对大规模预训练语言模型在多任务中的适配需求。

Method: 通过Kronecker分解和LoRA的低秩分解，将每个冷冻线性更新分解为低维Kronecker结构，同时进一步使用低秩分解压缩调整矩阵，并利用量化技术进一步降低存储需求。

Result: Kron-LoRA在多项任务中取得了与LoRA相近的性能，同时使用了大约四分之一的适配器参数量，并在传输性能和多任务适应性上表现更优。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA结合了Kronecker结构、低秩压缩和量化的优势，为大规模多任务适配提供了参数高效、可扩展且支持可持续学习的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

*Seyyed Saeid Cheshmi,Azal Ahmad Khan,Xinran Wang,Zirui Liu,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨使用过程奖励模型(PRMs)在生成过程中提供早期信号的方法以降低推理计算开销，同时保证推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当下的大型语言模型(LLMs)在解决数学、逻辑等复杂推理任务时依赖于计算扩展。然而，现有方法如PRMs导致推理并行生成时计算成本过高。本文希望通过提前识别和拒绝次优候选以降低这一开销。

Method: 提出了一个假设：PRMs也可以作为部分奖励模型，部分完成推理步骤的分数可以用来预测最终输出质量。在此基础上开发了一种基于中间标记信号的早期拒绝方法，并通过理论和实验证实了假设的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，在数学推理基准测试中，该方法在不降低最终性能的前提下，实现了推理浮点操作数(FLOPs)最大约9倍的减少。

Conclusion: 使用PRMs进行早期拒绝可以显著提高LLMs推理的计算效率，是一种有效的优化机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 推动通过EHR数据进行准确临床结果预测，从而改善患者护理、优化资源分配及早期干预。

Method: 提出一种两阶段架构，第一阶段利用LLM处理未结构化数据并结合图知识检索外部医疗知识，第二阶段结合结构化和非结构化数据进行预测。

Result: 框架在预测30天内再入院率和院内死亡率的任务中表现出色，AUC分别达0.84和0.92，同时超过传统基准和现有的临床实践。

Conclusion: 结合LLM图引导知识检索与结构化数据的框架在医疗预测中证明了其有效性，尤其是面对数据严重不平衡时仍然表现强劲。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了KAFNet模型，结合CPA，通过一系列模块解决IMTS预测中不均匀采样和多变量异步性问题，取得了优异的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的IMTS处理方法存在预对齐长序列计算开销较大及图模型难以捕获全局关系的问题，研究目的在于保留CPA的同时优化模型对预对齐序列的处理能力。

Method: KAFNet由预卷积模块（平滑序列及缓解稀疏性）、时间内核聚合模块（学习压缩及建模序列不规则性）以及频率线性注意块（在频域建模低成本全局相关性）组成。

Result: 实验证明KAFNet在多个IMTS数据集上取得了最先进的预测性能，并将参数减少了7.2倍，训练和推理速度提高了8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet证明了结合CPA策略，可在IMTS预测中有效提升性能和效率，优于现有的图基准模型。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and

Conclusion: Dual-DM显著改善了利用演化场景生成方法创建安全至关重要场景的性能，能够有效提高自动驾驶测试的效率和质量。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph
structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph
influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces
challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net框架为未来流行病控制提供了有希望的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 为了应对因LoRA微调带来的对齐漂移，保障模型的安全性及行为一致性。

Method: 该方法结合主任务损失作为监督信号，引入基于费舍尔信息矩阵的正则化方式以及任务特定的正则化策略。此外，还包含碰撞感知正则化技术，通过Riemannian overlap和geodesic separation进行参数更新的优化。

Result: AGL框架在典型基准测试中减少对齐漂移达50%，且保证了下游任务的性能不受损失。

Conclusion: AGL作为LoRA的结构优化，可有效减少对齐漂移，以极小的性能妥协实现安全性提升并保持适应动态。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法为设计自适应环境难度的CTRL算法提供了新方向，并提升算法的学习效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了减少施工区域内大卡车并线时冲突的策略，提出了一种基于LSTM神经网络的风险预测方法并与其他方法对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大卡车体积大、盲点多，在施工区域内并线时容易发生安全问题，因此需要一种有效的风险评估和决策策略来降低冲突风险。

Method: 使用LSTM神经网络预测大卡车并线过程中的冲突风险，评估所需的安全间隙，并据此设计安全的并线决策策略。同时与基线方法（概率风险、50百分位和85百分位间隙策略）进行了对比分析。

Result: 基于LSTM的方法展示出更低的冲突风险，相较基线方法降低了Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET)和Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT)的值。同时，大卡车能够在保持移动状态下顺利提前并线，而非如传统方法中需要完全停下来等待。

Conclusion: 该研究表明基于LSTM的冲突预测方法可以有效减少施工区域大卡车并线时的冲突风险，并优化并线行为，提升交通安全性。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Motivation: 当前基于混淆矩阵的多分类任务中，注释者的能力评估在数据稀疏或类别不平衡时表现不稳定，且单一混淆矩阵无法全面捕捉注释者的能力模式。

Method: 提出一种称为PTBCC的新方法，通过原型学习假设存在原型混淆矩阵集合，用Dirichlet分布扩展每个注释者的能力表征，以更可靠地刻画注释者的能力模式。

Result: 实验表明，PTBCC在11个真实数据集上的准确率最高提升15%，平均提升3%，计算成本减少超过90%。

Conclusion: PTBCC方法有效克服了数据稀疏性和类不平衡导致的问题，能够以更低的计算成本实现更高效的多分类注释任务。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Conclusion: 结构设计不仅是性能调整的一部分，更是影响深度网络学习动态的关键因素。本文提出的原则为设计可解释及可信赖的学习系统提供了方向。

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Conclusion: 该研究开启激活稀疏性的新方向，为下一代人工智能系统的算法和架构设计提供了重要的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对联邦学习中目标数据投毒的防御方法，即线性代数检测（FedLAD），通过将聚合过程建模为线性问题进行优化，实验证明了其在不同恶意节点比例下的鲁棒性和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习面临Sybil攻击的威胁，尤其是恶意节点的目标数据投毒攻击，这可能导致整个系统崩溃，亟需有效防御策略。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性代数优化问题，通过识别独立线性组合来排除恶意元素。与现有的聚类或稳健训练相比，该方法尤其适用于恶意节点占多数的情况。

Result: 实验表明，FedLAD在多种任务和应用设置下均表现出优越的防御能力，在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时攻击成功率低，比例为0.2至0.5时能保持高模型准确率。

Conclusion: FedLAD显著增强了联邦学习系统面对数据投毒攻击的可靠性和性能，呈现出广泛的适用性和潜力。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: AuroBind提供了一种普适性框架，连接结构预测和治疗发现间的差距，显著提高分子筛选效率和精度。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement

safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MLP、MSCNN和交叉注意力（CA）的轨迹预测模型，以提升预测精度并兼顾推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 如何在可接受的推理时间内降低用户轨迹预测的误差是当前研究中的一个重要问题，尤其是解决包含全局和局部时间信息的复杂轨迹数据的挑战。

Method: 利用MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息，并通过不同尺寸的卷积核捕获多分辨率的时间信息。最终通过交叉注意力融合全局和局部的时间信息。

Result: 实验表明，与ModernTCN对比，所提模型在12步预测中将均方误差减少5.04%、平均绝对误差减少4.35%，并保持类似的推理时间。

Conclusion: 通过结合多层感知机、卷积神经网络和交叉注意力机制，有效改善了轨迹预测的性能，为处理包含复杂时间信息的轨迹数据提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的上下文感知自适应解码方法，通过利用紧凑的参考锚定空间，在生成过程中进行检索式logit调整，从而提高大语言模型在开放式问答任务中的真实度，无需模型重新训练。


<details>

Conclusion: 提出的方法是模型无关的、可扩展的且高效，仅需单次生成步骤，展示了上下文感知解码在大语言模型生成内容真实化中的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Conclusion: MPFT框架在保持高效性的同时改进了多目标强化学习帕累托前的逼近性能，是一种优于传统模型的新方法。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种名为Pigeon-SL的新方法，通过基于鸽巢原理的群体筛选解决拆分学习（SL）中因恶意客户端导致的模型退化问题，同时增强训练与通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管拆分学习（SL）在隐私保护和通信效率方面表现优异，但其逐次更新的流程容易受恶意客户端影响，从而导致模型性能下降。这一问题需要有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Pigeon-SL方法，基于鸽巢原理，将所有客户端分成多个集群，每个集群独立使用SL进行训练，并基于验证集损失选择最优集群进行更新，从而隔离和舍弃恶意更新；此外，提出Pigeon-SL+，通过重复训练提高与标准SL相同的更新吞吐量。

Result: 在标签翻转、激活和梯度操纵攻击等三种攻击模型下，所提方法的准确率和鲁棒性显著优于基线SL方法，实现了更优效果。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL及其改进版Pigeon-SL+有效缓解了恶意客户端对分布式学习性能的威胁，并在未来智能无线网络中展示了较大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Motivation: 现有最短路径搜索方法在面对复杂和大规模图时效率较低或限制较多，亟需一种准确且通用的方法。

Result: 在五个不同的真实图数据集上测试，证明框架在不同图类型中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架为学习型最短路径搜索提供了灵活高效的解决方案，适用于广泛的图类型。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Conclusion: NMS是首个无DNN、近存储采样技术，有效缓解了泛化问题并减少数据访问的DDR能耗。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的基于混沌动态系统及压缩的分类方法，为分类问题提供了一种崭新的理论视角，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

*Joon-Hyun Park,Mujin Cheon,Dong-Yeun Koh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BOOST框架，该框架能自动选择贝叶斯优化中的最佳核函数和采集函数组合，提高优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化的性能受到核函数和采集函数等超参数选择的影响，不适当的组合可能导致性能下降。现有做法通常需要手动选择，效率低下。

Method: 提出BOOST框架，通过离线阶段预测不同核函数和采集函数组合的性能，选出最佳配置。具体方法包括将数据划分为参考集和查询集，然后在内部运行评估每个组合的表现。

Result: BOOST在合成基准函数和实际超参数优化任务中均表现优异，相较于固定超参数的标准贝叶斯优化方法具有更高的性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BOOST框架有效地解决了贝叶斯优化核函数和采集函数自动选择的问题，适用于多种场景，显著提升了优化效率和性能。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Polya-Gamma增强的可扩展Gibbs采样器，并与其他方法对比分析了词嵌入的贝叶斯不确定性量化问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法计算复杂度高或依赖限制性假设，无法有效处理大规模文本数据的不确定性量化问题。

Method: 使用Polya-Gamma增强的Gibbs采样器以及Laplace近似，同时与MFVI和HMC方法进行比较。

Result: Gibbs采样器和HMC能够正确估计不确定性，而MFVI不能，Laplace近似需较大的样本量才表现良好。此外，Gibbs采样器能处理大型真实数据集，并提升词嵌入后验均值在小样本上的表现。

Conclusion: 后验抽样对提升词嵌入质量十分关键，提出的方法在文本数据不确定性量化方面更具优势。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

*Wenyuan Liu,Haoqian Meng,Yilun Luo,Peng Zhang,Xindian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroMix是一种基于Microscaling数据格式的混合精度量化算法和矩阵乘法核，适用于NVIDIA Blackwell架构，通过改进INT4内核不足实现至少20%的计算效率提升。同时在多种下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INT4内核未能充分利用NVIDIA Blackwell架构中的FP4 Tensor Core性能，本文旨在通过新的算法和内核设计提升大语言模型的推理效率。

Method: 提出了MicroMix算法与内核，支持MXFP4、MXFP6和MXFP8的任意组合，并输出BFloat16，同时引入量化阈值机制优化线性层中低精度格式的分配，以在精度与效率中取得平衡。

Result: MicroMix在零样本、少样本学习、语言建模等任务中性能优异，在消费级与服务器级GPU上执行速度超过TensorRT-FP8至少20%。

Conclusion: MicroMix显著提升了大语言模型的推理效率和存储效率，是INT4量化内核的重要改进，验证其在多种模型与任务中的实用性并开源代码。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lwy2020/MicroMix.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) 和 Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) 距离的新切片技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现在的切片GW方法仅适用于欧几里得几何，且对等距变换不变性丧失，限制了应用范围。此研究旨在开发一种能克服这些缺陷的新切片方法。

Method: 提出基于一个合理的下界、层级最佳传输（hierarchical OT）及适用于底层1D OT的正交规则的新切片技术，用以改进GW和FGW计算。

Result: 新方法相比传统的GW和FGW显著降低了计算复杂性并提升了数值稳定性，同时保留对等距变换的不变性，支持对任意几何结构的比较。

Conclusion: 这一新距离定义了一个伪度量，用于结构空间的比较，并在形状检索和图同构测试中展示了其更加鲁棒和可靠的特点。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

TL;DR: PPF是一种新的剪枝框架，通过秒级性能预测而无需人工设置，同时支持动态和静态的剪枝策略，显著提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非均匀剪枝方法依赖人工设计的剪枝策略，难以适应动态的剪枝需求且评估过程耗时。

Method: 提出了PPF框架，利用智能代理决策和轻量性能预测器实现秒级剪枝策略评估，同时支持动态和静态剪枝。

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Llama3-8B上，PPF分别在动态和静态剪枝中使困惑度降低最高达33.4%和84.78%，评估速度从分钟级提升到秒级。

Conclusion: PPF通过移除手动依赖和大幅优化评估效率，为LLM剪枝提供了一种高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图谱嵌入方法在捕获替代变换域的潜在结构特征方面表现有限，需要提高嵌入空间的表达能力。

Method: 将图分数傅里叶变换应用到现有的GEFFE方法中，引入了新的GEFRFE方法，同时通过搜索优化和ResNet18自适应学习动态确定分数阶。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验中，GEFRFE方法捕获到了更丰富的结构特征，并显著提升了分类性能，同时保持了与GEFFE相当的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: GEFRFE方法利用分数域拓展了图谱嵌入，提升了嵌入的信息量和分类性能，是对图谱嵌入方法的一种优化提升。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为$\epsilon$-softmax的新方法，用于缓解标签噪声问题，通过在softmax层输出中引入可控误差$\epsilon$，有效平衡了噪声鲁棒性与学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗标签噪声的方法多集中于对称性损失函数，但它们经常因条件过于严格导致欠拟合问题。本文旨在通过削弱对称性条件，提出一个更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 提出了$\epsilon$-softmax方法，通过调整softmax层的输出来近似单热向量，同时修改损失函数以增强噪声鲁棒性，理论上证明了其在几乎所有损失函数下具有可控的过度风险边界。

Result: 通过在合成和真实标签噪声数据上的大量实验，验证了该方法的优越性，并展示在不同数据集上的鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: $\epsilon$-softmax能够在保留学习能力的同时显著提高对标签噪声的容忍能力，是一种有效且简单的解决方案。

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习防御机制通常需要非现实的条件，如需先了解异常更新的客户端数量，难以满足实际应用，因此提出无需额外参数且具备动态排除异常客户端功能的ASMR。

Method: 引入了ASMR方法，基于客户端的角距离动态排除异常客户端，无需超参数或预先了解故障客户端的数量。

Result: 实验表明，ASMR能在病理图像分类任务中有效检测到异常客户端，同时还发现动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR方法在无需预设参数的情况下展示出有效检测并处理异常客户端的能力，为联邦学习现实应用中的鲁棒性提供了支持。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的评估模型可作为3D器官形状生成领域内任务相关且轻量化的质量评估工具，支持更透明、与临床需求对齐的评估过程。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Conclusion: 将专家不确定性纳入医学图像分析可以有效缓解标签噪声问题，并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Method: 采用互学习的方式，分别在near-RT-RIC和non-RT-RIC之间独立训练模型，同时通过零阶技术整合模型，并解决资源成本与实时性问题的联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，SplitMe在成本和收敛速度方面明显优于传统框架如SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed。

Conclusion: SplitMe在满足O-RAN实时需求的同时，显著降低了资源消耗，为联邦学习在通信密集型环境中的应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对传统PINNs在处理不规则边界时的稳定性和收敛性问题，引入了一种名为JacobiNet的坐标变换方法，显著提升了解决偏微分方程的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在处理不规则边界时存在归一化不一致、边界条件处理不准确和损失项不平衡等问题，限制了应用范围。

Method: 提出了一种基于轻量级MLP的神经网络坐标变换方法JacobiNet，通过监督点对学习连续可微的映射，直接利用autograd进行Jacobian计算，无需显式网格生成和手动计算Jacobian，能够与PINNs无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明，相较于传统方法，JacobiNet将相对L2误差从0.287-0.637显著降低到0.013-0.039，提高平均精度18.3倍；在类似血管域的实验中，实现了3.65倍的预测精度提升和超过10倍的计算速度提升。

Conclusion: JacobiNet显著提升了PINNs在解决复杂域PDE问题上的泛化性、准确性和效率，对于不规则几何形状的PDE求解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过一个新的验证框架，对~45,000个脑部结构MRI图像进行XAI方法的首次大规模系统性比较，发现目前流行的GradCAM和LRP方法在神经影像学中存在显著缺陷，而SmoothGrad表现出较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估XAI方法在神经影像学上的可靠性和准确性，避免对深度学习模型解释的误用而可能导致的不信任和错误解读。

Method: 提出一种新的验证框架，通过构建具有已知信号来源的预测任务，系统比较了常用XAI方法在~45,000个脑部结构MRI图像上的表现，并分析了这些方法的设计原则与实际神经影像数据特征的适配性。

Result: GradCAM未能准确定位预测特征，LRP产生了大量人为的伪解释，而SmoothGrad显示了一致的准确性和鲁棒性。结果表明，设计原理与自然影像数据匹配的XAI方法在神经影像领域需要大幅调整。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在神经影像学中，XAI方法需要进行特定领域的适配和验证；此前基于传统XAI方法的神经影像研究需要重新评估；为XAI在神经影像中的实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种运用基于规则的系统作为动态特征选择(DFS)的基础分类器的方法，提升了决策的可解释性，同时提供了不确定性的定量衡量并优化了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的特征选择在所有样本中选择统一的特征集，无法定制化每个样本的需求。为了解决这些问题并提高决策透明性，尤其是在临床决策中，研究需要开发一种新的方法。

Method: 提出一种基于规则的系统用于动态特征选择，通过限制特征搜索空间来优化计算效率，并使选择特征最小化与总体模型预测的差异，增强决策的可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有的贪心方法和强化学习 (RL) 方法相比，所提出的基于规则的动态特征选择方法在决策透明性和性能上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了动态特征选择的可解释性，同时在效率和性能方面具有显著优势，适用于需要透明决策的场景，例如临床决策。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

TL;DR: 现有几何图神经网络（GNNs）难以处理图中的多样性几何结构，而ARGNN通过学习连续各向异性黎曼度量张量场解决了这一问题，展示了其在多种数据集中的优秀性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何图神经网络无法有效处理图中具备不同局部曲率的复杂几何异质性结构，需要一种能够自适应图几何景观的新方法。

Method: 提出一种自适应黎曼图神经网络（ARGNN），通过为每个节点学习一个连续的各向异性黎曼度量张量场，允许节点决定其最优局部几何，并采用基于Ricci流的正则化确保几何平滑性和训练稳定性。

Result: 在同质性和异质性数据集上均表现出优异性能，证明其能够自适应捕捉复杂多样的图结构，同时所学几何结构提供了可解释性和理论验证。

Conclusion: ARGNN提供了一种统一的连续方法，克服了现有固定或混合曲率GNN的局限性，既提升了性能又提高了模型的解释性和理论支撑。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 解决生成模型在低数据情境下生成低保真表格数据的问题，同时改善隐私保护与统计保真之间的平衡。

Method: 提出了StructSynth框架，采用两阶段方法，先通过结构发现学习有向无环图(DAG)，再以此为蓝图指导LLM生成符合结构依赖的高保真数据。

Result: 实验表明，StructSynth在数据结构完整性和实用性上显著超越现有方法，尤其在低数据量场景表现优异。

Conclusion: StructSynth是一种在隐私保护和统计保真之间实现平衡的有效方法，可为低数据场景生成高质量的表格数据。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DeepKoopFormer，将Transformer与Koopman算子理论结合，构建一个适用于高维动态系统的可解释且稳定的时间序列预测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在长程预测中可解释性不足以及面对噪声或动态不确定性时的稳定性问题。

Method: 采用模块化结构(编码器-传播器-解码器)，在潜在空间中通过拥有结构约束的线性Koopman算子来学习时间动态，确保稳定性和可解释性。

Result: 在合成动态系统、气候、金融时间序列及电力数据集上表现优于LSTM和基础Transformer模型，具有更高精度、更强抗噪声能力及长期预测稳定性。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一种灵活、可解释且鲁棒的高维动态预测框架，在众多实验中均展示出出色性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Motivation: 探讨如何通过极少的数据和简单的模型实现音频效果的产生，同时保持信号的控制和变化特性。

Method: 使用两种核心技术：条件感知卷积核（CAK），引入控制门机制实现输出的可塑性；以及自我审计生成对抗网络（AuGAN），通过对控制应用的验证重新定义对抗训练。

Result: 发现了具有对频率敏感的时间平移特性卷积核，该核可以基于输入特性产生音乐效果。

Conclusion: 证明了对抗训练在音频变换发现上的潜力，为设计新型效果器提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Conclusion: LOST展示了在资源受限下预训练大语言模型的有效性及其潜力，为优化大型语言模型的资源使用提供了新方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Abstract: Criticality is a behavioral state in dynamical systems that is known to
present the highest computation capabilities, i.e., information transmission,
storage, and modification. Therefore, such systems are ideal candidates as a
substrate for reservoir computing, a subfield in artificial intelligence. Our
choice of a substrate is a cellular automaton (CA) governed by an artificial
neural network, also known as neural cellular automaton (NCA). We apply
evolution strategy to optimize the NCA to achieve criticality, demonstrated by
power law distributions in structures called avalanches. With an evolved
critical NCA, the substrate is tested for reservoir computing. Our evaluation
of the substrate is performed with two benchmarks, 5-bit memory task and image
classification of handwritten digits. The result of the 5-bit memory task
achieved a perfect score and the system managed to remember all 5 bits. The
result for the image classification task matched and sometimes surpassed the
performance of the best elementary CA for this task. Moreover, the proposed
critical NCA may operate as a self-organized critical system, due to its
robustness to extreme initial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模异质数据集（如BraTS 2021）时的分割准确性和实用性有限，并且依赖于分割目标的标注数据。

Method: 该方法结合残差引导的去噪扩散模型（DDPM）在第一阶段进行跨模态合成，通过真实和预测的T1ce图像间差异生成残差图，随后在第二阶段利用轻量的U-Net以及多模态输入数据改进整体肿瘤分割。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升分割精度和实用性的同时，展现了其对真实世界中的多中心MRI数据集的可扩展性与稳定性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at
