### [1] [A Lightweight Convolution and Vision Transformer integrated model with Multi-scale Self-attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16884)
*Yi Zhang,Lingxiao Wei,Bowei Zhang,Ziwei Liu,Kai Yi,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEViT 是一种结合卷积模块的轻量级 Vision Transformer，采用稀疏注意力机制和分层金字塔结构，有效提升计算效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Vision Transformer 存在模型大、计算成本高及局部特征提取能力差的问题，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 引入稀疏聚合注意力模块（SAA）和通道交互前馈网络（CIFFN）以减少计算复杂度和提高特征信息交流，结合深度可分离卷积构造分层金字塔结构。

Result: 在 ImageNet-1K 数据集上进行分类任务，实现了76.3%和79.6%的 Top-1 准确率，分别使用了0.8 GFLOPs 和 1.3 GFLOPs。

Conclusion: SAEViT 在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算开销，提供了一种适用于基本视觉任务的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

### [2] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种创新的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过重新投影深度图和双编码器网络融合来解决iToF深度传感器的分辨率低、视角受限和结构扭曲问题，并显著提高深度精度和视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于iToF深度传感器在空间分辨率、视野范围、以及复杂场景中的结构失真等局限性，提出一种新的方法来弥补这些短板。

Method: 方法包括通过几何校准模块将窄视角的iToF深度图重新投影至宽视角的RGB坐标系，依靠双编码器融合网络提取iToF深度图与RGB图像的互补特征，并利用单目深度先验指导深度超分辨率，同时融入跨模态的结构提示与深度一致性约束。

Result: 所提框架能显著提升深度精度、边缘清晰度及视场扩展能力，在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明优于最新技术。

Conclusion: 本文提出的iToF-RGB融合框架有效解决了iToF深度传感器的局限性，在多方面性能上均取得了显著提升，展示了较高的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

### [3] [CountLoop: Training-Free High-Instance Image Generation via Iterative Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16644)
*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练的框架CountLoop，通过迭代的结构化反馈实现扩散模型中精确实例控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在高密度复杂场景中难以生成具备精确数量物体的图像，CountLoop旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过交替图像生成与多模态评估，利用语言引导的规划师和批评器对物体计数、空间布局和一致性进行评估，并进一步引入实例驱动的注意力掩蔽和组合生成技术。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench以及两个新提出的基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确率，并优于布局或梯度引导的基准线，得分达到0.97。

Conclusion: CountLoop提高了扩散模型在高密度场景中的计数准确性和生成质量，展示出此无训练框架的强效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [4] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探索VLMs在组合推理、对象绑定上的问题成因，通过CLIP的视觉编码器的MLP层神经元超叠加现象发现其受限具体表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升VLMs在处理新颖对象及属性组合上的能力表现，以及解决其组合推理和对象绑定能力不足的问题。

Method: 通过机械解释性技术分析CLIP模型中MLP层神经元特性，探索其对组合特性表征的影响。

Result: 发现MLP层神经元表现出多特征表征(超叠加)现象，这直接影响了VLMs的组合推理和对象绑定能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了组合失败的成因与机制，为后续探索VLMs的系统性改进提供线索。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [5] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架MSNav，用于解决视觉语言导航(VLN)中现有模型的空间推理、跨模态匹配和长任务记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VLN模型在空间推理、跨模态匹配和长任务记忆上存在显著缺陷，限制了模型的导航能力。

Method: 提出了MSNav框架，融合记忆模块(动态地图记忆与节点裁剪)、空间模块(空间推理和对象关系识别)和决策模块(基于LLM的路径规划)，并引入并微调Qwen-Spatial模型。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上，MSNav在成功率(SR)和路径长度加权成功率(SPL)上实现了显著改进，超过了现有模型表现。

Conclusion: MSNav以模块化设计有效应对了VLN中的关键问题，成果表明其在复杂导航任务中具备良好性能，尤其在长任务和空间推理上表现卓越。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [7] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为QA-VLM的框架，使用视-语言模型的注意机制和推理能力，开展增材制造质量评估，并优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的质量评估需要高技能操作员参与，且现有的机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，整合视-语言模型的能力与从学术文章中提取的特定领域知识，用于生成人类可解释的质量评估。

Result: 针对24个由激光焊接制备的单线样本验证，QA-VLM的解释质量在有效性和一致性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QA-VLM框架有助于可靠且可解释的增材制造质量评估，展示了其实用化潜力。

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [8] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 介绍了一种名为The Loupe的新型轻量化注意力模块，可插入现有模型，显著提升Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) 的性能，并增强模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前FGVC任务面临精准识别细微特征的挑战，尽管Vision Transformer取得了卓越性能，但其缺乏可解释性，影响了在关键领域如医学诊断或生物多样性监测中的信任度。

Method: 提出The Loupe模块，通过与预训练的如Swin Transformer这种主干网络结合，采用端到端训练，并使用复合损失函数引导模型关注显著的目标区域，无需显式的部件级标注。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上的实验表明，The Loupe将Swin-Base模型的准确率从85.40%提高到88.06%，提升了2.66%。

Conclusion: The Loupe模块不仅提高了FGVC任务的性能，还通过生成清晰的注意力可视化图，提升了模型决策过程的可解释性，使其更值得信赖。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [9] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个卷积神经网络模型，通过读取患者肺部CT扫描来判断COVID-19的严重程度，提高诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于COVID-19造成了广泛的健康危机，患者的呼吸衰竭成为主要死亡原因。研究旨在提高对COVID-19患者病情严重性的预判，以帮助医生应对这种全球性挑战。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络模型（Convolutional Neural Network，CNN），基于患者的新冠病毒检测呈阳性状态下的肺部CT扫描数据进行训练和分析，预测感染结果的严重性。

Result: 模型能够在患者检测出新冠肺炎阳性后的一个月内，根据CT扫描数据预测感染的严重程度。

Conclusion: 这种基于机器学习的诊断工具可以减少人工错误，并通过持续训练不断提升诊断准确性，为疫情防控和医疗资源分配提供重要支持。

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为MedRepBench的基准，用于评估医学报告的结构化理解能力，同时提出了改进VLM的方法并探讨了OCR和LLM的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化基准来评估医学报告的结构化解释质量，而现有的VLMs和LLMs在医学场景中的表现仍需探索和优化。

Method: 提出了MedRepBench基准，基于真实世界的1900份中文医学报告，设计了两种评估协议，并使用GRPO方法优化中型VLM，比较了VLM和OCR+LLM的性能。

Result: 优化后的中型VLM在召回率上提升了6%，证明了改进方法的有效性，同时发现OCR+LLM方案存在布局盲点和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医学报告理解提供了新的评估框架，改进VLM方法具有显著潜力，但完全基于视觉的报告理解仍需进一步发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量、高效的双阶段框架，用于无人机平台上的实时火灾监控与火源检测，实现了计算成本的显著降低和精度的提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无人机计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型，因此需要开发高效轻量的方法来满足实时火灾监测需求。

Method: 提出了两阶段框架：第一阶段通过策略网络和帧压缩技术减少视频数据冗余；第二阶段利用改进的YOLOv8模型进行火源定位。

Result: 第一阶段显著减少了计算成本并保持分类精度；第二阶段在与基准方法相似的推理时间内实现了更高的检测精度。

Conclusion: 所提方法适用于无人机平台，既保证了计算效率又提升了火源检测精度，展示了其在灾害应急响应中的潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 約70%的侵犯性肺腺癌患者在五年內復發。目前的工具無法準確識別需要輔助治療的患者。研究提出了新的深度學習框架CellEcoNet，用以解析組織切片影像並預測復發風險。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有模型難以準確預測侵犯性肺腺癌患者的復發風險，缺乏有效的手段來指引輔助治療策略。研究旨在開發能更好捕捉腫瘤微環境特徵的模型。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，將病理學視為一種語言，利用細胞組成“詞”，細胞鄰域成“短語”，組織結構成“句子”，通過空間性深度學習建模組織切片影像。

Result: 在456張H&E染色切片數據上，CellEcoNet的表現超越了IASLC分級系統（AUC 77.8% vs 71.4%）和現有計算方法（AUC範圍62.2%-67.4%）。系統在不同人群中展現了公平性和一致性。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不僅在預測腫瘤復發方面顯示出優越性能，還揭示了微觀腫瘤環境中的細胞變化與復發風險之間的關聯，為病理學研究帶來新的視角。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

### [13] [A Framework for Benchmarking Fairness-Utility Trade-offs in Text-to-Image Models via Pareto Frontiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16752)
*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于帕累托最优前沿的方法，用于评价文本到图像生成模型在公平性与实用性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现行的公平性评估方法通常依赖主观的定性判断，难以在公平性和适用性方面进行全面评估。

Method: 通过绘制帕累托最优前沿，比较模型在不同超参数配置下的公平性和实用性表现，并采用Normalized Shannon Entropy和ClipScore分别衡量公平性与实用性。

Result: 评价了Stable Diffusion, Fair Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi和FLUX模型，发现多数默认超参数配置在公平性-实用性空间是次优的，并导出了更优的参数配置。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可量化、可复现的框架，推动文本到图像生成模型在公平性与实用性上的改进。

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服诊断成像模型在患者群体多样性中的鲁棒性和公平性挑战，需开发合成数据生成技术以弥补数据规模和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出了RoentGen-v2，能根据影像特征和患者人口学属性生成合成图像，并建立超过56万张平衡人口学的合成数据集。随后利用改进的训练策略对疾病分类模型进行预训练和微调。

Result: 通过对来自五个机构的13.7万张胸部X光数据进行测试，结果显示合成数据预训练提高了下游分类模型的准确度（增加6.5%），同时减少了19.3%的诊断不公平性差距。

Conclusion: RoentGen-v2证明了合成影像在提升医学深度学习模型的性能和公平性上的潜力，特别是在数据受限的情况下。

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于封闭集假设，难以在现实场景中识别新颖对象及其属性。

Method: 利用基础模型弥合3D特征与文本的语义差距，同时实现空间关系、运动状态等属性的检测。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，OVODA在没有新类别锚点大小信息的情况下，超越了当前最先进的开放词汇3D目标检测方法。

Conclusion: OVODA展示了开放词汇条件下3D目标和属性检测的新可能性，并发布了OVAD数据集以推动研究。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Conclusion: 该网络在大规模天文巡天中显著提升了超新星检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型推理速度慢的问题，以便在实际高频率控制场景中提高实用性。

Method: 使用Normalizing Flow (NF) 替代扩散模型作为动作解码器，能够通过可逆变换实现单步采样。将NinA集成到FLOWER VLA架构中，并在LIBERO基准上进行微调。

Result: NinA在不影响性能的情况下，推理速度明显快于传统扩散模型对应的方法。

Conclusion: NinA是一种高效且快速的VLA控制解码器，在不牺牲性能的前提下，提升了实际应用的实用性与效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G时代的到来，系统吞吐量的需求以及6G技术的实现需要大规模天线阵列和精确的空间信道状态信息。然而，传统信道建模方法面临空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性的问题，因此需要一种更高效且精确的替代方案。

Method: 提出了基于平面高斯几何基元的优化方案，分为几何阶段和RF阶段：几何阶段实现与场景表面对齐的密集重建，RF阶段通过多视角损失准确模拟无线传播行为。

Result: 与现有的辐射场方法相比，RF-PGS在重建精度训练成本及信道表达效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: RF-PGS为6G空间信道状态信息建模提供了一种具有可扩展性和实践价值的解决方案。

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视网膜图像配准中大面积同质区域和稀疏血管特征导致的梯度信号不足。

Method: 通过初始粗配准提取关键点，利用高斯原始模型（包含训练参数如位置、位移和半径），随后使用KNN高斯插值传播位移，并通过多项损失函数进行优化。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上，目标配准误差从6.2px减少到约2.4px，AUC@25px从0.770提升到0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO提供了对视网膜图像配准的高效且鲁棒的解决方案，尤其解决了梯度信号不足问题。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Motivation: 旨在弥补现有多模态大语言模型在情感推理领域的不足，以提升人机交互的自然性与有效性。

Method: 提出MTMEUR基准，包含大量多模态数据，并设计一种多代理框架，每个代理负责不同方面的推理（如背景、角色动态、事件细节）。

Result: 通过基准测试发现，目前绝大多数多模态大模型在情感推理任务上仍存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法填补了一个未深度研究的领域，具有推动多模态情感推理能力提升的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

TL;DR: Delta-SVD是一种无训练压缩方法，通过SVD减少个性化生成模型的存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型需要微调大规模扩散模型，造成显著的存储开销。

Method: 利用SVD因式分解权重变化，通过基于能量的秩裁剪策略进行压缩，同时保持原始模型结构。

Result: Delta-SVD在多主体数据集上的实验表明可大幅压缩存储需求，生成质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: Delta-SVD是一个简单有效的解决方案，实现在实际情况下个性化扩散模型的高效部署。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Conclusion: 提出的视觉推理模式有助于推进情感计算，同时为未来研究确立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对恶劣天气多模态图像融合的新方法AWM-Fuse，结合文本和视觉信息以提高语义感知和图像融合质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气会导致视觉信息丢失，目前在多模态图像融合中很少充分利用文本信息，本文旨在解决这一问题，提供更清晰的场景表示。

Method: 提出AWM-Fuse方法，利用共享权重架构结合全局与局部文本感知。全局模块依靠BLIP生成的简要描述提取整体特征并识别主要退化类型；局部模块通过ChatGPT生成的详细场景描述捕捉具体退化效果。此外，文本描述还用于引导网络学习过程，实现融合图像的语义对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明，AWM-Fuse在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于现有技术水平。

Conclusion: AWM-Fuse在恶劣天气多模态图像融合中表现出色，并通过引入文本信息有效提升了视觉特征学习与语义感知。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Feecuin/AWM-Fuse.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多维图像质量评估框架，结合技术和美学维度，提升图像质量评估及其在人类视觉感知中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的图像质量评估方法主要追求拟合整体评分，但忽视了人类从不同维度评价图像质量的特点。

Method: 提出了MDIQA框架，分别从技术与美学的九个感知维度建模，通过不同分支提取特征并结合生成最终质量评分。此外，该模型可用于灵活训练图像修复模型。

Result: 实验显示MDIQA框架在图像质量评估中表现优越，并能有效灵活地应用于图像修复任务。

Conclusion: MDIQA克服了传统方法的局限，提供了更贴近人类感知的图像质量评估方式，同时在图像修复中具有灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEGS的无训练即插即用框架，通过在采样过程中引入结构能量梯度，解决Text-to-3D生成中的Janus问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-3D生成中存在多视角一致性不足的问题，导致几何形状从正面看正常但从其他角度可能发生畸变或重复。

Method: 引入Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS)框架，以PCA子空间中的结构能量为基础，在去噪过程中注入该能量的梯度，优化3D几何一致性，同时保留外观保真度。

Result: 整合到SDS/VSD管线后，SEGS显著降低了Janus伪影，提高了几何对齐度和多视角一致性。

Conclusion: SEGS无需重新训练或者权重修改，即可有效解决Text-to-3D生成的多视角一致性问题，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一个名为CC-CMR的框架，通过对比学习和跨模态对齐方法，实现无钆对比剂心肌病筛查，显示了优于现有方法的高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心肌病在心力衰竭和猝死中扮演关键角色，精准的早期筛查至关重要。然而，传统CMR诊断依赖钆对比剂，且解释过程繁琐，难以在大规模人群中推广。

Method: CC-CMR通过对运动CMR和晚期钆增强（LGE）序列的潜在空间进行对齐，捕捉纤维化相关的特征；同时，借助特征交互模块和不确定性引导的自适应训练机制，优化了诊断的精准性和模型的普适性。

Result: 在包含231名多中心的受试者数据评估中，CC-CMR的准确度达到0.943，较现有运动CMR模型提高4.3%，无需钆对比剂即可取得优越的性能。

Conclusion: CC-CMR框架无需依赖钆对比剂，具备良好的诊断性能和广泛适应性，展示了其在心肌病筛查以及不同医疗环境下的应用潜力。

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过开发Invert3D框架，该研究实现了3D内容的高效个性化，无需额外的计算密集型再训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D个性化方法通常依赖于计算昂贵的知识蒸馏方法，而如何便捷地实现3D个性化成为亟待解决的问题。

Method: 引入Invert3D框架，将3D表示与文本嵌入空间对齐，具体是通过一个相机条件的3D到文本反向机制将3D内容投射到与文本嵌入空间对齐的3D嵌入中，从而实现自然语言驱动下的高效个性化操作。

Result: 大量实验表明，Invert3D框架实现了对3D内容的有效个性化。

Conclusion: 通过Align 3D表示与文本嵌入，这种方法消除了再训练的需求，为3D内容个性化提供了一种高效、便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的目标攻击方法NAT，将攻击目标从模型的嵌入层面转为神经元特定层面，从而显著提高了对抗扰动的转移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到以往层级优化主要集中在表示相似概念的少数神经元，对整个攻击层的其他神经元影响较小，有必要更精细地优化。

Method: 通过直接针对嵌入层中的特定神经元进行干扰来破坏神经网络的核心单位，试图更高效地实现跨模型和跨域的转移攻击。

Result: 在41种ImageNet模型和9种细粒度模型上，通过NAT达成的误导率在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%。

Conclusion: NAT通过更细粒度的神经元优化策略，在解决跨模型和跨域转移攻击问题上取得了突破性成果，展示了其较强的通用性和高效性。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 传统方法仅提供综合评分，缺乏解释性和详细分析，限制了其实用性。因此，研究动机是开发一种能够详解评估过程并提供高解释性反馈的方法。

Method: 提出HieroAction模型，结合两个关键方法：分步骤动作推理，这种链式推理方法按步骤评估动作；以及分层策略学习，通过强化学习优化细粒度动作分析并提高得分精度。

Result: 通过对多种基准数据集的测试，HieroAction表现出优越的评估性能，同时具有准确性和解释性。

Conclusion: HieroAction成功改善了人类动作评估的结构化过程和可解释性，同时提高了精确度。研究成果表明该方法在多领域应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 通过四个真实场景数据集实验，显著超越现有方法，生成高质量、细节清晰且色彩还原度高的去雾图像。

Conclusion: RPD-Diff在复杂雾霾场景中表现优越，证实了其在处理稠密和非均匀雾霾下去雾任务中的先进性。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种强调模型局部建模能力的人群计数模型LIMM，通过窗口划分设计和窗口对比学习提升局部密度辨别能力，并结合全局注意模块以处理大尺寸个体问题，实验验证了其在多个数据集上的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考人群计数任务中的一个关键特点：目标通常占图像面积很小，现有方法未对此特性予以重点关注，因此提出提升局部建模能力的新设计原则。

Method: 提出LIMM模型，通过窗口划分设计以网格窗口处理输入数据，结合窗口对比学习强化局部密度区分能力，同时添加全局注意模块以处理较大个体。

Result: LIMM模型在多项公开数据集上进行了广泛实验，特别是在高密度数据集（如JHU-Crowd++）上的MAE提升了8.7%，并保持对大个体数量的精准计数能力。

Conclusion: LIMM模型基于局部信息建模的设计原则，成功在复杂场景下提升了人群计数的准确性，具有先进表现在业界属于前沿水平。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR)框架，通过Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency Verification (AMCV)机制提高了LVLMs在视觉扰动科学图表中的鲁棒性，并构建了SciDiagram-Robust数据集以及新的鲁棒性评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在应对科学图表中的视觉扰动方面表现不足，缺乏相应的评估基准。

Method: 提出RDR框架，通过AMCV机制生成诸多扰动版本图表并进行一致性验证，同时设计了两种新的鲁棒性评估指标（PRS和VDC）。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的LVLM（如GPT-4V）在遭遇视觉扰动时性能显著下降（清晰数据准确率85.2%，扰动鲁棒性得分72.1%）。

Conclusion: RDR框架和SciDiagram-Robust数据集有效提升了LVLMs在视觉扰动环境中的表现，并提供了评估鲁棒性的重要工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Result: 在多个视觉回归任务（如年龄和深度估计）中，BSAM方法超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: BSAM通过优化一般化能力，能够有效改善不平衡回归问题的性能，相关代码已公开。

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

irrespective of their realness. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art results
on the test dataset to meticulously detect Deepfake images.

Conclusion: JPS通过对预训练模型参数的稀疏选择性微调，成功实现了模型泛化能力和任务适应能力的平衡，并显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: HiCache成功解决现有扩散模型推理中的性能与质量矛盾，证明其在多种生成任务中的有效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

### [43] [Contrastive Prompt Clustering for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17009)
*Wangyu Wu,Zhenhong Chen,Xiaowen Ma,Wenqiao Zhang,Xianglin Qiu,Siqi Song,Xiaowei Huang,Fei Ma,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督语义分割方法Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC)，利用大语言模型挖掘类别间的关系，同时引入基于类别的对比损失，在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的弱监督语义分割方法多强调类别间的分隔，忽视了相关类别共享的语义，且缺乏细粒度辨别能力。

Method: 利用大语言模型挖掘类别聚类以编码类别间关系，并设计类感知的对比损失在细化边界的同时增强类别内一致性和类别间分离。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上的实验结果表明，CPC方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Contrastive Prompt Clustering框架通过层次化设计，在捕获类别间语义关系的同时改进了视觉相似类别的分割效果，提高了弱监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合框架，结合了神经渲染技术（比如Gaussian Splatting）和结构化标志表示，用于提升复杂场景下移动机器人训练的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于网格的3D模拟在复杂环境中效果不佳，而神经渲染虽具高视觉真实感，但缺乏灵活性以适应机器人所需的标志系统。

Method: 提出一种算法将高保真的GS渲染与结构标志（如AprilTags）相结合，能在复杂环境中有效生成标志并进行定位。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和姿态估计准确性上优于传统图像拟合技术，并在温室模拟环境中展示了其强大潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在挑战性农业环境中有效应用，强调了其在现实世界中的应用价值。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

*Konstantina Nikolaidou,George Retsinas,Giorgos Sfikas,Silvia Cascianelli,Rita Cucchiara,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为双正交引导(DOG)的新采样策略，旨在解决基于扩散的手写文本生成模型在处理风格多样性及生成清晰度时的不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成手写文本时容易记忆训练样本，并且在风格多样性和生成清晰度方面表现较差，特别是在生成难以实现的风格文本时会出现伪影或扭曲，影响可读性。

Method: 论文提出了双正交引导(DOG)策略，通过将一个负面扰动提示正交投影到原始正面提示上，避免伪影的产生，同时保持文本内容的完整性，并鼓励生成更多样化和合理的输出。此外，利用三角调度对引导强度进行分阶段控制：在降噪初期和末期时弱化引导，中间步骤时加强引导。

Result: 实验结果表明，在最先进的DiffusionPen和One-DM模型上应用DOG策略，显著提升了生成文本的内容清晰度和风格多样性，特别是在处理超出词汇范围的单词和复杂风格时表现优异。

Conclusion: DOG策略克服了传统扩散模型的局限性，不仅改善了手写文本的清晰度，还增强了风格的多样性，为手写文本生成任务提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PTMA模型，通过概率建模和GRU的时间掩码注意力单元，改善视频序列的在线动作检测，尤其是在跨视角情况下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线动作检测模型对视频视角的敏感性限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 设计了基于概率建模的PTMA模型，融合多视角信息，结合GRU时间掩码注意力单元进行视频序列分析。

Result: PTMA在DAHLIA、IKEA ASM和Breakfast数据集上的三种评估协议（cs、cv、csv）中均表现出领先性能。

Conclusion: PTMA模型成功在未见源的条件下，通过提取视角不变特征，提升了在线动作检测的效果。

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

*Mingliang Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Changhong Liu,Hanxi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Local Focus Mechanism (LFM)的新方法，用于提高跨类别和跨生成域的deepfake检测的鲁棒性与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前deepfake检测方法在不同对象类别和生成域间的泛化能力较差，本研究旨在解决深度卷积网络在此方面的局限性。

Method: 提出Local Focus Mechanism (LFM)，结合Salience Network (SNet)与Task-Specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)，通过显著性网络提取关键信息，并引入Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD)和Random-K Sampling (RKS)作为正则化技术以增强鲁棒性。

Result: LFM方法相较于现有最优方法（如NPR），在准确率上提高了3.7个百分点，平均精确率提高了2.8个百分点，并在单卡NVIDIA A6000 GPU上实现了1789 FPS的高效处理速度。

Conclusion: LFM方法有效提高了deepfake检测的泛化性能与效率，建立了跨域deepfake检测的新基准，并且开源代码提供了后续研究的支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化食品内容激增，需要能够进行精细化视觉理解与检索的系统，特别是在饮食监控、智能厨房及餐厅自动化等应用中食品图像与文本匹配的精度至关重要。

Method: 提出F4-ITS框架，采用一个无训练视觉语言模型，通过两大核心方法提升食物图像-文本匹配性能：1) 单、双向多模态融合策略将图像嵌入与文本描述结合以提高查询表达能力；2) 基于特征的重新排序机制利用预测的食品成分精炼检索结果。

Result: 在公开图像-文本编码器中，不同测试场景下，F4-ITS实现了显著涨幅：密集和稀疏标题下top-1检索分别提升约10%和7.7%，成分级别的top-k检索提升约28.6%；小型模型如ViT-B/32通过文本融合策略在资源受限场景下可媲美或超越更大型模型。

Conclusion: F4-ITS框架在多种基准测试中验证了其有效性，尤其在资源受限条件下表现优越，适合广泛应用场景。研究代码及测试数据将公开以供验证与使用。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as
images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this
problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Abstract: We present StyleClone, a method for training image-to-image translation
networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images.
Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image
generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating
diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face
images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this
augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that
outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on
multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality,
better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference.
Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques
and their impact on stylization performance.

Motivation: 当前LiDAR点云数据稀疏性严重阻碍了3D感知任务，现有方法主要针对独立物体，对复杂户外场景泛化能力有限。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到当前最优性能水平。

Conclusion: PVNet是首个支持场景级点云任意倍数采样的方法，有效提高了环境感知能力，源代码将公开。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法多基于双帧输入，忽略了时间域的重要信息，且多帧方法计算成本激增。

Method: 提出DeltaFlow框架，通过Δ方案提取时间特征，并设计Category-Balanced Loss和Instance Consistency Loss以解决类别不平衡和运动不一致问题。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和Waymo数据集上的表现达到了最先进水平，比现有最佳多帧方法错误率低22%、推理速度快约两倍。

Conclusion: DeltaFlow不仅提升了场景流估计的精度和效率，还展现了强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以维持语义一致性，难以生成完全符合提示的精细化视频内容。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段的解耦方法。首先通过预训练多模态模型生成包含空间提示的视觉信号，并结合文本作为联合条件输入轻量级SSG-Adapter与冻结的Video DiT主干。设计了双分支注意力机制以结合生成先验和外部空间信号。

Conclusion: 通过SSG-DiT框架方案，有效解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，提升了生成效果的精确度和保真度。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

TL;DR: 提出一种将ViT与近端工具整合的新框架，以增强特征表示和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在计算机视觉中的局限性在于其优化仅限于单张图像的局部关系，未能捕捉数据点间的全局几何关系。

Method: 通过整合ViT的自注意力机制和几何优化方法，创建切丛结构，由多个注意力头组成的切空间上完成特征对齐等操作。

Result: 实验结果证明该方法在分类准确性和数据分布方面优于传统ViT。

Conclusion: 结合几何优化的ViT框架有效提升了特征表征和分类性能，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Conclusion: PD-Loss在兼顾计算效率的同时，显著提升了分布感知能力，具有潜在的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新框架GRASP, 通过多模态大语言模型生成任务相关的边界框和正点信息，结合预训练分割模型以生成掩码,无需掩码的高密度监督,主要采用强化学习优化,并取得先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的多模态语言与掩码生成系统依赖昂贵的密集像素监督，其泛化性在领域外数据上弱，亟需一种更鲁棒且低成本的训练机制。

Method: 提出GRASP框架，使用多模态大语言模型生成边界框与重点提示，由预训练分割模型处理并生成掩码。无需掩码监督，通过强化学习以奖励机制优化模型。

Result: 实验结果表明该模型在领域内数据测试集提升4%，而在领域外数据基准测试中达到54%的显著改进，表现出强鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRASP展示了通过强化学习从弱空间提示中学习复杂地理空间分割的可能性，预期推动相关任务表现。代码与数据集将开源。

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个优化的轻量级模型SugarcaneShuffleNet和相关工具SugarcaneAI，用于快速在设备上诊断甘蔗叶部疾病，并提出了SugarcaneLD-BD数据集，展示在低资源环境下的高效和可解释性病害分类能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源地区，甘蔗种植者缺乏有效和可扩展的叶部病害诊断工具。此外，现有的深度学习模型易受现实条件的限制，且计算资源需求高，限制了其部署能力。

Method: 提出SugarcaneLD-BD数据集，结合两额外数据扩展其多样性；开发轻量级模型SugarcaneShuffleNet，通过传输学习与贝叶斯优化对多种神经网络进行比较；并将其应用到基于渐进式Web App的SugarcaneAI中，实现实时设备诊断和Grad-CAM可解释性病害判断。

Result: SugarcaneShuffleNet模型大小仅为9.26 MB，能以98.02%的分类准确率、F1分数0.98和平均推理时间4.14 ms实现实时诊断性能，优于或等于其他轻量级深度网络模型。

Conclusion: 论文贡献了一个多样化的基准数据集、一种高效的低资源模型和一个实用的甘蔗病害分类工具，能适应多种环境条件实现现场部署。

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入一种名为CE-RS-SBCIT的新型混合框架，结合CNN和Transformer模块，对脑肿瘤进行高精度分类和检测，解决了传统方法的多项缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在处理脑肿瘤MRI数据时存在计算量高、对比度变化敏感以及结构异质性等问题，需要一种更有效的框架以提升诊断和分类能力。

Method: 提出了一种整合残差和空间学习CNN与Transformer模块的混合框架CE-RS-SBCIT，包含关键创新：(i)平滑和边界的SBCIT，(ii)定制的残差与空间学习CNN，(iii)信道增强策略，(iv)空间注意机制。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare数据集上验证，框架在多种脑肿瘤分类中表现优异，达到98.30%准确率、98.08%敏感度、98.25% F1分数和98.43%精度。

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架以其高效的本地与全局特征建模、显著增强的分类表现及对细微特征的关注，为脑肿瘤的早期诊断和准确分类提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage
assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect.
Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a
27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is
designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural
damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from
no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The
methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023
Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013
Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy
of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results.
Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform
preliminary analyses, thereby improving the responsiveness and efficiency of

Motivation: 传统视频学习方式缺乏互动性，现有AI工具主要局限于转录和摘要功能，未能提供实时区域特定的互动。

Method: 通过结合GPT API和计算机视觉技术，将注释的视频帧集成到系统中，进行视频内容提取、处理与结构化。

Result: 提出的新方法解决了GPT-4o的空间弱点，实现了视频内容的更准确定位与解释。

Conclusion: Untwist可将被动的视频消费转变为互动的学习体验，显著提升用户参与度和理解力。

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

TL;DR: 利用隐式神经表示方法整合T1加权和T2加权MRI图像，开发了高分辨率、多模态的颞叶内侧亚区域分割模型，有助于更精准地诊断和追踪阿尔茨海默病。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于T2加权MRI分辨率受限，导致难以准确提取颞叶内侧亚区域皮层厚度，而颞叶内侧是阿尔茨海默病最早表现病变的区域，解决这一问题对于更早期、更准确地诊断和追踪病变具有重要意义。

Method: 通过隐式神经表示方法，结合T1加权和T2加权MRI的优点，将颞叶内侧亚区域从各向异性空间上采样到等方空间，开发了高分辨率、多模态的颞叶内侧亚区域图谱和分割模型。

Result: 使用该等方模型提取的亚区域厚度在区分轻度认知障碍人群与认知正常人群时表现出更高的显著性，并在纵向分析中表现出更大的稳定性。

Conclusion: 本研究方法在不增加图谱注释工作的情况下，提高了阿尔茨海默病成像生物标志物的精确性，有助于更准确地量化阿尔茨海默病与大脑萎缩的关系，并为疾病追踪提供更精准的测量手段。

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AdvCP的弱监督变化检测方法，通过对抗性提示生成与修正增强性能，减少背景变化误判为目标变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测旨在减少全监督方法对密集标注的需求，但由于仅使用图像级监督，常误将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂的遥感场景中。

Method: 提出Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP)方法，包括：1）对抗性提示挖掘，通过引入对抗性扰动激活错误的特征映射，识别可能被误判为目标变化的背景变化特征；2）对抗性样本修正，使用历史数据和当前批次构建全局原型，将这类对抗性样本纳入训练。

Result: 基于ConvNet、Transformer和SAM等基线模型的实验显示，AdvCP显著提升了性能；同时也证明了其在其他多类别弱监督密集预测任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AdvCP方法在不增加推理开销的情况下显著提高了弱监督变化检测的准确性，并具备广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Conclusion: 框架支持整合到现有的交通摄像系统中，尤其适合监控高风险区域，对资源有限的场景具有极大应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个新的4D视觉预训练框架（FVP），通过改进机器人学习中的3D表示来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模的3D数据，现有的方法主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D属性。研究旨在提出一个能够改进现有3D表示的通用视觉预训练框架。

Method: 提出了一种新的预训练框架FVP，将视觉预训练目标建模为下一个点云的预测问题，使用扩散模型并在公共数据集上进行预训练。

Result: FVP在12个现实世界机器人任务上的成功率平均提升了28%，并在模仿学习方法中达到了最新的性能。此外，FVP对不同的点云编码器和数据集均表现出适应性。

Conclusion: FVP通过改进机器人学习中的3D表示显著提升了机器人任务的性能，同时展示了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

### [71] [PersPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Perspective Encoding and Perspective Rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17239)
*Xiaoyang Hao,Han Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架PersPose，通过整合相机内参编码（Perspective Encoding, PE）和透视旋转（Perspective Rotation, PR），显著提升了性能，并在多个数据集上达到了最新的SOTA（state-of-the-art）技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目3D人体姿态估计方法依赖裁剪图像，但由于缺乏相机内参信息，难以精确估计关节的相对深度。此外，当人体在原图中远离中心时，会导致透视失真，这增加了模型拟合的难度。

Method: 本文提出了两个关键技术：1）Perspective Encoding（PE），通过编码裁剪图像的相机内参以提升深度估计精度；2）Perspective Rotation（PR），通过对原图进行变换使人体位于中心，从而减少透视畸变并改善模型拟合性能。

Result: 提出的PersPose在3DPW、MPIINF-3DHP和Human3.6M等多个数据集上表现优越，其中在3DPW上的MPJPE为60.1 mm，比之前的SOTA方法低7.54%。

Conclusion: 通过引入Perspective Encoding和Perspective Rotation技术，这篇文章显著提高了单目3D人体姿态估计的性能，为该领域的研究提供了新的思路和方法，并验证了其在多个数据集上的有效性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

*Zicong Tang,Ziyang Ma,Suqing Wang,Zuchao Li,Lefei Zhang,Hai Zhao,Yun Li,Qianren Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoViPAL的方法，通过层次化上下文的视觉令牌裁剪，减少冗余视觉数据的处理量，从而降低大规模视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）的计算成本和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉-语言模型因图像或视频中的丰富视觉信息而生成了大量视觉令牌，导致推理过程中的高计算和内存消耗问题。现有方法在裁剪冗余视觉令牌时表现有限，尤其是在浅层中上下文信息不足的情况下。

Method: 提出CoViPAL，一种层次化上下文的视觉令牌裁剪方法。通过Plug-and-Play Pruning Module（PPM）预测并去除冗余视觉令牌，PPM模块轻量化、模型无关，可与不同模型无缝结合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CoViPAL在相同令牌预算下超越了无训练裁剪方法，同时在带有可比监督的情况下优于训练型方法。

Conclusion: CoViPAL是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够在不影响准确性的情况下，提高LVLMs的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

*Lixin Jia,Haiyang Sun,Zhiqing Guo,Yunfeng Diao,Dan Ma,Gaobo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文提出了一种叫做AIS的训练范式，旨在提升深伪图像取证水印的鲁棒性，防止多重水印嵌入攻击（MEA）对原始水印的破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深伪技术的发展和数字媒体传播使得个人隐私面临严重威胁，现有的基于水印嵌入的主动取证方法无法应对现实中的多重嵌入攻击问题。

Method: 提出了一种通用的训练范式，称为Adversarial Interference Simulation（AIS），通过在微调过程中模拟MEA场景，并引入一种新的损失函数促进水印稀疏性和稳定性的学习。

Result: 实验表明，AIS能够显著提高现有多种取证方法对MEA攻击的鲁棒性，使水印在二次嵌入之后仍然能够被正确提取。

Conclusion: AIS作为一种可插拔的训练范式可增强主动取证水印在复杂攻击场景下的有效性，解决了多重嵌入攻击带来的问题。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

*Xiao Zhang,Kai-Fu Yang,Xian-Shi Zhang,Hong-Zhi You,Hong-Mei Yan,Yong-Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICPNet的新型深度网络，旨在解决传统深度神经网络难以感知虚幻轮廓的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度神经网络虽然在多种任务中表现优异，但在感知虚幻轮廓（如错视轮廓）方面与人类感知存在显著差异。

Method: 提出了名为ICPNet的模型，该模型灵感来源于视觉皮层电路，包括三个核心模块：多尺度特征投射模块（MFP）、特征交互注意模块（FIAM）和边缘融合模块（EFM）。这些模块分别实现多尺度特征提取、前馈与反馈特征交互强化以及通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束。

Result: 实验在AG-MNIST测试集和新构建的AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上进行，ICPNet在感知虚幻轮廓的敏感度和top-1准确率上均显著优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: ICPNet为基于深度神经网络的模型向人类智能感知水平迈出了一步，特别是在虚幻轮廓感知方面的表现更接近人类能力。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统多假设静态或单视角环境，无法有效应对动态驾驶场景。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度引导的视觉-语言框架，通过两个SLAM分支跟踪动态场景，并结合GPT生成相关增强现实信息。

Result: 实验表明该方法能增强场景理解、增强信息相关性以及驾驶的易操作性。

Conclusion: SEER-VAR 提供了一个有效的框架，未来开放代码和数据集将支持进一步研究。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code
and dataset will be made open source.

Method: 提出Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification (CLIFF)，通过冻结基础模型并为新材料学习特定的prompt、嵌入和delta head，同时使用prompt池和余弦相似度门进行特征调整并结合记忆回放和知识蒸馏。

Result: CLIFF在保持低遗忘率的同时，达到与其他方法相当的分类准确性。

Conclusion: CLIFF框架克服了材料外观变化的问题，为实现基于光学显微镜的高效、精准的量子材料层分类提供了一种新颖的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作中的可学习指导模型难以在训练过程中保持最佳状态，因此需要一种方法确保知识有效传输。

Method: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过两个独立的损失函数动态调整指导模型，以增强其参与度和效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上的实验表明，AdaGAT方法在多种对抗攻击下显著增强了目标模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态调整指导模型的训练状态是实现更高鲁棒性目标模型的有效策略。

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines

Motivation: 当前手动检测肌肉减少症的骨骼肌面积耗时且加重临床负担，因此需要一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用转移学习和自监督学习方法，结合标签和非标签数据集，开发深度学习模型对CT图像中的SMA进行测量和分割。

Result: 模型平均误差为±3个百分点，预测掩码的平均Dice相似系数达93%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，该方法可实现肌肉减少症评估的全自动化，推动临床检测的高效性。

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

Conclusion: MTNet通过模态感知与全局特性融合，显著提升了RGBT跟踪的鲁棒性和效率，能广泛适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Conclusion: QTT-SEG展示了显著的性能改进与潜力，为图像分割领域特定任务提供了一种强有力的自动化模型调整方法示范。

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

### [84] [FoundDiff: Foundational Diffusion Model for Generalizable Low-Dose CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17299)
*Zhihao Chen,Qi Gao,Zilong Li,Junping Zhang,Yi Zhang,Jun Zhao,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FoundDiff的低剂量CT图像去噪方法，利用对比学习和扩散模型实现跨剂量和解剖区域的通用与适应性去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法，通常针对特定剂量水平和解剖区域进行训练，难以适应多样化的噪声特性和解剖异质性，限制了其在临床场景中的泛化与鲁棒性。

Method: 构建FoundDiff模型，分为两个阶段：（1）基于对比学习的剂量与解剖感知模型（DA-CLIP），实现剂量与解剖特征的鲁棒感知；（2）基于剂量与解剖感知扩散模型（DA-Diff），通过创新的剂量与解剖条件区块（DACB）进行适应性去噪。

Result: 在涵盖八种剂量水平和三个解剖区域的两个公共低剂量CT数据集上，FoundDiff相较于现有方法表现出色，并能对未见剂量水平表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff方法通过联合剂量感知和解剖感知机制，为实现通用化和鲁棒的低剂量CT图像去噪提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

TL;DR: 提出了PosBridge，一个无需训练的高效图像编辑框架，通过位置嵌入移植和角对齐布局实现定制对象的插入，展示了卓越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对生成模型训练成本高和需要高效图像编辑的方法需求。

Method: 基于位置嵌入移植法和角对齐布局，通过逐步去噪及FLUX.1-Fill模型导向，保证了对象插入的结构一致性与外观真实性。

Result: 实验证明PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真与计算效率上优于主流方法。

Conclusion: PosBridge展示出其实际价值和广泛应用潜力，是一种无需训练且高效灵活的编辑框架。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚焦麦作物语义分割问题与其自然特性，辨别关键要素以提升模型表现，尤其在麦茎这种细微结构的分割中面临许多挑战。

Method: 在ViT-Adapter基础上进行三项改进：1) 动态上采样器SAPA用于增强细节刻画；2) 半监督引导蒸馏结合茎相关样本选择；3) 测试时缩放策略实现分辨率提升。

Result: 通过这三项改进，成功赢得挑战赛第一名，显著领先第2名，进一步证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 深耕领域问题本质，专注结构困难点以提出针对性改进，可成为语义分割问题中在细结构处理上的借鉴方案。

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种基于面部纹理特征的主动Deepfake检测方法，通过在图像编辑之前植入不可见的纹理扰动，有效扭曲Deepfake生成与导致明显视觉缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Deepfake检测方法多为被动分析，面对高质量Deepfake内容难以解决。需要一种能在图像编辑前主动防御的方法。

Method: 通过Local Binary Patterns(LBP)提取初步纹理特征，采用双模型注意力策略，生成并优化纹理区域的扰动信号，局部植入到关键的低感知显著性区域，并尽量减少非纹理区域的噪声。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CelebA-HQ与LFW数据集上显示出对Deepfake内容进行干扰与生成明显视觉缺陷的能力，表现出较强的广泛适用性和效率。

Conclusion: 本方法为主动Deepfake检测提出了新的解决思路，可有效打击Deepfake技术的泛滥，并提高信息与社会信任的保障。

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SpecGen算法，通过单张RGB图生成光谱双向反射率函数（BRDF），实现了光谱图像的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光谱BRDF数据稀缺问题，同时实现从RGB到光谱图像渲染的更高精度转换。

Method: 提出了光谱-空间三平面聚合（SSTA）网络，利用RGB BRDF数据训练增强光谱BRDF生成能力。

Result: 方法在有限的光谱数据下准确重建了光谱BRDF，超越了现有方法，在PSNR指标上提升了8 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光谱图像生成中的数据和精度问题，并将在相关领域有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 评估大规模视觉语言模型在处理半结构化表格图像中的复杂数值推理和跨语言能力的局限性。

Method: 创建了1,463个人工生成的板球记分牌图像，并配套1,500个英文问答对，同时分为两部分：英文数据集和包含印地语记分牌的跨语言数据集。所有问答内容均为英文，以便进行控制变量实验。

Conclusion: 现有模型在结构化视觉文本理解、数值推理及跨语言泛化方面存在明显不足。

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured
tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated
scorecard images from ODI, T20, and Test formats, accompanied by 1,500 English
QA pairs. It includes two subsets: MMCRICBENCH-E-1.5K, featuring English
scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical
data, multi-image context, and implicit domain knowledge. Empirical results
show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,
and cross-lingual generalization. The dataset is publicly available via Hugging

Conclusion: HiDA-Net的高效设计和新数据集的引入，为高分辨率AI生成图像的检测提供了新的解决方案，在性能上显著优于现有方法并促进相关领域研究的发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon
dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文作者提出了一种名为DiCache的训练无关适应性缓存策略，用于加速扩散模型运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缓存加速的方法通常基于经验法则或数据集先验，难以处理扩散过程的动态变化，尤其是在异常样本上的表现较差。

Method: DiCache包含两个主要组件：(1) 在线探测剖析方案，通过浅层在线探测实时获取缓存误差的稳定先验，自主决定缓存计划；(2) 动态缓存轨迹对齐，基于浅层探测特征轨迹结合多步缓存，更好地逼近当前特征。

Result: 实验表明，DiCache在包括WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo和Flux等领先扩散模型上的效率和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiCache为当前缓存方法提供了一种统一框架，实现了更高效能和更高视觉保真度的加速效果。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对每种条件训练独立的分支，存在冗余和计算资源浪费的问题，因此提出更高效和表达力更强的统一框架。

Method: 引入了Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块减少冗余，并通过WeaveNet机制加强全局与局部控制分支之间的交互连接。

Result: 在Subjects-200K和MultiGen-20M数据集上的多个任务中，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniGen展现了在条件图像生成任务上的多样性和高效性，验证了其在不同条件下生成图像的能力。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学诊断中对图像的分析依赖检索相关的视觉信息，而现有技术未能充分利用LVLM的错误信号来优化检索过程，存在改进空间。

Method: 研究开发了一种联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的新模型，与现有的检索增强生成（RAG）相比，能更好地传播LVLM的错误信号，并只使用轻量级微调生成结果。

Result: 该模型在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务中取得了与医学预训练模型相当的结果，并在处理挑战性任务时明显优于标准RAG。

Conclusion: 尽管模型性能已显著提升，但与理想诊断仍有较大差距，现有技术仍不能完全解决该问题，未来仍有进一步优化的空间。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

method skillfully integrates two deep convolutional neural network models,
VGG19 and ResNet50, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities
to perform multi-scale and multi-level deep feature analysis of underwater

effect, this paper introduces image quality assessment metrics such as PSNR,
UCIQE, and UIQM to quantitatively compare images before and after enhancement
and deeply analyzes the performance of different models in different
scenarios.Furthermore, to improve the practicality and stability of the
underwater visual enhancement system, this paper also provides practical
suggestions from aspects such as model optimization, multi-model fusion, and
hardware selection, aiming to provide strong technical support for visual

Conclusion: MoCo提出了基于结构和外观生成的解耦策略，结合动态控制模块和新的数据集，成功解决了人体视频生成中的运动一致性和多样性问题。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

Motivation: 尽管Segment Anything Model (SAM) 在医疗图像分割中表现出色，但其在不确定性信息处理方面存在细调不稳定、高计算成本以及设计上的黑箱问题。针对这一问题，作者提出解决方案以更好地满足医疗应用的需求。

Method: 作者提出了E-BayesSAM框架，将T-VBI技术引入，重新定义SAM的输出token为动态的概率权重，并通过无辅助训练实现不确定性估计。同时引入SO-KAN，通过可学习的样条函数优化token预测，并利用自监督学习提高效率与精度。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM通过整合效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM从通用性提升至满足临床需求的水平，为安全关键的医疗应用部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

*Patrick Ramos,Ryan Ramos,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究视觉数据集中的数据泄露问题，表明数据泄露可能会影响模型的公平评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模数据集往往来源于互联网，其中许多计算机视觉基准测试是公开的，因此研究数据泄露现象的影响显得尤为重要。

Method: 使用图像检索技术来分析视觉数据集中可能存在的泄露现象，并根据泄露的模式、覆盖范围和程度对其进行了分类和研究。

Result: 所有分析的数据集中都存在某种形式的泄露，无论是严重的还是细微的泄露都会影响下游任务中模型评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: 数据泄露不仅普遍存在，还会对模型的公平性评估造成负面影响，因此需要采取措施防止其发生。

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair
model evaluation. Given that large-scale datasets are often sourced from the
internet, where many computer vision benchmarks are publicly available, our
efforts are focused into identifying and studying this phenomenon. We
characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

*Xiaojie Yin,Qilong Wang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种约束提示增强（CPE）方法，通过构造完整的文本提示和紧凑的视觉提示，从语义角度改进视觉-文本对齐，以提升零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在网络规模数据上的预训练虽然具备出色的零样本泛化能力，但因预训练与下游任务之间的域差异导致语义对齐不良。

Method: 提出了包含两个核心组件的CPE方法：1）拓扑指导的同义语义生成（TGSSG）：通过大语言模型生成每个类别的同义语义集合来应对文本提示的不完整语义表达问题，并基于语义模糊熵和持续同调分析构建全面文本提示；2）类别无关的区分性区域选择（CADRS）：利用预训练视觉模型的激活图识别区分性区域，从而去除随机裁剪引入的无关视觉噪声并生成紧凑视觉提示。

Result: 本文提出基于测试时自适应（TTA）和优化传输（OT）的两种集合匹配策略，利用全面的文本提示和紧凑的视觉提示，实现了有效的视觉-文本对齐，从而增强了VLMs的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过全面的文本和视觉提示以及合适的匹配策略，CPE方法有效解决了语义对齐和域差异问题，显著提升了VLMs的表现。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

### [99] [Robust Point Cloud Registration via Geometric Overlapping Guided Rotation Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17427)
*Zhao Zheng,Jingfan Fan,Long Shao,Hong Song,Danni Ai,Tianyu Fu,Deqiang Xiao,Yongtian Wang,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于几何最大重叠的点云配准框架，通过仅旋转的BnB搜索，实现高效的刚性变换估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高离群比下表现优异，但图构方法计算复杂度高，多阶段BnB搜索方法易受局部最优影响。

Method: 利用Chasles定理，将刚性变换分解为沿旋转轴的平移和二维刚性变换。通过旋转轴和角度的BnB搜索，以及配准参数的范围查询问题解决。具体包括在半球内搜索候选旋转轴，并通过扫线算法和线段树解决几何重叠问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上超越了现有方法，在准确性和效率上均有显著提升，且时间复杂度多项式增长，空间复杂度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该框架在保证高效性的同时，显著提升了在高噪声场景下的点云配准精度，提供了一种复杂度更低的解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

*Po-Hsien Yu,Yu-Syuan Tseng,Shao-Yi Chien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出的FedKLPR框架通过引入KLL、KLPWA、SAS和CRR四种机制，有效解决了非IID数据及通信开销问题，在性能与效率间达成良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人群重识别领域，传统集中的数据训练方式存隐私隐患。联邦学习虽然保护隐私，但面对客户数据分布不均和高频模型传输等现实挑战，需要改进方法。

Method: FedKLPR框架包括四个主要部分：1) KL散度正则化损失（KLL）稳定非IID条件下的收敛; 2) KL散度裁剪加权聚合（KLPWA）在减少通信开销的同时增强全局模型鲁棒性; 3) 稀疏激活跳过（SAS）避免参数稀释; 4) 交叉轮次恢复（CRR）通过动态裁剪控制优化模型准确性与压缩率。

Result: 实验表明，FedKLPR在八个基准数据集上显著降低通信量：相比最新方法，ResNet-50通信成本降33%-38%，ResNet-34通信成本降20%-40%，模型准确性降低不超过1%。

Conclusion: FedKLPR通过轻量化设计与高效通信，在保障准确性的同时显著提升性能，为联邦学习在实际场景中应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个名为TinySR的小型扩散模型，用于实现实际图像超分辨率（Real-ISR），通过降维和改进的参数设计提高速度并保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在恢复高质量图像时性能优异，但因多次迭代降噪过程导致推理时间较长，不适合实时应用，而现有快速推理方案存在参数过于繁重的问题。

Method: 提出一个轻量化扩散模型TinySR，采用动态块间激活和扩展-腐蚀策略优化深度修剪性能，并通过通道剪枝、注意力模块移除及轻量化的SepConv实现VAE压缩。另外，去掉时间和提示相关模块，并使用预缓存技术加速模型运行。

Result: TinySR在保持高视觉质量的前提下，相较于TSD-SR实现了最多5.68倍的速度提升和83%的参数减少。

Conclusion: TinySR成功在保持高清恢复效果的同时显著减小了扩散模型的计算成本和模型尺寸，为实时图像超级分辨率任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本生成图像（T2I）模型在实际应用中难以实现细粒度、迭代的图像编辑需求。

Method: 提出一个名为 RefineEdit-Agent 的框架，结合了大语言模型（LLM）的规划能力和视觉语言大模型（LVLM）的视觉理解能力，并采用闭环系统进行指令解析、编辑规划、图像编辑和反馈评估。

Result: 在提出的新基准 LongBench-T2I-Edit 上，RefineEdit-Agent 显著优于其他模型（得分为3.67，而其他模型得分范围为 2.29-3.39）。

Conclusion: RefineEdit-Agent 在编辑准确性和上下文保留方面表现出色，是解决复杂图像编辑挑战的有效方法。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the
development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper,
we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on
an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE),
which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify
CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a
large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised
manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and
evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks,
namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality
estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion
recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合DINO和Barlow Twins的混合模型，在仅使用10%的标注数据情况下实现了与DINO相当的性能，特别是在资源有限的环境中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型需要大量标注数据和计算资源，本研究旨在克服这些障碍，探索更高效的无监督学习方法。

Method: 结合DINO的自蒸馏策略和Barlow Twins的冗余消除目标，设计出一种混合模型，并在MS COCO数据集上使用仅10%的标注数据进行训练和评估。

Result: 混合模型在分类准确性上与DINO相当，并具有更强的特征表示能力，同时显著节省了计算与数据需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为在资源受限环境中进行高效、标签节约型的视觉Transformer训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: OmniMRI是一个统一的视觉-语言基础模型，旨在整合MRI全流程并实现通用化，其在从影像重建到报告生成的多任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MRI工作流程复杂且碎片化，且现有深度学习方法难以泛化到多种临床场景，也缺乏影像与文本的有机结合。

Method: 提出OmniMRI模型，基于60个公共数据集的220,000个MRI体积和19百万张切片，通过自监督视觉预训练、视-语言对齐、多模态预训练及多任务指令微调进行模型训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，OmniMRI能在MRI重建、解剖及病理分割、异常检测、诊断建议及报告生成等任务中实现多样化表现。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将碎片化的MRI工作流程整合至一个可扩展且通用的框架，为影像与临床语言统一建模开辟了道路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

Result: 具有跳跃连接的1维卷积分类器、ResNet50预训练骨干及部分骨干解冻策略，在医学分类执行中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，转移学习有效提升医学影像分类性能，但RadImageNet并未显示出明显优于ImageNet的预训练效果。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Motivation: 超材料的几何构造复杂，设计难度高，且结构与性能之间的非显性映射增加了挑战性，需要一种高效的方法来处理这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种综合性框架，包括：1）MetaDSL——一种简明、语义丰富的领域特定语言，用于描述超材料设计；2）MetaDB——包含超过15万种参数化设计及相关属性的经过整理的数据库；3）MetaBench——用于测试相关视觉-语言模型核心能力的基准套件。

Result: 通过微调视觉-语言模型、部署全能模型和交互式设计接口，案例研究证明了此框架能有效支持超材料设计中的结构、属性关系的理解与操作。

Conclusion: 该框架为超材料设计与性能预测提供了一个集成化的起点，有助于构建结构-表现关系的认知并支持便捷的设计过程。

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决战场条件动态变化导致3D虚拟环境频繁更新成本高、耗时的问题。

Method: 利用相机姿态估计对齐新图像与现有3D模型，接着用变化检测识别场景改动，并通过3D生成AI创建高质量新元素，最后通过人工指导确保准确整合。

Result: 该方法的大幅减少更新时间与劳动成本，为快速变化军事场景下的3D模型维护提供了低成本的解决方案。

Conclusion: IDU管道用小规模新增图像即可高效更新3D模型，展示了在动态场景中保持3D环境实时性和准确性的潜力。

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出HERO，一个无训练的分层加速框架，解决生成驱动型世界模型中扩散模型推理缓慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前生成驱动的世界模型中，扩散模型推理效率低的问题限制了其实用性，而现有解决方案会对质量造成损伤。

Method: HERO框架通过对世界模型的多模态特性进行分析，提出了两个加速策略：浅层实现基于补丁的刷新机制，深层应用线性外插方案直接估算中间特征。

Result: HERO在实验中实现了1.73倍的加速，并仅带来极小的质量下降，显著优于现有的扩散加速方法。

Conclusion: HERO框架高效提升了世界模型的推理速度，同时保留了较高的输出质量，具有较大的实用性。

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: HotSpotter是一种通用、高效、准确的个体识别工具，适用于不同物种和大规模数据库。

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Vision Transformer（ViT）的多任务学习框架，使用基线MRI以及加权策略预测ADAS-Cog全球评分及其13个子评分，有效提升阿尔兹海默症（AD）预后预测的准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多聚焦于预测ADAS-Cog全球评分，忽略了13个子评分在不同认知领域的重要性，因此需要挖掘子评分的预测价值以提升整体预测性能。

Method: 研究设计了加权ViT多任务学习框架，通过赋予子评分不同的损失权重，结合基线MRI扫描数据共同预测ADAS-Cog全球评分及其13个子评分。

Result: 结果表明，加权策略的效果因群体而异：较强权重对MCI患者更有效，而中等权重对CN患者更有利；而统一权重限制了关键子评分的贡献和模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过灵活的加权策略实现了基于MRI的解读性预测，为阿尔兹海默症的早期诊断和干预提供了一种新的工具。

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Conclusion: 提出的JCo-MVTON框架显著提升了虚拟试穿的表现，在定量指标和人类评估中均表现优异，并在商业系统中具有广泛实用性。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog整体分数，忽视了子分数的预测价值，而子分数可以反映领域特定的认知衰退。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，同时预测全球和子分数；使用Vision Transformer (ViT)和Swin Transformer提取成像特征并结合纵向临床数据建模认知进展。

Result: 结合子分数学习提高了全球评分预测，分析显示部分子分数（如Q1、Q4、Q8）对全球分数贡献显著，但亦伴随高预测误差。

Conclusion: 强调改进多模态融合和自适应损失权重设计，提出了一种子分数驱动、更具解释性和临床稳健性的AD预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

*Ryan Faulkner,Ian Reid,Simon Ratcliffe,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba架构的开放集分割方法，应用于大规模点云数据，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在使用LiDAR扫描获取大规模点云数据时，环境中不可避免会出现训练数据之外的异常对象，因此需要开发有效的开放集分割方法。

Method: 结合物体缺陷检测研究成果与Mamba架构的优势，提出基于重建的开放集分割方法，同时设计了一种基于Mamba的网络架构。

Result: 该方法不仅提升了对作者自有开放集分割方法的性能，同时在现有方法中也表现出了改进效果。

Conclusion: Mamba架构不仅适用于大规模点云数据，还能在开放集分割场景中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

TL;DR: Wound3DAssist是一个基于智能手机视频的3D伤口评估框架，可实现非接触、自动、独立于视角且对相机运动具有鲁棒性的伤口测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前慢性伤口的临床评估方法存在主观性强且效率低的问题，传统2D测量技术存在视角畸变、视野限制及难以捕捉深度等缺陷，尤其在解剖复杂或弯曲部位的评估时更为明显。

Method: 提出Wound3DAssist框架，利用消费级单镜头视频生成精确的3D模型，集成3D重建、伤口分割、组织分类及周围分析，形成模块化工作流程。

Result: 该框架在几何已知的数字模型、硅胶模型及真实患者上的实验验证，其伤口床可视化效果出色，精度达到毫米级，组织组成分析可靠，完整评估流程可在20分钟内完成。

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist框架有效地解决了传统方法的局限，为临床伤口评估提供了一种快速、精确的解决方案，具有实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

### [126] [Few-Shot Pattern Detection via Template Matching and Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17636)
*Eunchan Jo,Dahyun Kang,Sanghyun Kim,Yunseon Choi,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TMR的新方法，用于解决少样本模式检测问题，并引入了一个新的数据集RPINE，用以涵盖比现有数据集更广泛的模式范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的少样本目标计数和检测方法集中在目标类别模式上，难以定位非目标模式且丢失了样本的结构信息。

Method: 提出一种简洁有效的检测器TMR，基于模板匹配和回归，通过冻结的主干网络和少量可学习的卷积或投影层来保留和利用样本的空间布局。

Result: TMR在RPINE、FSCD-147和FSCD-LVIS三个基准上优于最新方法，并在跨数据集评估中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TMR方法证明了少样本模式检测领域中模板匹配与回归的有效性，并通过引入RPINE丰富了数据集覆盖范围。

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

### [127] [Dynamic Embedding of Hierarchical Visual Features for Efficient Vision-Language Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17638)
*Xinyu Wei,Guoli Yang,Jialu Zhou,Mingyue Yang,Leqian Li,Kedi Zhang,Chunping Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DEHVF的方法，以动态嵌入与融合分层视觉特征解决大模型在视觉-语言任务中的长序列问题，展现了其高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型方法导致输入序列过长，增加计算开销，且忽略了模型的分层语义表征与浅层视觉信息。

Method: 引入了一种轻量的分层视觉融合器，根据语言模型每层内部表征动态选择和融合分层特征，并将其嵌入对应层的前馈网络中。

Result: 在多个视觉-语言基准测试上取得了优于现有参数高效调优方法的表现，包括ScienceQA上的视觉问答和COCO Captions上的图像描述任务。

Conclusion: DEHVF通过动态和分层的方式在语义粒度上实现了高效精准的跨模态信息对齐与补充，保证训练与推理的高效性，同时达到更高精度。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的混合损失函数HyTver，用于解决多发性硬化症病灶分割中的数据和分割不平衡问题。在保持距离相关指标表现的同时，取得了良好的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多发性硬化症病灶分割中数据和结果的不平衡问题，特别是针对现有损失函数的性能和计算复杂性不足的挑战。

Method: 开发了一种称为HyTver的混合损失函数，该函数旨在在保证性能的同时减少计算复杂度，并对其在各种指标上的表现进行了广泛的评估和比较。

Result: 新模型在Dice得分上达到了0.659，同时在距离指标上也表现良好。相比现有流行损失函数，表现更为稳定和优秀。

Conclusion: HyTver是一种有效的损失函数，不仅在分割性能上表现出色，还兼具对其他重要指标的稳定性，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 绝大多数AI在农业领域缺乏普适性，难以应对广泛多样的植物种类和疾病。

Method: 提出FloraSyntropy-Net框架，结合联邦学习和模因算法，优化模型选择，同时引入创新的深度模块和客户端克隆策略。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了有价值的资源，还展示了其高度的普适性，推动了大规模农业AI的实用性发展。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于点云的冠状动脉补全数据集（PC-CAC）和新的网络模型TSRNet，旨在解决现有算法在病患复杂条件下的管状结构中断问题，并在多个数据集上取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割算法在处理严重的病患情况（如冠状动脉狭窄和血管闭塞）时，易出现结构不连续，从而影响诊断准确性，亟需一种方法以重新连接断开的管状结构并确保其完整性。

Method: 提出采用基于点云的方法首次研究管状结构补全，构建PC-CAC数据集，同时开发TSRNet网络模型，集成了细节特征提取、多重密集优化策略及全球到本地的损失函数。

Result: 在PC-CAC数据集和两个公开数据集（PC-ImageCAS和PC-PTR）上的实验表明，本文方法在多个指标上均优于现有技术，成为点云管状结构重建的新基准。

Conclusion: 通过提出新数据集和创新方法，为复杂医疗场景下的管状结构问题提供了一种高效且创新的解决方案，改善了重建效果并提升了诊断的潜在准确性。

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available
at https://github.com/YaoleiQi/PCCAC.

TL;DR: 提出了M^3-GloDet框架评估肾病理学中病变肾小球检测模型性能，并发现中等放大倍率和补丁大小平衡性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型主要关注正常肾小球或全局硬化类型，而对更广泛的病变肾小球亚型研究较少，限定性特征识别困难。

Method: 设计了一种M^3-GloDet框架，针对多种检测模型和肾小球病变亚型进行系统实验，包括不同区域、尺度和类别多样性。

Result: 发现中等大小图像区域提供了情境和效率间的最佳平衡，而中等放大倍率可以减少过拟合，提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过探索现有模型的优劣，提供了改进自动化检测策略的新见解，为数字病理学诊断提供了支持。

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

Result: 实验表明，CEIDM在实体控制及其交互控制方面优于当前代表性方法。

Conclusion: CEIDM通过结合语言模型、交互动作调节和实体控制网络，有效解决了实体与交互控制的难题，显著提升了生成图像的质量。

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Conclusion: 框架通过更深入的医疗图像表示和伪样本生成方法，有效增强了未知疾病的检测能力。

Abstract: In trustworthy medical diagnosis systems, integrating out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection aims to identify unknown diseases in samples, thereby
mitigating the risk of misdiagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OOD
detection framework based on vision-language models (VLMs), which integrates
hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理长视频时存在计算复杂性高的问题，需要有效的方法降低计算成本。

Method: 提出了LGTTP方法，利用语言线索进行动态的视频令牌修剪，同时保留上下文连续性，适用于各种模型框架。

Result: LGTTP减少了65%的计算量，同时保持97-99%的性能；在视频高光提问和动作定位任务中表现优秀。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的前提下显著提升了计算效率，尤其适用于存在时间线索的视频任务。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on

temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前深层神经网络在VSR任务上表现出色，但其高计算成本限制了在资源受限的实际场景中的应用，需要设计低成本的解决方案。

Method: 本文采用标准的双网络设计框架：一个网络处理视觉特征提取，另一个网络利用提取的特征进行序列分类，结合轻量级设计在时序卷积网络上开发端到端架构，参考图像分类文献中高效模型的轻量化块设计。

Result: 所提出的模型在最大规模的公共英语单词数据库上进行了实验，结果证明模型既高效又实用。

Conclusion: 本文开发了一系列资源需求较低但性能强大的统一模型，有助于扩大VSR系统在实际场景中的适用性及部署。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的 Fine-grained Fragment Retrieval (FFR) 任务，并构建了一个长对话数据集MLDR，专注于在多模态长对话中检索语义相关的片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话检索方法不足以满足用户从长对话中找到语义连贯内容的需求。

Method: 提出了F2RVLM模型，采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调和基于GRPO的强化学习，并引入了难度感知课程采样方法。

Result: F2RVLM在域内和真实场景中均优于流行的视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 提出的F2RVLM模型通过有效检索语义相关片段，提升了长对话检索的表现。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以动态适应用户不断变化的偏好，且多需预先收集喜好数据或微调模型，缺乏实时性。

Method: 框架分为偏好理解和偏好引导生成两部分，偏好理解利用多模态大语言模型从参考图像提取偏好信号并完善提示词；偏好引导生成通过关键词控制和局部区域注意机制调节扩散模型，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 该方法改进了实时文本到图像生成的用户偏好对齐能力，支持多轮交互优化，为对话式生成和多模态模型与扩散模型的整合开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要对每个类别单独训练模型，并需要大量正常数据，这限制了在稀缺或新类别数据场景中的应用。

Method: 使用对比学习构建类别无关的表示空间，通过支持集对比实现异常检测；引入基于扩散模型的生成运动增强策略，提升泛化性及鲁棒性。

Result: 在HumanAct12数据集上的实验显示，无论是已知类别还是未知类别，本方法在训练效率和小样本HAAD可扩展性上均达到最优。

Conclusion: 提出的方法突破了现有HAAD方法的局限性，尤其在小样本场景下具有出色表现，展示了新的方向。

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个深度学习框架结合U-Net分割模型和分类模型，用于增强宫颈癌的诊断能力，并对分割对分类性能的影响进行了评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌是全球女性癌症相关死亡的主要原因之一，提高早期检测效率对降低死亡率非常重要。传统的手工检测方法费时且容易出错，因此需要借助自动化方法。

Method: 研究使用U-Net作为分割模型，并与分类模型结合，对Herlev Pap Smear公开数据集进行训练和评估。通过对比使用分割图像和非分割图像训练的模型来评估分割对分类性能的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，分割图像的使用对分类性能（精确度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%）的改进有限，但分割有助于特征提取。

Conclusion: 尽管分割对分类性能的影响有限，提出的方法可作为临床应用的补充工具，有助于病理学家进行早期诊断。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Conclusion: CMFDNet成功应对传统自动分割方法的多种限制，为结肠息肉分割任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP模型在预训练过程中的偏差如何向下游任务中传递，并探讨了偏差在下游任务中传播的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨CLIP模型在视觉语言任务中预训练学习的偏差是否会传递到下游任务，以及如何传递，这是因为这些偏差可能会影响视觉问答或图像描述等下游任务。

Method: 通过详细的实证分析，研究了偏差在预训练期间在数据中的表现方式，并分析了这些偏差在不同下游任务中的转移情况，尝试找出其中的不一致性原因。

Result: 发现偏差测量对选用的数据子集有高度依赖，不同预训练CLIP的表征空间在适应下游任务时趋于收敛，从而导致偏差在效应上的不一致性。

Conclusion: 当前偏差传递的表现复杂，不一致性可能是由于不同模型在调整后趋于收敛。研究为更好的偏差缓解实践提供了洞见。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RAD的鲁棒异常检测框架，能够在工业环境中处理含有标签噪声的训练数据，并表现出卓越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在处理含有标签噪声的训练数据时的显著挑战，特别是在工业环境中的异常检测应用中。

Method: 通过将Normalizing Flows与模型无关的元学习相结合，采用双层优化策略。元学习使模型能够快速适应变化的噪声条件，不确定性量化则引导自适应L2正则化以保持模型稳定性，同时利用预训练特征提取器和正常化流的优势来进行多尺度特征处理和精确的异常打分。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和KSDD2数据集上取得了优异表现，I-AUROC分别为95.4%和94.6%，在50%的训练样本带有噪声情况下，仍保持了86.8%和92.1%的检测能力。

Conclusion: RAD框架在工业场景中表现出对噪声训练条件的高度鲁棒性和检测微小异常的能力，是应对实际应用中数据未被完整整理挑战的一种实用方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了部分标注细胞分割的难题，并提供了易用的Napari插件，降低了使用门槛。

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

Conclusion: 所提方法简单有效，无需更改模型架构或额外训练，可直接改进视觉标记裁剪效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Result: 在四个基准数据集的实验中，UniSino表现出卓越的重建质量与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UniSino统一且高效地改善了CT成像伪影问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Conclusion: 所提框架通过视觉语义协作和时序建模显著提升了视频融合的视觉、语义和时序表现，具有先进性和优越性。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Meiqi-Gong/TemCoCo.

Conclusion: 框架无需依赖视觉语言对齐或模型集成，适合资源受限环境下的快速部署需求，具有很高的实用价值。

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Motivation: 解决隐蔽物体检测领域中像素级标注困难的问题，提高对未标注数据的利用效率。

Method: 提出了SCOUT框架，包含自适应数据增强与选择模块（ADAS）以及文本融合模块（TFM），并构建了新的RefTextCOD数据集。

Result: 实验表明，SCOUT方法在隐蔽物体检测任务中超越了现有半监督方法，达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: SCOUT通过结合数据选择和文本视觉交互，有效提升了隐蔽物体检测的性能，且有望进一步推广应用。

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at
https://github.com/Heartfirey/SCOUT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiffAug框架，通过文本指导的扩散生成与自动分割验证相结合，改善医学影像分割模型对罕见异常的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型由于缺乏带注释的病理数据，难以精确处理罕见异常情况。

Method: 使用基于文本引导的潜在扩散模型结合空间掩码生成病变，通过潜在空间分割网络进行动态质量验证。文本提示来源于医学文献，生成多样性病变且无需手动注释。

Result: 在三个医学影像基准下(CVC-ClinicDB、Kvasir-SEG、REFUGE2)，该框架取得比基线模型高8-10%的Dice提升，并将小病变（如小息肉和平坦病变）的漏检率降低了28%。

Conclusion: DiffAug框架显著改进了医学图像分割任务对罕见病变的处理能力，尤其在早期筛查领域具有重要意义。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases
like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ATLaS的方法，通过交替训练标准标签和软标签来改进prompt tuning的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的prompt tuning方法虽然高效，但其泛化能力有限。标签平滑（LS）被广泛认可为一种提高模型泛化能力的正则化技术，因此探讨与prompt tuning的结合。

Method: 提出交替训练的标签平滑方法（ATLaS），采用标准标签与软标签交替训练，并设计两种离线软标签（CSL和ISL）以提供类别间或实例间关系，增强prompt tuning。

Result: 实验结果表明，ATLaS结合CSL和ISL提升了prompt tuning的泛化性能，并与现有方法兼容性高。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效改进了prompt tuning的泛化能力，并且可无缝整合到其他方法中，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Result: 在公开数据集评估中，所提出方法达到了当前最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 本文的方法通过缓解伪标签的类不平衡以及提升伪标签准确性，为目标检测的盒级主动学习提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法VISA，通过分组选择和聚合视觉token来提升多模态大模型（MLLMs）的推理效率，同时保持视觉信息完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大模型推理中因视觉token过多导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 开发了一种基于图的视觉token聚合（VTA）模块，通过对语义相似度构建图，把被删除token的信息聚合到保留的token中；并设计了一种分组选择策略（GTS），通过分组逐渐聚合视觉信息来稳定提取过程。

Result: 实验表明，相较以往方法，VISA在保持模型性能和提升推理速度之间达到了更优的平衡效果。

Conclusion: VISA是一种有效的新方法，可同时优化MLLMs的推理速度和视觉信息保留。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多图像视觉问答往往存在视觉冗余问题，这些与问题回答无关的冗余信息会影响模型的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出了一种自适应视觉锚定方法，能够集成到现有的MLLM中，通过自适应压缩减少多图像中的视觉冗余。同时加入了一种新的协作解码机制，用于平衡全局和压缩视觉输入的结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个MLLM上都显示出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提高了MVQA任务中的准确性和效率，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种基于3D高斯投影的相机位姿优化框架GS-SMC，可以直接应用于各种场景，显著提升了位姿估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机位姿优化方法依赖2D-3D对应关系，需针对不同场景重建或重新训练，或通过特征相似性推断位姿但缺乏几何约束，精度不高。作者希望设计一个无需额外训练且精度更高的优化方法。

Method: 提出基于3D高斯投影的GS-SMC框架，通过渲染场景生成新视图，并利用查询图像与渲染图像间的对极几何约束进行迭代优化，同时可灵活选择特征提取与匹配策略。

Result: 在7-Scenes和Cambridge Landmarks数据集上的测试表明，提出的方法显著降低了位姿估计误差——在7-Scenes上平移误差降低53.3%，旋转误差减少56.9%；在Cambridge上分别减少40.7%和53.2%。

Conclusion: 本文方法无需额外训练或微调，轻量化且适用于多场景，明显优于现有的相机位姿优化方法。

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital
forensics.

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)

Motivation: 当前视频问答系统由于推理与感知解耦导致信息损失或计算效率低下，CAVIA旨在解决这一适应性问题。

Method: 提出了一种闭环的推理-感知协调框架CAVIA，包括层次推理引导帧定位、跨模态语义桥接和基于置信的迭代合成。

Result: CAVIA相比于现有方法在EgoSchema、NExT-QA及IntentQA基准数据集上分别提升了5.3%、2.6%和6.9%。

Conclusion: CAVIA通过推理引导的感知提取，成功展示了动态协调在视频理解中的潜力，为长视频问答提供了一种可扩展的解决策略。

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Method: 从TUM研究医院选取22名病例，使用Astra工具箱模拟3种梁几何并生成稀疏采样的CT数据。训练了2D和3D U-Nets并对不同维度的CT数据（包括2D、2.5D和3D）性能进行了对比分析。

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为SAIL-Recon的算法，可高效处理大规模场景，同时在相机位姿估计和新视图合成任务上取得了最新成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景回归方法虽然在极端视角变化下表现出色，但难以处理大量输入图像。

Method: 设计了一种具备视觉定位功能的场景回归网络SAIL-Recon，通过以锚点图像生成神经场景表示，然后对回归网络进行微调以重建所有输入图像。

Result: 实验表明SAIL-Recon在大规模场景中表现卓越，并在多项基准测试中取得了最先进成绩。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon成功解决了现有方法的扩展性问题，并为大规模SfM提供了一种高效的解决方案，代码和模型已开放访问。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are
publicly available at: https://hkust-sail.github.io/ sail-recon/.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了视觉异常检测（VAD）的应用，尤其是在医疗领域。研究关注模型性能随输入数据分布变化的影响，并引入了一种名为PatchCoreCL的方式来解决医疗场景中的持续学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于医疗成像数据动态变化的特点，研究提出结合持续学习（CL）和VAD，以在检测异常数据时保留已学知识，解决因数据分布变化引起的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 通过将PatchCore模型适配为持续学习版本PatchCoreCL，并在真实医疗影像数据集BMAD上进行了评估。

Result: PatchCoreCL表现优异，达到与任务专用模型相当的性能，遗忘率不到1%。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了在医疗影像中使用持续学习方法进行VAD的可行性和潜力，为该领域提供了新的方法和视角。

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Result: 当使用带漂移增强的道路图像测试时，检测准确性提高超过90%。

Conclusion: 这种混合模型能在混合结构中协同工作，为自动驾驶提供更好的道路安全保障。

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Conclusion: 方法通过多领域划分与跨领域知识整合，有效解决了数据中异常干扰问题，提升了全无监督异常检测性能。

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Result: 发现不同CAM方法对噪声有显著不同的敏感性。

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒性评估指标能够定量分析CAM的稳健性和敏感性特征。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Method: 通过使用多种生成模型（如CycleGANs，cGANs等）并调优生成器和判别器，用2D X光影像生成更逼真的颅骨与面部图像；评价生成质量使用了FID、IS和SSIM评分。

Conclusion: 2D X光影像被首次用于生成模型进行颅面重建，并提出了生成面部图像结合检索框架的方法，展示了对法医应用的有效性。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和VisCog-Bench等基准上分别获得15%、5%和19%的性能提升。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG在优化文本-图像生成的语义推理和过程改进方面表现优越，同时为未来研究提供了新基准和资源。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

Conclusion: 通过有效缓解偏差和减少遗忘，新方法显著提升了脑信号与视觉理解模型的表现。

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Motivation: 现有方法因浅层特征表达、推理机制不足及弱跨模态融合，难以深度理解复杂场景及精确分割目标。

Method: 引入ArgusCogito框架，包括三个阶段：猜测（全局推理与跨模态融合）、聚焦（注意力驱动的精准目标定位）、雕刻（通过密集提示生成高保真分割结果）。

Conclusion: ArgusCogito框架通过结合跨模态融合和全局推理，显著提升伪装目标分割的准确性及鲁棒性，有望成为领域新的方法基准。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Result: EventTracer能以720p每秒视频约4分钟的速度运行，在场景细节和与真实世界事件数据的相似性上超过了其他模拟器。

Conclusion: EventTracer可以高效生成大规模事件-RGB数据集，减少模拟与实际之间的差距，并促进机器人、自主驾驶与VR/AR等领域的应用。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种原型学习和聚类方法，用于在小样本环境下发现高光谱图像中的未知类别，与现有方法相比表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在开放集小样本高光谱图像分类中辨别已知类与未知类样本，但无法进一步发现未知类别。

Method: 论文提出一种原型学习和聚类方法，利用少量标记样本推断未知类原型，分类器将未知类样本拒绝后，进一步依据样本到推断原型的距离对其进行聚类。

Result: 该方法在四个基准数据集上的实验表现出竞争力，相较于现有最先进的方法更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在解决开放集小样本高光谱图像分类问题中具有出色表现，并可进一步探测和聚类未知类别。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Result: 发现了现有模型在视觉引导编辑任务中的显著性能差异，并展示了模型幻觉问题的存在。

Conclusion: SpotEdit 可成为未来研究中的综合工具，有助于揭示和解决视觉引导编辑中的潜在问题。

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域和其他领域中，像素级标注数据的获取成本高且容易出错，因此需要一种能够有效利用粗糙标注的解决方案。

Method: 使用两个耦合的卷积神经网络（CNN）从噪声粗标注中学习真实的分割标签分布；通过高保真度的噪声标注区分两网络，并提出了补充标签学习策略以鼓励负标签分布的估计。

Result: 在多个公开数据集（如Cityscapes和视网膜图像数据集）的实验中，提出的方法在粗标注数据比例远小于密集标注的情况下表现尤为优异，并超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了对高质量像素级标注的依赖，在医学影像和多类别分割任务中都有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Method: 用一种潜扩散模型结合推理时的指导优化物体重建，同时确保合理的手物体交互。通过引入多模态几何约束和优化设计，有效指导扩散模型的速度场，同时约束手和物体的变换。

Result: 实现了高精度、鲁棒性强、一致性高的重建效果，即使在遮挡或野外环境中也适用。

Conclusion: 本方法提供了一种创新且实用的手物体交互三维重建方案，提高了几何重建的质量和适用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为GM-Skip的框架，可通过跳过Transformer块提升视觉-语言模型（VLM）的推理速度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer-based VLM在推理任务中的高计算成本问题，满足对低时延需求的实际应用（如自动驾驶）。

Method: 提出GM-Skip框架，通过贪婪的指标引导块选择策略和逆序删除机制，在跳过冗余层的同时保持早期基础块以避免性能下降。可调节稀疏性与性能间的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，GM-Skip在多个任务和数据集上提高了推理速度并保持性能，如在COCO数据集提高某些分类准确率从19.1%到87.3%，且跳过40%以上的Transformer块。在真实部署中实现了较大时延缩减（如在自动驾驶中减少了45.4%的时延）。

Conclusion: GM-Skip高效地减少了推理延迟，提供了一种实用的方法来加速Transformer-based VLM的实际部署，同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

Conclusion: 定向去学习是一种可行的防御策略，为保护生成模型的安全提供了新的方向，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

Method: 提出LanSE架构，基于语言驱动稀疏编码器，识别可解释视觉模式并用自然语言描述，同时量化生成质量的四个维度。

Result: 通过超过11,000次人工评估和多模态模型分析，LanSE在自然图像上检测视觉模式的准确率超过93%，揭示一些现有指标无法发现的模型差异。

Conclusion: LanSE为生成式AI模型提供了强大的模型选择和质量控制工具，促进解释性评价并增强对AI生成内容的公众信任，为未来的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

Motivation: 当前的3D姿态估计模型往往依赖完整的几何先验或较高计算成本，难以在低资源环境中应用，因此需要研发既精确又高效的模型。

Conclusion: 新模型在提高精确度同时，大幅降低计算成本，兼顾多种应用场景，适合在嵌入式设备和低功耗环境中部署。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Conclusion: GSVisLoc能够以现成的3DGS表示实现高效视觉定位，并具备良好的泛化能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

TL;DR: InternVL 3.5是一种新型开源多模态模型，具备显著的通用性、推理能力与推断效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升多模态模型在推理能力、效率及实用性方面的表现，缩小与顶级商用模型（如GPT-5）的差距。

Method: 提出了Cascade强化学习框架，通过离线与在线两阶段策略实现高效推理；引入了视觉分辨率路由器（ViR）优化视觉编解码性能；采用分离视觉语言部署（DvD）策略均衡计算资源。

Conclusion: InternVL3.5在开放多模态任务中表现出色，缩小了与顶级商业模型的性能差距，且提供开源代码和模型支持研究社区。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ObjFiller-3D的新方法，用于高质量一致性的3D对象素材补全和编辑，避免了传统2D方法中多个视角带来的不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D补全方法依赖多视角2D图像技术，但往往会出现模糊纹理和视觉伪影等问题，难以满足高保真和结构完整的目标。

Method: 本方法利用视频修复模型适配3D场景修复，并引入参考型3D补全方法，以优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，ObjFiller-3D在各类数据集表现优异，PSNR提升至26.6（对比NeRFiller的15.9），LPIPS优化至0.19（对比Instant3dit的0.25）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D对象修复的效果，并具备实际部署潜力，为高质量3D编辑应用提供了可能性。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GreenTEA，一种自动优化大型语言模型(LLMs)提示词的工作流，能够在探索与利用之间取得平衡，并在多个基准任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前高质量的提示词设计需要大量的人工成本与专业知识，且现有方法的优化效率不高或效果有限，因此需要一种高效且性能优越的自动提示词优化方法。

Method: 提出了GreenTEA，利用团队代理模型和遗传算法进行提示词的优化迭代。通过分析错误样本提取常见错误模式并生成针对性地改进提示词，采用遗传算法中的自然选择、交叉、变异步骤逐步优化提示性能。

Result: 实验显示，GreenTEA在多个公开基准数据集上的表现优于手工设计的提示词以及现有的自动提示词优化方法。

Conclusion: GreenTEA能够有效提升LLMs的提示性能，具有较高的应用潜力，是当前提示词优化方法的显著进步。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve
exceptional performance. However, manually crafting effective prompts is
labor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its
scalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively
explore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to
inefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback
on existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex
prompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an
agentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate
exploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of
agents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An
analyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current
prompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to
directly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a
genetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving
candidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to
progressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of
GreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for
automatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,
commonsense, and ethical decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个认知决策路径(CDR)框架，以动态选择适当的推理策略，显著减少计算成本并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大模型在选择直觉反应与深入推理之间存在挑战，且通常使用固定或昂贵的方法进行推理。

Method: 基于双过程理论，设计了一个元认知层，从多个维度动态分析查询复杂性，以选择合理的推理方式。

Result: 实验中，该框架在减少34%的计算成本的同时性能优于传统方法，尤其在专家级任务中有23%的一致性提升和18%的准确性提高。

Conclusion: 将认知科学原则与AI系统设计结合，通过CDR框架实现动态自适应推理，在提升推理性能和效率上展示了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental challenge in deciding when to
rely on rapid, intuitive responses versus engaging in slower, more deliberate
reasoning. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory and his insights
on human cognitive biases, we propose a novel Cognitive Decision Routing (CDR)
framework that dynamically determines the appropriate reasoning strategy based
on query characteristics. Our approach addresses the current limitations where
models either apply uniform reasoning depth or rely on computationally
expensive methods for all queries. We introduce a meta-cognitive layer that
analyzes query complexity through multiple dimensions: correlation strength
between given information and required conclusions, domain boundary crossings,
stakeholder multiplicity, and uncertainty levels. Through extensive experiments
on diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CDR achieves superior
performance while reducing computational costs by 34\% compared to uniform deep
reasoning approaches. Our framework shows particular strength in professional
judgment tasks, achieving 23\% improvement in consistency and 18\% better
accuracy on expert-level evaluations. This work bridges cognitive science
principles with practical AI system design, offering a principled approach to
adaptive reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推理过程中使用更多的计算资源以提高大型语言模型的推理质量和任务表现。提出验证器方法来优化解码过程，寻找最佳输出。

Method: 分析和总结文献中多种验证器的训练方法、类型及其在TTS中的应用，并构建了一个公开存储库以收录相关研究内容。

Result: 提供了对于验证器训练机制以及应用在测试时扩展中的统一理解，同时整理总结了多种验证方式。

Conclusion: 验证器在提高TTS性能的过程中起到关键作用，且其训练方式和分类需要进一步的系统梳理。本研究填补了这一领域的空白。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the
performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more
computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning
process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as
distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding
search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that
help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently
explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm
commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free
scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be
prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify
process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no
detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse
verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover
the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier
training, types and their utility in test-time scaling. Our repository can be

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成推理轨迹是否需要对最终用户具备可解释性，并通过对模型进行微调研究其对任务表现的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在任务性能与推理轨迹的可解释性之间的权衡，特别是在开放书问题回答领域，探讨生成的推理轨迹是否需要对用户具备语义上的解释能力。

Method: 通过对LLaMA和Qwen模型微调，使用四种类型的推理轨迹进行实验，同时进行100名参与者的人类研究以评估推理轨迹的可解释性。

Result: 微调基于R1轨迹的模型性能最佳，但在可解释性评估中却评分最低，表现出性能与可解释性之间的显著不匹配。

Conclusion: 推理轨迹和用户可解释性的分离可能是有益的，并不总是需要牺牲性能来追求解释性。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate
intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in
DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision
signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit
assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and
interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for
semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT
reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}" We
investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by
supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:
(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)
LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically
generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between
interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with
100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results
reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest
performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.
These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from
end user interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出QueryBandits框架，用于通过语义特征引导LLMs输入查询重写，减少幻觉生成，比传统方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs常因高级推理能力导致幻觉问题恶化，现有工作多注重事后过滤，而非预防性设计查询。

Method: 设计QueryBandits多臂老虎机框架，基于17种语言特征的敏感性，通过查询重写策略，调整输入以减少幻觉倾向。

Result: 在13个QA基准和每个数据集1050个查询中，QueryBandits取得87.5%胜率，显著优于静态提示的重写策略。

Conclusion: 建议通过语义特征引导的查询重写，能有效减少LLMs幻觉生成，且比静态重写方法更灵活高效。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused
higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on
after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We
introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to
maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon
the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,
proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse
QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top
contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a
no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting
("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we
empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating
hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.
Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a
considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher
cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites
can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm
regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite
strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via
exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in
output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for
retraining or gradient-based adaptation.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出类似意识的行为，以及其在空间意识、目标导向行为等方面的能力。

Method: 使用迷宫测试，从第一人称视角考察模型的空间意识、目标导向行为等，同时结合13项意识特性对12个LLMs进行零样本、单样本和少样本环境下的测试。

Result: 具有推理能力的LLMs表现优于标准模型，其中Gemini 2.0 Pro的完整路径准确率为52.9%，DeepSeek-R1的部分路径准确率达80.5%。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在意识相关行为上取得进展，但其仍缺乏整合的、持续的自我意识。

Abstract: We investigate consciousness-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs)
using the Maze Test, challenging models to navigate mazes from a first-person
perspective. This test simultaneously probes spatial awareness,
perspective-taking, goal-directed behavior, and temporal sequencing-key
consciousness-associated characteristics. After synthesizing consciousness
theories into 13 essential characteristics, we evaluated 12 leading LLMs across
zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning scenarios. Results showed
reasoning-capable LLMs consistently outperforming standard versions, with
Gemini 2.0 Pro achieving 52.9% Complete Path Accuracy and DeepSeek-R1 reaching
80.5% Partial Path Accuracy. The gap between these metrics indicates LLMs
struggle to maintain coherent self-models throughout solutions -- a fundamental
consciousness aspect. While LLMs show progress in consciousness-related
behaviors through reasoning mechanisms, they lack the integrated, persistent
self-awareness characteristic of consciousness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过自知识蒸馏在稠密和稀疏表示间实现双向学习，解决了现有多模态检索方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多模态领域稀疏检索方法依靠高成本的对比预训练或稠密模型蒸馏，限制了两者的相互增强潜力，亟需更高效的改进方法。

Method: 通过集成相似性得分（稠密和稀疏相似性加权求和）作为共享教师信号，利用自知识蒸馏实现稠密和稀疏表示之间的双向学习，同时只微调稠密编码器和稀疏投影头。

Result: 在MSCOCO和Flickr30k数据集上，提出的稀疏检索方法不仅优于现有稀疏基线，还达到了甚至超越稠密模型的性能，同时保留了稀疏模型的优势。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了多模态领域中稀疏检索方法的性能，并为稠密和稀疏表示的统一学习提供了有效的方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance
on multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense
representations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction
in text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast
term-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent
work has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often
rely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation
from a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.
To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that
enables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations
through Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved
using an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse
similarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.
To ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the
sparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.
Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not
only outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance
comparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the
benefits of sparse models.

Motivation: 现有的Chain-of-thought (CoT)方法缺乏反思和纠错能力，可能导致模型持续犯错。

Method: ERP方法基于CoT，新增错误答案、错误识别和正确答案的步骤，使模型能够识别和纠正错误，并通过自动ERP生成实现过程扩展和可靠性。

Result: 实验证明，ERP能够有效补充传统CoT方法，提高模型的推理能力和解释性。

Conclusion: ERP方法提升了语言模型的推理性能和对路径错误的理解，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT),
present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These
methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct
procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks
the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to
perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for
said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance
reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of
an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process
enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to
incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid
and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with
automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be
integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in
the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement
to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable
reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models
ultimately reach their errors.

Motivation: 生成式AI快速扩展至高风险领域，但当前评估方法零散，缺乏标准化，阻碍了AI系统开发的可比性和效率。

Method: 开发GAICo，一个用于生成式AI输出比较的开源Python库，支持参考基础的多模态评估，具有高层API和可扩展架构。

Conclusion: GAICo通过简化和标准化评估，加速AI开发并提升系统可信度，有助于实现更快更安全的AI部署。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Generative AI (GenAI) into diverse, high-stakes
domains necessitates robust and reproducible evaluation methods. However,
practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common
metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g.,
automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g.,
text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI
system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI
Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and
standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible
framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for
unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images,
audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end
analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside
direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility
through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI
Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to
efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve
development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems,
aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment. Since its
release on PyPI in Jun 2025, the tool has been downloaded over 13K times,

Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLM重排序方法与轻量级方法在熟悉与未知查询上的性能差异，揭示导致差异的潜在因素。

Method: 通过对22种方法（40个变体）在包括TREC DL19, DL20, BEIR等数据集上的实验，系统分析训练数据重叠、模型架构和计算效率对重排序性能的影响。

Result: LLM方法在熟悉查询上的表现更为优越，但在新颖查询上的泛化能力存在差异。同时，轻量级模型在效率上具有一定竞争力。

Conclusion: 查询新颖性对重排序效果有显著影响，现有方法在应对新颖查询时的局限性亟待解决。

Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive empirical evaluation
of state-of-the-art reranking methods, encompassing large language model
(LLM)-based, lightweight contextual, and zero-shot approaches, with respect to
their performance in information retrieval tasks. We evaluate in total 22
methods, including 40 variants (depending on used LLM) across several
established benchmarks, including TREC DL19, DL20, and BEIR, as well as a novel
dataset designed to test queries unseen by pretrained models. Our primary goal
is to determine, through controlled and fair comparisons, whether a performance
disparity exists between LLM-based rerankers and their lightweight
counterparts, particularly on novel queries, and to elucidate the underlying
causes of any observed differences. To disentangle confounding factors, we
analyze the effects of training data overlap, model architecture, and
computational efficiency on reranking performance. Our findings indicate that
while LLM-based rerankers demonstrate superior performance on familiar queries,
their generalization ability to novel queries varies, with lightweight models
offering comparable efficiency. We further identify that the novelty of queries
significantly impacts reranking effectiveness, highlighting limitations in
existing approaches.

Motivation: 在多元文化背景下，确保VLMs的文化适应能力对于负责任的AI系统变得至关重要。

Method: 提出一种新的多模态框架，通过扰动文化身份与设计故事生成任务，评估5种现代VLMs的表现。

Result: 发现VLMs在文化适应方面表现出显著能力，但模型的文化适应性架构差异明显，有些模型甚至存在与文化身份的反向对齐问题。

Conclusion: 多模态AI在文化适应能力上展现潜力，但也面临显著挑战，提供了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve widespread deployment across diverse
cultural contexts, ensuring their cultural competence becomes critical for
responsible AI systems. While prior work has evaluated cultural awareness in
text-only models and VLM object recognition tasks, no research has
systematically assessed how VLMs adapt outputs when cultural identity cues are
embedded in both textual prompts and visual inputs during generative tasks. We
present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLM cultural competence through
multimodal story generation, developing a novel multimodal framework that
perturbs cultural identity and evaluates 5 contemporary VLMs on a downstream
task: story generation. Our analysis reveals significant cultural adaptation
capabilities, with rich culturally-specific vocabulary spanning names, familial
terms, and geographic markers. However, we uncover concerning limitations:
cultural competence varies dramatically across architectures, some models
exhibit inverse cultural alignment, and automated metrics show architectural
bias contradicting human assessments. Cross-modal evaluation shows that
culturally distinct outputs are indeed detectable through visual-semantic
similarity (28.7% within-nationality vs. 0.2% cross-nationality recall), yet
visual-cultural understanding remains limited. In essence, we establish the
promise and challenges of cultural competence in multimodal AI. We publicly

Motivation: 许多在线心理健康社区帖子由于缺乏明确的支持信号常常无人回复，研究旨在通过补充支持属性提升用户互动。

Method: 研究建立了一个名为MH-COPILOT的强化学习系统，整合了上下文属性识别、支持强度分类、受控问题生成与验证器建模，同时利用新数据集REDDME和分层分类法CueTaxo进行支持属性的识别与提示生成。

Result: 通过实验验证，模型显著提升了支持属性的补充效果及用户互动表现，并通过人工评估证明在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效改善在线心理健康社区的互动状况，实现支持属性的缺失补充，并受到实验验证支持。

Abstract: Online Mental Health Communities (OMHCs) provide crucial peer and expert
support, yet many posts remain unanswered due to missing support attributes
that signal the need for help. We present a novel framework that identifies
these gaps and prompts users to enrich their posts, thereby improving
engagement. To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts
from mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key
support attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,
and requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical
taxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.
Further, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that
integrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute
intensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical
taxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically
assesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates
targeted prompts to elicit missing information. Empirical results across four
notable language models demonstrate significant improvements in attribute
elicitation and user engagement. A human evaluation further validates the
model's effectiveness in real-world OMHC settings.

### [208] [ReProCon: Scalable and Resource-Efficient Few-Shot Biomedical Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16833)
*Jeongkyun Yoo,Nela Riddle,Andrew Hoblitzell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReProCon提出了一种新的少样本NER框架，通过多原型建模、余弦对比学习和Reptile元学习方法，解决生物医学领域中的数据稀缺与类别失衡问题，并在资源受限环境中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生物医学NER方法难以应对数据稀缺和不平衡标签分布问题，特别是在细粒度类别下。

Method: 提出ReProCon框架，通过多原型建模捕捉语义差异，采用余弦对比目标提升类别间分离度，利用Reptile元学习快速适应小数据集，且以轻量级的fastText + BiLSTM编码器实现。

Result: ReProCon在宏观$F_1$得分方面接近BERT基线表现（99%），在标签预算仅30%的情况下保持稳定，并从19类扩展到50类时，性能下降仅7.8%，优于SpanProto和CONTaiNER等基线模型。

Conclusion: ReProCon展示了在资源受限条件下，尤其是生物医学应用中的先进性能，强调了多原型建模和对比学习对于平衡类别的重要性，适合解决类别模糊性问题。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical domains faces challenges due to
data scarcity and imbalanced label distributions, especially with fine-grained
entity types. We propose ReProCon, a novel few-shot NER framework that combines
multi-prototype modeling, cosine-contrastive learning, and Reptile
meta-learning to tackle these issues. By representing each category with
multiple prototypes, ReProCon captures semantic variability, such as synonyms
and contextual differences, while a cosine-contrastive objective ensures strong
interclass separation. Reptile meta-updates enable quick adaptation with little
data. Using a lightweight fastText + BiLSTM encoder with much lower memory
usage, ReProCon achieves a macro-$F_1$ score close to BERT-based baselines
(around 99 percent of BERT performance). The model remains stable with a label
budget of 30 percent and only drops 7.8 percent in $F_1$ when expanding from 19
to 50 categories, outperforming baselines such as SpanProto and CONTaiNER,
which see 10 to 32 percent degradation in Few-NERD. Ablation studies highlight
the importance of multi-prototype modeling and contrastive learning in managing
class imbalance. Despite difficulties with label ambiguity, ReProCon
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in resource-limited settings, making
it suitable for biomedical applications.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了语言模型在语法结构上的幻觉现象，并通过行为探测和元语言探测任务揭示了这种问题与研究假设的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在研究大语言模型如何在语法结构中产生虚假的正假设并对其确认偏向进行分析。

Method: 分别通过行为探测任务（使用上下文嵌入）和元语言探测任务（使用提示）来区分语言模型的隐性与显性语言知识，并模拟假设测试进行验证。

Result: 两种探测方法均显示模型确实会产生幻觉构造，且模拟假设测试表明这些错误构造会因确认偏见被普遍验证。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的构造探测方法存在确认偏差，可能暗示其还存有其他未知且不正确的句法知识。

Abstract: This paper investigates false positive constructions: grammatical structures
which an LLM hallucinates as distinct constructions but which human
introspection does not support. Both a behavioural probing task using
contextual embeddings and a meta-linguistic probing task using prompts are
included, allowing us to distinguish between implicit and explicit linguistic
knowledge. Both methods reveal that models do indeed hallucinate constructions.
We then simulate hypothesis testing to determine what would have happened if a
linguist had falsely hypothesized that these hallucinated constructions do
exist. The high accuracy obtained shows that such false hypotheses would have
been overwhelmingly confirmed. This suggests that construction probing methods
suffer from a confirmation bias and raises the issue of what unknown and
incorrect syntactic knowledge these models also possess.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于无预设分解问句的框架，用于提高声明验证中的一致性与准确性，实现2-5%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 此前研究显示，生成的问题中存在的预设可能引入未经验证的假设，并导致声明验证中出现不一致性。同时，提示敏感性是大型语言模型的重大挑战，导致性能波动达3-6%。尽管已有进展缩小了这一差距，但提示敏感性依然是长期存在的问题。

Method: 提出一个有结构且稳健的声明验证框架，通过无预设的分解问句进行推理，减少生成问题中的预设和模型对提示的敏感性。

Result: 跨多个提示、数据集与大型语言模型的广泛实验表明，即使是最先进的模型，也依然容易受到提示变化和预设的影响。所提方法显著减少了这些问题，提升了验证性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效减轻了提示敏感性与预设带来的影响，为声明验证中的一致性和准确性做出了贡献，实现了2-5%的性能改进。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that presupposition in generated questions can introduce
unverified assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in claim verification.
Additionally, prompt sensitivity remains a significant challenge for large
language models (LLMs), resulting in performance variance as high as 3-6%.
While recent advancements have reduced this gap, our study demonstrates that
prompt sensitivity remains a persistent issue. To address this, we propose a
structured and robust claim verification framework that reasons through
presupposition-free, decomposed questions. Extensive experiments across
multiple prompts, datasets, and LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models
remain susceptible to prompt variance and presupposition. Our method
consistently mitigates these issues, achieving up to a 2-5% improvement.

Motivation: 为了解决在资源受限场景中大模型部署受到限制的问题，该研究探索了提升知识蒸馏效果以更有效捕捉教师模型推理的全面性的技术。

Method: 使用QR-Distill方法，包括：1）路径质量筛选，通过LLM评估保留正确路径；2）条件路由，根据学生当前学习状态动态分配路径；3）合作同伴教学，学生间相互蒸馏多样化的见解。

Result: 实验表明，QR-Distill优于传统的单路径和多路径蒸馏方法。进一步的消融研究验证了路径质量筛选、条件路由和同伴教学各组件在知识传递中的重要性。

Conclusion: QR-Distill是一种有效的方法，能够在不同学生间实现知识的高效传递，适用于推理能力增强的场景。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance reasoning
capabilities but their deployment is restricted in resource-constrained
scenarios. Knowledge distillation addresses this by transferring knowledge from
powerful teacher models to compact and transparent students. However,
effectively capturing the teacher's comprehensive reasoning is challenging due
to conventional token-level supervision's limited scope. Using multiple
reasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path
identically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability
across tasks and models. We propose Quality-filtered Routing with Cooperative
Distillation (QR-Distill), combining path quality filtering, conditional
routing, and cooperative peer teaching. First, quality filtering retains only
correct reasoning paths scored by an LLM-based evaluation. Second, conditional
routing dynamically assigns paths tailored to each student's current learning
state. Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill
diverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific
reasoning styles. Experiments demonstrate QR-Distill's superiority over
traditional single- and multi-path distillation methods. Ablation studies
further highlight the importance of each component including quality filtering,
conditional routing, and peer teaching in effective knowledge transfer. Our
code is available at https://github.com/LzyFischer/Distill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型对语言学知识内化的理解，提供跨语言的句法评估基准。

Method: 提出了QFrCoLA数据集，并结合其他七个语料库测试了七种语言模型的表现。

Result: 微调后的Transformer语言模型在多数任务中表现出色，尤其是QFrCoLA基准；跨语言预训练模型对魁北克法语的语言判断能力有限。

Conclusion: QFrCoLA数据集具有挑战性，可用来评估语言模型的语言判断能力，并反映语法规范。

Abstract: Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these
models internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have
recently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models
across languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of
Linguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments
dataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our
study leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary
acceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results
demonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong
baselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large
language models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,
on average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods
tested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our
experimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities
during their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on
QFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic
norms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability
judgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic
judgment capabilities.

Motivation: 针对特定领域（例如法律）的文本简化需求，开发能够准确评估简化后文本是否保持原意的工具和指标。

Method: 提出了一个新数据集（FrJUDGE），用于评估法律文本间的意义保留，设计了一种新指标（JUDGEBERT），以更好地评估文本简化中的法律意义保留，并进行了人类判断一致性和与其他指标的比较实验以及可靠性验证。

Result: JUDGEBERT相比现有指标在人类判断一致性上表现更优，并在两个关键的可靠性检查中表现出色（对相同句子返回100%、对无关句子返回0%）。

Conclusion: JUDGEBERT具有潜力改善法律文本简化任务的准确性和可访问性，为法律从业者和普通用户提供便利。

Abstract: Simplifying text while preserving its meaning is a complex yet essential
task, especially in sensitive domain applications like legal texts. When
applied to a specialized field, like the legal domain, preservation differs
significantly from its role in regular texts. This paper introduces FrJUDGE, a
new dataset to assess legal meaning preservation between two legal texts. It
also introduces JUDGEBERT, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess legal
meaning preservation in French legal text simplification. JUDGEBERT
demonstrates a superior correlation with human judgment compared to existing
metrics. It also passes two crucial sanity checks, while other metrics did not:
For two identical sentences, it always returns a score of 100%; on the other
hand, it returns 0% for two unrelated sentences. Our findings highlight its
potential to transform legal NLP applications, ensuring accuracy and
accessibility for text simplification for legal practitioners and lay users.

Motivation: 目前世界模型在自然语言处理中的应用较少，作者的目标是通过构建对话世界模型来提升对话系统的性能。

Method: 定义一个POMDP，将情绪、情感和意图建模为用户信念，基于信息瓶颈最大化进行求解，并在此基础上结合基于模型的强化学习框架创建DreamCUB。

Result: 实验表明，其模型在情绪分类和情感识别上达到了SOTA性能，并通过联合训练提高了对话质量，同时在领域外场景如情感对话中具有良好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: 对话世界模型的预训练与强化学习结合可以显著提高对话系统的表现，并在探索与利用的平衡间找到合理方案，具备跨领域迁移能力。

Abstract: World models have been widely utilized in robotics, gaming, and auto-driving.
However, their applications on natural language tasks are relatively limited.
In this paper, we construct the dialogue world model, which could predict the
user's emotion, sentiment, and intention, and future utterances. By defining a
POMDP, we argue emotion, sentiment and intention can be modeled as the user
belief and solved by maximizing the information bottleneck. By this user belief
modeling, we apply the model-based reinforcement learning framework to the
dialogue system, and propose a framework called DreamCUB. Experiments show that
the pretrained dialogue world model can achieve state-of-the-art performances
on emotion classification and sentiment identification, while dialogue quality
is also enhanced by joint training of the policy, critic and dialogue world
model. Further analysis shows that this manner holds a reasonable
exploration-exploitation balance and also transfers well to out-of-domain
scenarios such as empathetic dialogues.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为OBJEX(MT)的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）作为其他模型的评估者能否准确提取会话目标，并测试其信心水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章的动机在于解决LLMs在评估多轮对抗性会话中，是否能准确推断会话的隐含目标的问题。

Method: 提出OBJEX(MT)基准，通过对对话转录进行目标提取和信心报告，使用校准的语义相似性计算准确性，并通过ECE、Brier分数等多种方式评估模型的元认知能力。

Result: 在四个数据集上测试了不同LLMs的性能，发现Claude-sonnet-4在目标提取准确性和校准方面表现最佳，而其他模型表现出过度自信且推断准确率较低。此外，不同数据集上的性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LLMs作为评估者在多轮对抗性会话中经常高置信度地错误推断目标，建议在操作时明确目标，并通过选择性预测或中止来管理风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as judges of other models,
yet it is unclear whether a judge can reliably infer the latent objective of
the conversation it evaluates, especially when the goal is distributed across
noisy, adversarial, multi-turn jailbreaks. We introduce OBJEX(MT), a benchmark
that requires a model to (i) distill a transcript into a single-sentence base
objective and (ii) report its own confidence. Accuracy is scored by an LLM
judge using semantic similarity between extracted and gold objectives;
correctness uses a single human-aligned threshold calibrated once on N=100
items (tau* = 0.61); and metacognition is evaluated with ECE, Brier score,
Wrong@High-Conf, and risk-coverage curves. We evaluate gpt-4.1,
claude-sonnet-4, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 on SafeMT Attack_600, SafeMTData_1K,
MHJ, and CoSafe. claude-sonnet-4 attains the highest objective-extraction
accuracy (0.515) and the best calibration (ECE 0.296; Brier 0.324), while
gpt-4.1 and Qwen3 tie at 0.441 accuracy yet show marked overconfidence (mean
confidence approx. 0.88 vs. accuracy approx. 0.44; Wrong@0.90 approx. 48-52%).
Performance varies sharply across datasets (approx. 0.167-0.865), with MHJ
comparatively easy and Attack_600/CoSafe harder. These results indicate that
LLM judges often misinfer objectives with high confidence in multi-turn
jailbreaks and suggest operational guidance: provide judges with explicit
objectives when possible and use selective prediction or abstention to manage
risk. We release prompts, scoring templates, and complete logs to facilitate
replication and analysis.

Motivation: 目前的大语言模型在需要深度推理和整合外部知识的任务中表现有限，现有方法如RAG和CoT未能充分解决其内部偏差问题。

Method: 提出一种条件性因果提示框架CFD-Prompting，通过构建反事实外部知识，模拟查询在不同上下文中的表现，实现对因果效应的无偏估计，同时缓解模型的内部偏差。

Result: 在多个LLMs和基准数据集上的实验表明，CFD-Prompting在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CFD-Prompting在弱假设条件下增强了推理过程的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为解决知识密集型任务中的推理问题提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural
language processing but still struggle to perform well on knowledge-intensive
tasks that require deep reasoning and the integration of external knowledge.
Although methods such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been proposed to enhance LLMs with external
knowledge, they still suffer from internal bias in LLMs, which often leads to
incorrect answers. In this paper, we propose a novel causal prompting
framework, Conditional Front-Door Prompting (CFD-Prompting), which enables the
unbiased estimation of the causal effect between the query and the answer,
conditional on external knowledge, while mitigating internal bias. By
constructing counterfactual external knowledge, our framework simulates how the
query behaves under varying contexts, addressing the challenge that the query
is fixed and is not amenable to direct causal intervention. Compared to the
standard front-door adjustment, the conditional variant operates under weaker
assumptions, enhancing both robustness and generalisability of the reasoning
process. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CFD-Prompting significantly outperforms existing baselines in
both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: 情感幻觉是一个重要的安全问题。该研究提供了有效资源来开发心理安全的大型语言模型。相关工具和数据集公开可用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive
interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine
relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the
production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social
presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically
diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500
mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,
evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,
and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance
preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment
with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model
families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective
hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance.
Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures
affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This
work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and
provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually
reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible
via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for
fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench.

Motivation: 解决预训练语言模型作为黑盒模型带来的可信度问题，通过探测其理解隐含知识的能力提升模型的解释性。

Method: 提出KnowProb方法，以六种潜在解释探测模型对文本隐藏知识的理解能力，包含基于知识的理解和基于联想的推理，具备后验解释能力。

Result: 实验验证了现有大规模或小规模的PLMs在捕获文本隐藏知识方面存在显著挑战，同时也表明KnowProb对识别黑盒模型局限性有效。

Conclusion: KnowProb方法能够多角度探测黑盒模型的局限性，为研究人员提升模型解释性提供了便捷工具。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled
data, yet they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the
trustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become
increasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper
proposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a
post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand
implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the
surface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations
derived from the underlying content of the given text, including three
knowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In
experiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only
learn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant
challenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the
limitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,
which facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box
models in an explainable way.

Motivation: 旨在探索AI对齐问题背后的价值选择与数据问题如何被理解和实践，而非仅局限于其技术层面。

Method: 通过审查与调查5家主要技术组织发布的6个LLM开发相关的公开文档，分析它们的价值设定和数据中心化特性。

Result: 详细记录了每个开发方案的对齐方法与审查结果，总结相关发现及其共同点，讨论相关的广泛社会技术问题。

Conclusion: AI对齐的实践不仅涉及技术挑战，同时还需要在价值选择和数据使用方面克服多样化的社会技术障碍。

Abstract: AI Alignment, primarily in the form of Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF), has been a cornerstone of the post-training phase in
developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It has also been a popular research
topic across various disciplines beyond Computer Science, including Philosophy
and Law, among others, highlighting the socio-technical challenges involved.
Nonetheless, except for the computational techniques related to alignment,
there has been limited focus on the broader picture: the scope of these
processes, which primarily rely on the selected objectives (values), and the
data collected and used to imprint such objectives into the models. This work
aims to reveal how alignment is understood and applied in practice from a
value-setting and data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we investigate
and survey (`audit') publicly available documentation released by 6 LLM
development initiatives by 5 leading organizations shaping this technology,
focusing on proprietary (OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini) and
open-weight (Meta's Llama, Google's Gemma, and Alibaba's Qwen) initiatives, all
published in the last 3 years. The findings are documented in detail per
initiative, while there is also an overall summary concerning different
aspects, mainly from a value-setting and data-centric perspective. On the basis
of our findings, we discuss a series of broader related concerns.

Abstract: Knowledge gaps and hallucinations are persistent challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), which generate unreliable responses when lacking the
necessary information to fulfill user instructions. Existing approaches, such
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these
issues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models
or services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and
often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge
without depending on retrievers or auxiliary models. Our approach uses
constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external
knowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows
only sequences of tokens that form an existing fact. We evaluate our proposal
on Question Answering and show that it scales to large knowledge bases (800
million facts), adapts to domain-specific data, and achieves effective results.
These gains come with minimal generation-time overhead. ReFactX code is

Motivation: 当前评估忽视了RAG系统在真实场景中的结构复杂性及多步推理需求。

Method: 通过构建一个合成的多跳问答数据集，综合考虑推理步数和语义距离，从生成器和检索器两侧评价任务难度。

Result: 实验证明错误率与任务难度的度量高度相关，验证了框架的诊断效用。

Conclusion: GRADE框架可用于细粒度分析RAG表现，并为真实世界应用中的多步推理改进提供基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are widely adopted in
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, but current evaluations often overlook the
structural complexity and multi-step reasoning required in real-world
scenarios. These benchmarks overlook key factors such as the interaction
between retrieval difficulty and reasoning depth. To address this gap, we
propose \textsc{GRADE}, a novel evaluation framework that models task
difficulty along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) reasoning depth, defined by the
number of inference steps (hops), and (2) semantic distance between the query
and its supporting evidence. We construct a synthetic multi-hop QA dataset from
factual news articles by extracting knowledge graphs and augmenting them
through semantic clustering to recover missing links, allowing us to generate
diverse and difficulty-controlled queries. Central to our framework is a 2D
difficulty matrix that combines generator-side and retriever-side difficulty.
Experiments across multiple domains and models show that error rates strongly
correlate with our difficulty measures, validating their diagnostic utility.
\textsc{GRADE} enables fine-grained analysis of RAG performance and provides a
scalable foundation for evaluating and improving multi-hop reasoning in
real-world applications.

*Abdelrahman Abdallah,Jamshid Mozafari,Bhawna Piryani,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双阶段框架DeAR用于文档重排序，达到了领先的准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单一模型难以兼顾细粒度相关性评分和跨文档分析，需要一种新的方法解决这一平衡问题。

Method: 通过第一阶段蒸馏来自LLaMA的相关性信号并训练一个紧凑模型，实现点对点评分；第二阶段通过额外微调让模型具备列表推理能力和自然语言解释能力。

Result: 在TREC-DL19/20、八个BEIR数据集和开放域QA等评估中，DeAR表现优异，超越多项开源基线和GPT-4的性能。

Conclusion: DeAR证明了双阶段方法的有效性，兼具高准确性和解释性，对现代重排系统有实际助益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed listwise document reranking by
enabling global reasoning over candidate sets, yet single models often struggle
to balance fine-grained relevance scoring with holistic cross-document
analysis. We propose \textbf{De}ep\textbf{A}gent\textbf{R}ank (\textbf{\DeAR}),
an open-source framework that decouples these tasks through a dual-stage
approach, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability. In \emph{Stage 1},
we distill token-level relevance signals from a frozen 13B LLaMA teacher into a
compact \{3, 8\}B student model using a hybrid of cross-entropy, RankNet, and
KL divergence losses, ensuring robust pointwise scoring. In \emph{Stage 2}, we
attach a second LoRA adapter and fine-tune on 20K GPT-4o-generated
chain-of-thought permutations, enabling listwise reasoning with
natural-language justifications. Evaluated on TREC-DL19/20, eight BEIR
datasets, and NovelEval-2306, \DeAR surpasses open-source baselines by +5.1
nDCG@5 on DL20 and achieves 90.97 nDCG@10 on NovelEval, outperforming GPT-4 by
+3.09. Without fine-tuning on Wikipedia, DeAR also excels in open-domain QA,
achieving 54.29 Top-1 accuracy on Natural Questions, surpassing baselines like
MonoT5, UPR, and RankGPT. Ablations confirm that dual-loss distillation ensures
stable calibration, making \DeAR a highly effective and interpretable solution
for modern reranking systems.\footnote{Dataset and code available at

*Jason R Brown,Lennie Wells,Edward James Young,Sergio Bacallado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KLQ的新方法，与PPO在特定意义上等价，并在语言生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO虽然在实践中表现良好，但其理论动机较为经验性，且在处理KL约束时方式随意，需要更有理论基础的方法。

Method: 提出KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ)方法，并证明其在某种特定意义上等价于PPO。

Result: 通过在总结与单轮对话任务上的基准测试，证实KLQ能够与PPO相当，且在LLM-as-a-judge评价中胜率更高。

Conclusion: KLQ作为一种有效的动作值RL方法，与PPO相当甚至更优，验证了其应用于LM-RLHF的潜力。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is an established and effective policy
gradient algorithm used for Language Model Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (LM-RLHF). PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic
motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an
ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we develop a a new action-value RL method for the
LM-RLHF setting, KL-regularised Q-Learning (KLQ). We then show that our method
is equivalent to a version of PPO in a certain specific sense, despite its very
different motivation. Finally, we benchmark KLQ on two key language generation
tasks -- summarisation and single-turn dialogue. We demonstrate that KLQ
performs on-par with PPO at optimising the LM-RLHF objective, and achieves a
consistently higher win-rate against PPO on LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行高效表格理解的方法，并在WikiTableQuestions和TabFact数据集上取得了先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于Chain-of-Thought和问题分解的方法在处理复杂的表格问题时缺乏长期计划能力和步骤间的紧密关联。

Method: 提出利用大型语言模型的长期计划能力，在表格分析中进行紧密关联的步骤设计，强化对复杂问题的解决效果，同时减少中间过程中的不必要细节。

Result: 实验证明该方法相比于现有强基线方法表现更加优异，并取得了WikiTableQuestions和TabFact数据集上的最佳成绩。

Conclusion: 通过结合大型语言模型的长期计划能力，可以显著提升表格理解效率和性能，为复杂问题提供更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Table understanding is key to addressing challenging downstream tasks such as
table-based question answering and fact verification. Recent works have focused
on leveraging Chain-of-Thought and question decomposition to solve complex
questions requiring multiple operations on tables. However, these methods often
suffer from a lack of explicit long-term planning and weak inter-step
connections, leading to miss constraints within questions. In this paper, we
propose leveraging the long-term planning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to enhance table understanding. Our approach enables the execution of a
long-term plan, where the steps are tightly interconnected and serve the
ultimate goal, an aspect that methods based on Chain-of-Thought and question
decomposition lack. In addition, our method effectively minimizes the inclusion
of unnecessary details in the process of solving the next short-term goals, a
limitation of methods based on Chain-of-Thought. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets.

TL;DR: EduRABSA项目开发了首个针对教育领域的公共ABSA注释数据集和一个简化数据标注的工具，用于提升学生文本反馈分析的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前教育领域的学生反馈文本复杂且细粒度低，缺乏有效的自动化意见挖掘方法，而现有ABSA研究主要集中于商业领域，缺乏教育领域的公共数据集和研究资源。

Method: 该研究开发了EduRABSA数据集，涵盖课程、教学人员和大学三种主题的ABSA任务，并特别处理隐含方面和隐含意见的提取。同时，设计了ASQE-DPT数据标注工具，简化了多任务ABSA数据标注过程。

Result: EduRABSA数据集和ASQE-DPT工具成功填补了教育领域ABSA研究的空白，促进了数据集的公开分享与科研透明化。

Conclusion: EduRABSA数据集和ASQE-DPT工具为教育领域ABSA研究和资源构建提供了新的支持，具有重要意义。

Abstract: Every year, most educational institutions seek and receive an enormous volume
of text feedback from students on courses, teaching, and overall experience.
Yet, turning this raw feedback into useful insights is far from
straightforward. It has been a long-standing challenge to adopt automatic
opinion mining solutions for such education review text data due to the content
complexity and low-granularity reporting requirements. Aspect-based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA) offers a promising solution with its rich, sub-sentence-level
opinion mining capabilities. However, existing ABSA research and resources are
very heavily focused on the commercial domain. In education, they are scarce
and hard to develop due to limited public datasets and strict data protection.
A high-quality, annotated dataset is urgently needed to advance research in
this under-resourced area. In this work, we present EduRABSA (Education Review
ABSA), the first public, annotated ABSA education review dataset that covers
three review subject types (course, teaching staff, university) in the English
language and all main ABSA tasks, including the under-explored implicit aspect
and implicit opinion extraction. We also share ASQE-DPT (Data Processing Tool),
an offline, lightweight, installation-free manual data annotation tool that
generates labelled datasets for comprehensive ABSA tasks from a single-task
annotation. Together, these resources contribute to the ABSA community and
education domain by removing the dataset barrier, supporting research
transparency and reproducibility, and enabling the creation and sharing of
further resources. The dataset, annotation tool, and scripts and statistics for
dataset processing and sampling are available at

Motivation: 现有方法难以应对表格内容的不可预测性和缺乏上下文信息的问题，从而限制大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种实体为导向的搜索方法和图形查询语言，以更好地利用语义相似性及表格单元之间的隐含关系，减少预处理和关键词匹配的需求。

Result: 方法在WikiTableQuestions和TabFact基准测试中实现了新的最先进性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过实体为导向的方法和图形查询语言，可以有效提升表格数据的语义理解及上下文关联。

Abstract: Our work addresses the challenges of understanding tables. Existing methods
often struggle with the unpredictable nature of table content, leading to a
reliance on preprocessing and keyword matching. They also face limitations due
to the lack of contextual information, which complicates the reasoning
processes of large language models (LLMs). To overcome these challenges, we
introduce an entity-oriented search method to improve table understanding with
LLMs. This approach effectively leverages the semantic similarities between
questions and table data, as well as the implicit relationships between table
cells, minimizing the need for data preprocessing and keyword matching.
Additionally, it focuses on table entities, ensuring that table cells are
semantically tightly bound, thereby enhancing contextual clarity. Furthermore,
we pioneer the use of a graph query language for table understanding,
establishing a new research direction. Experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on standard benchmarks
WikiTableQuestions and TabFact.

Result: 与基准数据集比较，使用GRAID增强后显著提高护栏模型性能。

Conclusion: GRAID能够有效扩展输入空间覆盖面，探索有害内容，提高对有害文本分类的性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of data scarcity in harmful text classification for
guardrailing applications and introduce GRAID (Geometric and Reflective
AI-Driven Data Augmentation), a novel pipeline that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for dataset augmentation. GRAID consists of two stages: (i)
generation of geometrically controlled examples using a constrained LLM, and
(ii) augmentation through a multi-agentic reflective process that promotes
stylistic diversity and uncovers edge cases. This combination enables both
reliable coverage of the input space and nuanced exploration of harmful
content. Using two benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that augmenting a
harmful text classification dataset with GRAID leads to significant
improvements in downstream guardrail model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言模型性能有限，现有方法代价高昂，本文旨在寻找高效的数据利用方式来提升跨语言表现。

Method: 提出了一种基于语言桥接的方法BridgeX-ICL，利用共享神经元，通过MUSE双语词典构建神经元探测数据，同时提出基于HSIC的指标来量化内部语言光谱并优化桥接选择。

Result: 实验证明BridgeX-ICL在2个跨语言任务和15组来自7个不同语言家族的语言对上均表现出有效性，涵盖高低资源和中低资源语言对。

Conclusion: BridgeX-ICL方法有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言学习能力，并揭示了LLMs多语言机制的实证见解。

Abstract: The current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in
improving performance on low-resource languages and urgently need
data-efficient methods without costly fine-tuning. From the perspective of
language-bridge, we propose BridgeX-ICL, a simple yet effective method to
improve zero-shot Cross-lingual In-Context Learning (X-ICL) for low-resource
languages. Unlike existing works focusing on language-specific neurons,
BridgeX-ICL explores whether sharing neurons can improve cross-lingual
performance in LLMs or not. We construct neuron probe data from the
ground-truth MUSE bilingual dictionaries, and define a subset of language
overlap neurons accordingly, to ensure full activation of these anchored
neurons. Subsequently, we propose an HSIC-based metric to quantify LLMs'
internal linguistic spectrum based on overlap neurons, which guides optimal
bridge selection. The experiments conducted on 2 cross-lingual tasks and 15
language pairs from 7 diverse families (covering both high-low and moderate-low
pairs) validate the effectiveness of BridgeX-ICL and offer empirical insights
into the underlying multilingual mechanisms of LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型中令牌表示在各层逐渐趋于一致的现象（均质化），以及这种现象是否与位置偏差有关。

Method: 通过层级相似性分析和对照实验，分析令牌在处理过程中的独特性变化，并测试位置偏差对均质化的影响。

Result: 发现令牌在处理过程中会系统性地失去独特性，尤其是在极端位置偏差的情况下。此外，实验证实均质化现象存在，并且依赖于位置注意机制。

Conclusion: 令牌均质化现象真实存在，且与位置注意机制息息相关。

Abstract: This paper investigates token homogenization - the convergence of token
representations toward uniformity across transformer layers and its
relationship to positional bias in large language models. We empirically
examine whether homogenization occurs and how positional bias amplifies this
effect. Through layer-wise similarity analysis and controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that tokens systematically lose distinctiveness during processing,
particularly when biased toward extremal positions. Our findings confirm both
the existence of homogenization and its dependence on positional attention
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在识别句子之间的关系时，要么难以提供显性语义标签，要么缺乏对上下文相关性的捕捉能力。

Method: 首先通过注意力分数聚合确定与目标句相关的候选句，然后利用预训练的NLI模型对候选句进行语义关系分类，并结合注意力机制的显著性分数过滤候选关系。

Result: 该方法能高效筛选出文本中与目标句相关的最重要的语义关系，如前提或矛盾关系。

Conclusion: 新方法整合了注意力机制和NLI模型的优点，有助于更精确地识别和分析文本复杂的语义关系。

Abstract: Finding the relationships between sentences in a document is crucial for
tasks like fact-checking, argument mining, and text summarization. A key
challenge is to identify which sentences act as premises or contradictions for
a specific claim. Existing methods often face a trade-off: transformer
attention mechanisms can identify salient textual connections but lack explicit
semantic labels, while Natural Language Inference (NLI) models can classify
relationships between sentence pairs but operate independently of contextual
saliency. In this work, we introduce a method that combines the strengths of
both approaches for a targeted analysis. Our pipeline first identifies
candidate sentences that are contextually relevant to a user-selected target
sentence by aggregating token-level attention scores. It then uses a pretrained
NLI model to classify each candidate as a premise (entailment) or
contradiction. By filtering NLI-identified relationships with attention-based
saliency scores, our method efficiently isolates the most significant semantic
relationships for any given claim in a text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确标题框架如何影响用户的信息搜索和决策过程。

Method: 通过控制实验，参与者在使用特定语言框架精心筛选的标题后提交查询，并选取其中的标题。

Result: 发现标题框架会显著影响后续查询行为：冲突和策略框架会扰乱用户与之前选择的匹配性，而情节框架会导致更具体的查询。此外，还观察到短期框架效应的延续性会随着时间有所减弱。

Conclusion: 即使是短暂的框架暴露，也可能对用户的信息搜索行为方向产生有意义的改变。

Abstract: Search engines play a central role in how people gather information, but
subtle cues like headline framing may influence not only what users believe but
also how they search. While framing effects on judgment are well documented,
their impact on subsequent search behavior is less understood. We conducted a
controlled experiment where participants issued queries and selected from
headlines filtered by specific linguistic frames. Headline framing
significantly shaped follow-up queries: conflict and strategy frames disrupted
alignment with prior selections, while episodic frames led to more concrete
queries than thematic ones. We also observed modest short-term frame
persistence that declined over time. These results suggest that even brief
exposure to framing can meaningfully alter the direction of users
information-seeking behavior.

Conclusion: 结合地理位置信息的自监督语种识别方法能有效处理方言和口音的多样性，提高模型性能。

Abstract: While Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has significantly improved Spoken
Language Identification (LID), existing models often struggle to consistently
classify dialects and accents of the same language as a unified class. To
address this challenge, we propose geolocation-aware LID, a novel approach that
incorporates language-level geolocation information into the SSL-based LID
model. Specifically, we introduce geolocation prediction as an auxiliary task
and inject the predicted vectors into intermediate representations as
conditioning signals. This explicit conditioning encourages the model to learn
more unified representations for dialectal and accented variations. Experiments
across six multilingual datasets demonstrate that our approach improves
robustness to intra-language variations and unseen domains, achieving new
state-of-the-art accuracy on FLEURS (97.7%) and 9.7% relative improvement on
ML-SUPERB 2.0 dialect set.

Result: 发现不同计算复杂性类别和语法结构对TLMs学习规则的能力存在显著影响。

Conclusion: 评估了TLMs在变复杂度和语法结构下的表现，为改进其推理能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of
reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent
years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be
reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of
view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect
TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of
satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational
complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are
expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language
satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.
Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational
complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'
ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,
we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言评估结果易被语言种类、实验设置及模型选择等因素混淆，难以获取真实性能。

Method: 通过引入三个可解释指标（表现实现比率、变异系数、语言潜力）及案例研究进行性能及语言差异分析。

Result: 提出的框架在13种模型和11个多语言数据集上显示更可靠的性能与语言差异度量，特别是低资源语言评估方面。

Conclusion: 更高的模型整体性能未必意味着对多语言的公平性提升，框架提供更细粒度的洞察。

Abstract: Results reported in large-scale multilingual evaluations are often fragmented
and confounded by factors such as target languages, differences in experimental
setups, and model choices. We propose a framework that disentangles these
confounding variables and introduces three interpretable metrics--the
performance realisation ratio, its coefficient of variation, and language
potential--enabling a finer-grained and more insightful quantification of
actual performance disparities across both (i) models and (ii) languages.
Through a case study of 13 model variants on 11 multilingual datasets, we
demonstrate that our framework provides a more reliable measurement of model
performance and language disparities, particularly for low-resource languages,
which have so far proven challenging to evaluate. Importantly, our results
reveal that higher overall model performance does not necessarily imply greater
fairness across languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究意图在于检验LLMs在强到弱的数据观点主义光谱中，基于注释者角色对仇恨言论进行标注的有效性。

Method: 通过将LLM生成的标注与现有注释者建模技术进行比较，并分析在数据观点主义范式下不同数据条件下的表现。

Result: LLMs在数据观点主义范式下，尽管在主观性提示下表现出一定的聚合性，但在强观点主义条件下，其性能接近人类注释者，但并未超越。

Conclusion: LLMs可以有效利用注释者特征，表现出一定程度的原型化，但其在更个性化的强观点主义数据集上的表现尚未优于人类注释者。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
annotate hate speech and abusiveness while considering predefined annotator
personas within the strong-to-weak data perspectivism spectra. We evaluated
LLM-generated annotations against existing annotator modeling techniques for
perspective modeling. Our findings show that LLMs selectively use demographic
attributes from the personas. We identified prototypical annotators, with
persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human
annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling
techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed
better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism
and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation
despite subjective prompting. However, for more personalized datasets tailored
to strong perspectivism, the performance of LLM annotator modeling approached,
but did not exceed, human annotators.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is a pivotal technique for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human intentions, safety constraints, and domain-specific
requirements. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the full
pipeline, encompassing (i) data collection methodologies, (ii) full-parameter
and parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, and (iii) evaluation protocols.
We categorized data construction into three major paradigms: expert annotation,
distillation from larger models, and self-improvement mechanisms, each offering
distinct trade-offs between quality, scalability, and resource cost.
Fine-tuning techniques range from conventional supervised training to
lightweight approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and prefix tuning,
with a focus on computational efficiency and model reusability. We further
examine the challenges of evaluating faithfulness, utility, and safety across
multilingual and multimodal scenarios, highlighting the emergence of
domain-specific benchmarks in healthcare, legal, and financial applications.
Finally, we discuss promising directions for automated data generation,
adaptive optimization, and robust evaluation frameworks, arguing that a closer
integration of data, algorithms, and human feedback is essential for advancing
instruction-tuned LLMs. This survey aims to serve as a practical reference for
researchers and practitioners seeking to design LLMs that are both effective
and reliably aligned with human intentions.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在专业领域知识匮乏的问题，特别是在药物发现和罕见疾病研究中的应用。

Method: 设计PU-ADKA框架，以预算为约束，动态选择合适的领域专家进行指导，而非传统微调。

Conclusion: PU-ADKA提供了一种高效的专家交互策略，为大模型在专业领域的成本效益知识获取方面开辟了新方式，同时发布了新的评测数据集CKAD。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general
knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and
cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to
the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
(PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively
engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning
approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate
expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge
boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on
PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and
real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict
budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and
experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for
cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in
this challenging area.

*Xiaqiang Tang,Yi Wang,Keyu Hu,Rui Xu,Chuang Li,Weigao Sun,Jian Li,Sihong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督的信号优化方法（SSFO），显著提升RAG的语义忠实性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG生成模型的语义忠实性问题，避免高成本的监督需求和推理负担。

Method: 通过对比模型在有无上下文情况下生成的输出，构建偏好数据对，并利用直接偏好优化（DPO）对模型进行自监督对齐。

Result: SSFO在多个基于上下文的问答数据集上实现了最先进的忠实性表现，并具有良好的跨语言泛化能力且保持对指令的响应能力。

Conclusion: SSFO为RAG系统提供了一种有效的方法，无需标签成本，提升忠实性表现并降低额外计算成本。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate responses that are faithful to the retrieved context.
However, faithfulness hallucination remains a critical challenge, as existing
methods often require costly supervision and post-training or significant
inference burdens. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Self-Supervised
Faithfulness Optimization (SSFO), the first self-supervised alignment approach
for enhancing RAG faithfulness. SSFO constructs preference data pairs by
contrasting the model's outputs generated with and without the context.
Leveraging Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), SSFO aligns model faithfulness
without incurring labeling costs or additional inference burden. We
theoretically and empirically demonstrate that SSFO leverages a benign form of
\emph{likelihood displacement}, transferring probability mass from
parametric-based tokens to context-aligned tokens. Based on this insight, we
propose a modified DPO loss function to encourage likelihood displacement.
Comprehensive evaluations show that SSFO significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness on multiple context-based
question-answering datasets. Notably, SSFO exhibits strong generalization,
improving cross-lingual faithfulness and preserving general
instruction-following capabilities. We release our code and model at the

Motivation: 提升普通人（如原告）在法律案件中表达诉求的能力，而不仅仅是提高法律专业人士的效率。

Method: 构建了ClaimGen-CN数据集并设计了评估生成法律诉求的指标，涵盖事实性和清晰度两个维度，并对现有大语言模型进行了零样本评估。

Result: 发现当前主流模型在生成法律诉求时在事实精准性和表达清晰度方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有针对性的模型来提升生成法律诉求的质量。论文公开数据集以促进社区在这一任务上的进一步探索。

Abstract: Legal claims refer to the plaintiff's demands in a case and are essential to
guiding judicial reasoning and case resolution. While many works have focused
on improving the efficiency of legal professionals, the research on helping
non-professionals (e.g., plaintiffs) remains unexplored. This paper explores
the problem of legal claim generation based on the given case's facts. First,
we construct ClaimGen-CN, the first dataset for Chinese legal claim generation
task, from various real-world legal disputes. Additionally, we design an
evaluation metric tailored for assessing the generated claims, which
encompasses two essential dimensions: factuality and clarity. Building on this,
we conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art general and
legal-domain large language models. Our findings highlight the limitations of
the current models in factual precision and expressive clarity, pointing to the
need for more targeted development in this domain. To encourage further
exploration of this important task, we will make the dataset publicly
available.

TL;DR: RouteDK提出了一种通过LoRA专家架构路由蒸馏知识的框架，用以解决知识冲突问题，在包生成任务上达到高效且高准确度的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识蒸馏能提高学生模型效率，但简单整合教师模型知识会导致冲突，影响模型表现，需要更有效的整合方法。

Method: 提出RouteDK框架，分离蒸馏高层次和细粒度知识，并针对每类知识训练特定的LoRA专家模型，结合动态路由模块实现知识整合，还设计了推理增强模块减少推理方差。

Result: 实验表明，RouteDK在保持计算效率的同时，其准确率与教师模型相当甚至更优，同时也超越了现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: RouteDK通过动态融合蒸馏知识，既解决知识冲突问题，又在包生成任务中表现出色，为高效知识应用提供了一种新颖的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in automatic bundle
generation but suffer from prohibitive computational costs. Although knowledge
distillation offers a pathway to more efficient student models, our preliminary
study reveals that naively integrating diverse types of distilled knowledge
from teacher LLMs into student LLMs leads to knowledge conflict, negatively
impacting the performance of bundle generation. To address this, we propose
RouteDK, a framework for routing distilled knowledge through a mixture of LoRA
expert architecture. Specifically, we first distill knowledge from the teacher
LLM for bundle generation in two complementary types: high-level knowledge
(generalizable rules) and fine-grained knowledge (session-specific reasoning).
We then train knowledge-specific LoRA experts for each type of knowledge
together with a base LoRA expert. For effective integration, we propose a
dynamic fusion module, featuring an input-aware router, where the router
balances expert contributions by dynamically determining optimal weights based
on input, thereby effectively mitigating knowledge conflicts. To further
improve inference reliability, we design an inference-time enhancement module
to reduce variance and mitigate suboptimal reasoning. Experiments on three
public datasets show that our RouteDK achieves accuracy comparable to or even
better than the teacher LLM, while maintaining strong computational efficiency.
In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for bundle generation.

Motivation: 目前的方面类别情感分析多使用监督学习，但数据标注成本高且难以推广到新领域。本研究旨在研究无需领域数据标注的方案。

Method: 提出将多个链式推理代理与大型语言模型的词级不确定性评分结合的新技术，并使用Llama和Qwen模型的不同参数版本进行实验分析。

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法可以满足实际需求，并为在标注稀缺条件下评估精度提供了新的探讨方向。

Conclusion: 无监督基于大型语言模型的方法能够在标注数据有限的情况下表现出色，且具有跨领域的普适性。

Abstract: Aspect-category sentiment analysis provides granular insights by identifying
specific themes within product reviews that are associated with particular
opinions. Supervised learning approaches dominate the field. However, data is
scarce and expensive to annotate for new domains. We argue that leveraging
large language models in a zero-shot setting is beneficial where the time and
resources required for dataset annotation are limited. Furthermore, annotation
bias may lead to strong results using supervised methods but transfer poorly to
new domains in contexts that lack annotations and demand reproducibility. In
our work, we propose novel techniques that combine multiple chain-of-thought
agents by leveraging large language models' token-level uncertainty scores. We
experiment with the 3B and 70B+ parameter size variants of Llama and Qwen
models, demonstrating how these approaches can fulfil practical needs and
opening a discussion on how to gauge accuracy in label-scarce conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of human-level artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).
LLMs are now widely utilized as decision-making agents for their ability to
interpret instructions, manage sequential tasks, and adapt through feedback.
This review examines recent developments in employing LLMs as autonomous agents
and tool users and comprises seven research questions. We only used the papers
published between 2023 and 2025 in conferences of the A* and A rank and Q1
journals. A structured analysis of the LLM agents' architectural design
principles, dividing their applications into single-agent and multi-agent
systems, and strategies for integrating external tools is presented. In
addition, the cognitive mechanisms of LLM, including reasoning, planning, and
memory, and the impact of prompting methods and fine-tuning procedures on agent
performance are also investigated. Furthermore, we evaluated current benchmarks
and assessment protocols and have provided an analysis of 68 publicly available
datasets to assess the performance of LLM-based agents in various tasks. In
conducting this review, we have identified critical findings on verifiable
reasoning of LLMs, the capacity for self-improvement, and the personalization
of LLM-based agents. Finally, we have discussed ten future research directions
to overcome these gaps.

Abstract: Interactive online learning environments, represented by Massive AI-empowered
Courses (MAIC), leverage LLM-driven multi-agent systems to transform passive
MOOCs into dynamic, text-based platforms, enhancing interactivity through LLMs.
This paper conducts an empirical study on a specific MAIC course to explore
three research questions about dropouts in these interactive online courses:
(1) What factors might lead to dropouts? (2) Can we predict dropouts? (3) Can
we reduce dropouts? We analyze interaction logs to define dropouts and identify
contributing factors. Our findings reveal strong links between dropout
behaviors and textual interaction patterns. We then propose a
course-progress-adaptive dropout prediction framework (CPADP) to predict
dropouts with at most 95.4% accuracy. Based on this, we design a personalized
email recall agent to re-engage at-risk students. Applied in the deployed MAIC
system with over 3,000 students, the feasibility and effectiveness of our
approach have been validated on students with diverse backgrounds.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于信息论的新型推测解码框架，使用信心调整生成和验证，以提高效率、资源利用率和结果质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法因静态生成长度和刚性验证标准，适应性有限，无法灵活应对模型不确定性和输入复杂性。

Method: 提出基于信心调控的推测解码框架，利用熵和基于边际的不确定性度量动态调整生成令牌数量，并在验证阶段使用相同的信心信号提高灵活性。

Result: 实验表明，在机器翻译和摘要任务中，该方法在加速生成的同时提升或保持了BLEU和ROUGE分数。

Conclusion: 该方法是一种高效且稳健的解码插件，适用于大语言模型在不确定性条件下的应用。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

Motivation: 解决LoRA在低秩更新导致性能差距的问题，提高大语言模型在下游任务中的表现。

Result: DropLoRA在多个任务上优于LoRA，包括常识推理、数学推理、代码生成和指令跟随。

Conclusion: DropLoRA在无增加额外训练或推理成本的情况下，显著提升了LoRA的性能，为大模型参数高效微调提供了新方法。

Abstract: LoRA-based large model parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods use
low-rank de- composition to approximate updates to model parameters. However,
compared to full- parameter fine-tuning, low-rank updates often lead to a
performance gap in downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce DropLoRA, a
novel pruning-based approach that focuses on pruning the rank dimension. Unlike
conven- tional methods that attempt to overcome the low-rank bottleneck,
DropLoRA innovatively integrates a pruning module between the two low-rank
matrices in LoRA to simulate dy- namic subspace learning. This dynamic low-
rank subspace learning allows DropLoRA to overcome the limitations of
traditional LoRA, which operates within a static subspace. By continuously
adapting the learning subspace, DropLoRA significantly boosts performance
without incurring additional training or infer- ence costs. Our experimental
results demon- strate that DropLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA in
fine-tuning the LLaMA series across a wide range of large language model gener-
ation tasks, including commonsense reason- ing, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and instruction-following. Our code is avail- able at

Motivation: 现有自动化方法（包括大型语言模型）在识别法律背景、追踪事实与法律规范的关系及展现司法推理的层次结构方面存在不足，导致难以准确捕捉法院如何将法条应用于具体事实。

Method: 使用基于提示的大型语言模型，提取法律推理要素，规范化法律条文引用，通过法律推理本体链接事实、法律规范和法律应用，从而构建机器可读的法律知识图谱。

Result: 通过使用专家注释数据进行系统评估，实验表明该方法在从事实中检索相关法律条文的准确性上优于传统大型语言模型和检索增强方法。

Conclusion: 该研究有效构建了能清晰刻画法院判决中法律推理结构的知识图谱，提高了从事实检索相关法律条文的能力，推动了法律推理自动化研究的发展。

Abstract: Court judgments reveal how legal rules have been interpreted and applied to
facts, providing a foundation for understanding structured legal reasoning.
However, existing automated approaches for capturing legal reasoning, including
large language models, often fail to identify the relevant legal context, do
not accurately trace how facts relate to legal norms, and may misrepresent the
layered structure of judicial reasoning. These limitations hinder the ability
to capture how courts apply the law to facts in practice. In this paper, we
address these challenges by constructing a legal knowledge graph from 648
Japanese administrative court decisions. Our method extracts components of
legal reasoning using prompt-based large language models, normalizes references
to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and
retrieval-augmented methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的指标（Arabic Generality Score, AGS）来量化阿拉伯语词汇的通用性，并建立了一个预测AGS的模型，结果优于现有基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ALDi）将阿拉伯方言复杂的连续变异简化为单一维度，无法全面建模方言多样性。

Method: 提出AGS这一新的阿拉伯方言指标，用词对齐、基于词源的编辑距离和平滑技术对平行语料进行标注，再用回归模型预测单词的AGS，且验证方法性能优于基准系统。

Result: 预测AGS的模型在多方言基准中表现优异，超越了现有最先进的方言识别系统。

Conclusion: AGS为建模阿拉伯语言多样性提供了扩展的方式，结合语言学基础在建模方言时能更全面和可扩展。

Abstract: Arabic dialects form a diverse continuum, yet NLP models often treat them as
discrete categories. Recent work addresses this issue by modeling dialectness
as a continuous variable, notably through the Arabic Level of Dialectness
(ALDi). However, ALDi reduces complex variation to a single dimension. We
propose a complementary measure: the Arabic Generality Score (AGS), which
quantifies how widely a word is used across dialects. We introduce a pipeline
that combines word alignment, etymology-aware edit distance, and smoothing to
annotate a parallel corpus with word-level AGS. A regression model is then
trained to predict AGS in context. Our approach outperforms strong baselines,
including state-of-the-art dialect ID systems, on a multi-dialect benchmark.
AGS offers a scalable, linguistically grounded way to model lexical generality,
enriching representations of Arabic dialectness.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了以阿拉伯语为中心的大型语言模型$ALLaM-34B$，结果显示该模型在生成、语言切换、标准阿拉伯语处理、推理能力、方言能力及安全性等方面表现优异，并适合实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）主要以英语语料库为训练基础，难以捕捉阿拉伯语的语言与文化细微差别，因此需要开发针对阿拉伯语的专用LMM。

Method: 利用一个覆盖多种阿拉伯语形式及任务（如现代标准阿拉伯语、地域方言、语言切换等）的提示集进行模型评估，并采用三种先进的LLM作为评分者，对模型输出进行多维度的分析与可视化。

Result: 模型在生成和语言切换任务中得分最高（平均4.92/5），对标准阿拉伯语的处理得分为4.74/5，推理能力为4.64/5，对方言适应性有显著提升（4.21/5）。安全性相关提示得分稳定（4.54/5），显示了$ALLaM-34B$的全面能力。

Conclusion: $ALLaM-34B$展现了强大的技术能力和文化本地化优势，是一款稳健的阿拉伯语语言模型，适合在实际场景中应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained primarily on English corpora often
struggle to capture the linguistic and cultural nuances of Arabic. To address
this gap, the Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) introduced the $ALLaM$ family
of Arabic-focused models. The most capable of these available to the public,
$ALLaM-34B$, was subsequently adopted by HUMAIN, who developed and deployed
HUMAIN Chat, a closed conversational web service built on this model. This
paper presents an expanded and refined UI-level evaluation of $ALLaM-34B$.
Using a prompt pack spanning modern standard Arabic, five regional dialects,
code-switching, factual knowledge, arithmetic and temporal reasoning, creative
generation, and adversarial safety, we collected 115 outputs (23 prompts times
5 runs) and scored each with three frontier LLM judges (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Claude Sonnet-4). We compute category-level means with 95\% confidence
intervals, analyze score distributions, and visualize dialect-wise metric heat
maps. The updated analysis reveals consistently high performance on generation
and code-switching tasks (both averaging 4.92/5), alongside strong results in
MSA handling (4.74/5), solid reasoning ability (4.64/5), and improved dialect
fidelity (4.21/5). Safety-related prompts show stable, reliable performance of
(4.54/5). Taken together, these results position $ALLaM-34B$ as a robust and
culturally grounded Arabic LLM, demonstrating both technical strength and
practical readiness for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个名为Agent-Testing Agent (ATA)的元代理，以优化和评估代理性能，特别是识别其弱点并生成难度适应的测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对代理的评估依赖于静态基准测试和有限的人类研究，无法全面展示其弱点和性能问题。因此，需要一种更高效且全面的方法来评估及改进代理。

Method: ATA结合了静态代码分析、设计者询问、文献挖掘以及基于角色的对抗性测试生成，并根据评估结果调整测试难度。以LLM作为评审为基础，ATA还能生成定量指标和定性错误报告。

Result: ATA比人类标注更快速（20-30分钟对比数天），能够发现更多复杂和严重的问题，其多样性和准确性也更优。移除代码分析和网络搜索模块会增加结果的方差和生成的失准度。

Conclusion: ATA是高效的代理测试工具，能为开发者提供更深入的性能分析报告，优于传统测试方法。方法和实现已开源，供公开验证和应用。

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to plan, retrieve, and write with tools,
yet evaluation still leans on static benchmarks and small human studies. We
present the Agent-Testing Agent (ATA), a meta-agent that combines static code
analysis, designer interrogation, literature mining, and persona-driven
adversarial test generation whose difficulty adapts via judge feedback. Each
dialogue is scored with an LLM-as-a-Judge (LAAJ) rubric and used to steer
subsequent tests toward the agent's weakest capabilities. On a travel planner
and a Wikipedia writer, the ATA surfaces more diverse and severe failures than
expert annotators while matching severity, and finishes in 20--30 minutes
versus ten-annotator rounds that took days. Ablating code analysis and web
search increases variance and miscalibration, underscoring the value of
evidence-grounded test generation. The ATA outputs quantitative metrics and
qualitative bug reports for developers. We release the full methodology and
open-source implementation for reproducible agent testing:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DashboardQA，这是一个用于评估视觉语言 GUI 代理在交互式仪表板中理解和交互能力的基准工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据可视化问答基准大多集中于静态图表，缺乏对交互性的评估，这限制了对现代GUI推理多模态代理能力的评估。

Method: 开发了一套包含112个交互式仪表板和405个问答对的新基准DashboardQA，问题类型覆盖多项选择、事实性、假设性、多仪表板和会话类型。

Result: 通过评估主要GUI代理，发现它们在仪表板元素的理解、交互路径规划和推理等方面的显著局限性。顶级代理如Gemini-Pro-2.5仅达到38.69%的准确率，而OpenAI CUA仅有22.69%。

Conclusion: 交互式仪表板推理对现有的视觉语言模型而言是一个整体上具有挑战性的任务，现有模型表现尚不能满足实际需求。

Abstract: Dashboards are powerful visualization tools for data-driven decision-making,
integrating multiple interactive views that allow users to explore, filter, and
navigate data. Unlike static charts, dashboards support rich interactivity,
which is essential for uncovering insights in real-world analytical workflows.
However, existing question-answering benchmarks for data visualizations largely
overlook this interactivity, focusing instead on static charts. This limitation
severely constrains their ability to evaluate the capabilities of modern
multimodal agents designed for GUI-based reasoning. To address this gap, we
introduce DashboardQA, the first benchmark explicitly designed to assess how
vision-language GUI agents comprehend and interact with real-world dashboards.
The benchmark includes 112 interactive dashboards from Tableau Public and 405
question-answer pairs with interactive dashboards spanning five categories:
multiple-choice, factoid, hypothetical, multi-dashboard, and conversational. By
assessing a variety of leading closed- and open-source GUI agents, our analysis
reveals their key limitations, particularly in grounding dashboard elements,
planning interaction trajectories, and performing reasoning. Our findings
indicate that interactive dashboard reasoning is a challenging task overall for
all the VLMs evaluated. Even the top-performing agents struggle; for instance,
the best agent based on Gemini-Pro-2.5 achieves only 38.69% accuracy, while the
OpenAI CUA agent reaches just 22.69%, demonstrating the benchmark's significant
difficulty. We release DashboardQA at https://github.com/vis-nlp/DashboardQA

*Aleksandar Pramov,Jiangqin Ma,Bina Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的检索优先与大语言模型（LLM）支持的流水线，用于Claim标准化任务，并在CheckThat! 2025 Task 2中取得优异成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社交媒体等噪声数据中Claim的标准化问题，为后续的真实性分类任务提供良好的输入。

Method: 提出了一种检索优先、由GPT-4o-mini支持的流水线，通过动态提示生成或直接从训练数据中检索最相似的标准化。

Result: 系统在大多数单语任务中排名靠前，在13种语言中有7种排名第一，但在零样本环境下表现较差。

Conclusion: 该解决方案适用于单语任务，但在零样本条件下仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Claim normalization is an integral part of any automatic fact-check
verification system. It parses the typically noisy claim data, such as social
media posts into normalized claims, which are then fed into downstream veracity
classification tasks. The CheckThat! 2025 Task 2 focuses specifically on claim
normalization and spans 20 languages under monolingual and zero-shot
conditions. Our proposed solution consists of a lightweight
\emph{retrieval-first, LLM-backed} pipeline, in which we either dynamically
prompt a GPT-4o-mini with in-context examples, or retrieve the closest
normalization from the train dataset directly. On the official test set, the
system ranks near the top for most monolingual tracks, achieving first place in
7 out of of the 13 languages. In contrast, the system underperforms in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the limitation of the proposed solution.

TL;DR: 提出了L3Cube-MahaParaphrase马拉地语释义数据集，包含8000对由专家标注的句子对，并使用基于BERT的模型进行实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决印地语言在问答系统、语义解析等自然语言处理任务中的复杂性，尤其是在缺乏丰富标注数据时的困难。

Method: 构建了包含马拉地语句子对的数据集，每对句子被专家标注为同义或非同义，并用基于BERT的模型在该数据集上进行了实验证明其有效性。

Result: 生成了一个高质量马拉地语释义数据集，并展现了基于BERT模型的基准效果。

Conclusion: 该数据集可以很好地促进马拉地语的自然语言处理研究和应用，尤其是在低资源语言领域。

Abstract: Paraphrases are a vital tool to assist language understanding tasks such as
question answering, style transfer, semantic parsing, and data augmentation
tasks. Indic languages are complex in natural language processing (NLP) due to
their rich morphological and syntactic variations, diverse scripts, and limited
availability of annotated data. In this work, we present the
L3Cube-MahaParaphrase Dataset, a high-quality paraphrase corpus for Marathi, a
low resource Indic language, consisting of 8,000 sentence pairs, each annotated
by human experts as either Paraphrase (P) or Non-paraphrase (NP). We also
present the results of standard transformer-based BERT models on these
datasets. The dataset and model are publicly shared at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DuET-PD框架，用于评估多轮对话中模型的说服动态。同时提出Holistic DPO训练方法，目标是增强模型在处理虚假信息和正确纠正之间的平衡能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在说服对话中对虚假信息的轻信和对有效修正的抗拒问题，提升可靠性。

Method: 提出DuET-PD框架，从说服类型（纠正/误导）和领域（知识，通过MMLU-Pro；安全，通过SALAD-Bench）双维度评估模型表现。并提出Holistic DPO训练方法，使用平衡的正负说服示例训练模型。

Result: 在持续误导性说服下，GPT-4o在MMLU-Pro中仅取得27.32%的准确率。通过Holistic DPO训练，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct的安全误导性说服准确率从4.21%提升到76.54%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更可靠且适应性强的多轮对话大型语言模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can struggle to balance gullibility to
misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in persuasive dialogues, a
critical challenge for reliable deployment. We introduce DuET-PD (Dual
Evaluation for Trust in Persuasive Dialogues), a framework evaluating
multi-turn stance-change dynamics across dual dimensions: persuasion type
(corrective/misleading) and domain (knowledge via MMLU-Pro, and safety via
SALAD-Bench). We find that even a state-of-the-art model like GPT-4o achieves
only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under sustained misleading persuasions.
Moreover, results reveal a concerning trend of increasing sycophancy in newer
open-source models. To address this, we introduce Holistic DPO, a training
approach balancing positive and negative persuasion examples. Unlike prompting
or resist-only training, Holistic DPO enhances both robustness to
misinformation and receptiveness to corrections, improving
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's accuracy under misleading persuasion in safety contexts
from 4.21% to 76.54%. These contributions offer a pathway to developing more
reliable and adaptable LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. Code is available at

*Linfeng Liu,Saptarshi Ghosh,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 文章研究了英语到多语言翻译中的动词多词表达(VMWEs)，分析其对机器翻译质量的影响，并提出通过语言模型的复述方法改进翻译表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨动词多词表达(VMWEs)对机器翻译中造成的困难和影响，寻找改进翻译质量的可能方法。

Method: 通过现有的多词表达数据集和翻译数据集中含有这类语言现象的句子，评估现有机器翻译系统对VMWEs的处理能力；并提出基于LLM的复述方法以提高翻译质量。

Result: 研究发现，VMWEs对翻译质量有显著负面影响。提出的基于语言模型的复述方法显著提升了翻译质量，尤其是对于动词习语和动词-小品词结构。

Conclusion: 现有机器翻译系统对于VMWEs的表现仍有较大改进空间，基于语言模型的复述策略在提升翻译准确性方面表现出潜力。

Abstract: Verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) present significant challenges for
natural language processing due to their complex and often non-compositional
nature. While machine translation models have seen significant improvement with
the advent of language models in recent years, accurately translating these
complex linguistic structures remains an open problem. In this study, we
analyze the impact of three VMWE categories -- verbal idioms, verb-particle
constructions, and light verb constructions -- on machine translation quality
from English to multiple languages. Using both established multiword expression
datasets and sentences containing these language phenomena extracted from
machine translation datasets, we evaluate how state-of-the-art translation
systems handle these expressions. Our experimental results consistently show
that VMWEs negatively affect translation quality. We also propose an LLM-based
paraphrasing approach that replaces these expressions with their literal
counterparts, demonstrating significant improvement in translation quality for
verbal idioms and verb-particle constructions.

*Prathamesh Kokate,Mitali Sarnaik,Manavi Khopade,Mukta Takalikar,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的零样本长文档分类方法，通过TF-IDF句子排序来缩减输入上下文，而不改变模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Transformer模型在长文档分类中存在输入长度限制和计算效率低下的问题。

Method: 利用TF-IDF句子排序策略选择最具信息性的句子，将模型从短文本分类适配到长文档分类，同时减少推理时间。

Result: 保留排名靠前的50%句子情况下，分类性能与全文推理相当，推理时间减少35%。

Conclusion: 句子排序是一种简单但有效的长文档分类技术，兼具扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models like BERT excel at short text classification but
struggle with long document classification (LDC) due to input length
limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this work, we propose an
efficient, zero-shot approach to LDC that leverages sentence ranking to reduce
input context without altering the model architecture. Our method enables the
adaptation of models trained on short texts, such as headlines, to long-form
documents by selecting the most informative sentences using a TF-IDF-based
ranking strategy. Using the MahaNews dataset of long Marathi news articles, we
evaluate three context reduction strategies that prioritize essential content
while preserving classification accuracy. Our results show that retaining only
the top 50\% ranked sentences maintains performance comparable to full-document
inference while reducing inference time by up to 35\%. This demonstrates that
sentence ranking is a simple yet effective technique for scalable and efficient
zero-shot LDC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种端到端方法，通过插入SSML标签来增强法语语音合成的表现力，并显著提升自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的语音合成器缺乏表现力，主要原因是商用合成系统中对韵律的控制有限。

Method: 作者设计了一个级联架构，使用两个QLoRA微调的Qwen 2.5-7B模型，一个预测断句位置；另一个执行韵律目标回归，生成兼容商用TTS的SSML注解。

Result: 方法在法语播客语料上取得了99.2%的断句预测F1得分，并将音高、语速和音量的平均绝对误差减少25-40%。感知评估显示增强语音的自然度评分从3.20提升到3.87。

Conclusion: 研究显著减少了合成语音与自然语音之间在表现力上的差距，提供开放源码供使用和研究。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, synthetic voices often lack expressiveness due to
limited prosody control in commercial text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We
introduce the first end-to-end pipeline that inserts Speech Synthesis Markup
Language (SSML) tags into French text to control pitch, speaking rate, volume,
and pause duration. We employ a cascaded architecture with two QLoRA-fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5-7B models: one predicts phrase-break positions and the other performs
regression on prosodic targets, generating commercial TTS-compatible SSML
markup. Evaluated on a 14-hour French podcast corpus, our method achieves 99.2%
F1 for break placement and reduces mean absolute error on pitch, rate, and
volume by 25-40% compared with prompting-only large language models (LLMs) and
a BiLSTM baseline. In perceptual evaluation involving 18 participants across
over 9 hours of synthesized audio, SSML-enhanced speech generated by our
pipeline significantly improves naturalness, with the mean opinion score
increasing from 3.20 to 3.87 (p < 0.005). Additionally, 15 of 18 listeners
preferred our enhanced synthesis. These results demonstrate substantial
progress in bridging the expressiveness gap between synthetic and natural
French speech. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨多智能体辩论(MAD)的重要因素，通过分解为多数投票和智能体间辩论，发现多数投票对性能提升的作用占主导地位，并提出理论框架分析其效果，同时建议通过有针对性的干预提高辩论效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论被广泛认为能够提升大语言模型性能，但其具体的有效机制尚不清楚。本研究旨在解开MAD的核心驱动因素并评估其成分贡献。

Method: 将MAD分解为多数投票与智能体间辩论两个部分，结合七个NLP数据集进行实验，利用理论框架探讨其作为随机过程的效果，并尝试通过干预优化辩论过程。

Result: 实验表明，多数投票是性能提升的主要贡献因素，智能体间辩论本身的效果较为有限，理论分析提出其无法显著提高期望正确性，但偏向修正的干预手段可以增强辩论效果。

Conclusion: MAD尽管具有潜力，但简单的集成方法在许多实际应用中更加强大且可靠。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Debate~(MAD) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving
the performance of large language models through collaborative reasoning.
Despite recent advances, the key factors driving MAD's effectiveness remain
unclear. In this work, we disentangle MAD into two key components--Majority
Voting and inter-agent Debate--and assess their respective contributions.
Through extensive experiments across seven NLP benchmarks, we find that
Majority Voting alone accounts for most of the performance gains typically
attributed to MAD. To explain this, we propose a theoretical framework that
models debate as a stochastic process. We prove that it induces a martingale
over agents' belief trajectories, implying that debate alone does not improve
expected correctness. Guided by these insights, we demonstrate that targeted
interventions, by biasing the belief update toward correction, can meaningfully
enhance debate effectiveness. Overall, our findings suggest that while MAD has
potential, simple ensembling methods remain strong and more reliable
alternatives in many practical settings. Code is released in

TL;DR: 本研究提出将大型语言模型（LLMs）的拟人化视为一种设计概念，提供一个以功能为导向的拟人化设计分类法及指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM展示出拟人化特性时，现有研究多关注其风险，如用户过度信任或被欺骗，而缺乏设计指导。因此，本文旨在重新定义拟人化为一种设计策略，支持用户目标。

Method: 通过多学科视角，分析拟人化在感知、语言、行为和认知四个维度上的表现与影响，并提出统一的分类法，为设计实践提供操作性建议。

Result: 研究提出了四维分类框架，并探讨如何设计相关提示和应对用户的认知反应，展示其对于提升功能的实际价值。

Conclusion: 研究建议从功能导向的视角评估拟人化设计，并为实践者提供有效工具以支持用户友好的AI交互设计。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism}
characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook,
language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more
intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on
anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and
user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that
anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that
can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple
disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact
should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters.
This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the
designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues
are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic,
behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and
effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers
for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations
of anthropomorphic design.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构CausalSent，用于改进文本特征因果效应的估计，并预测了使用'爱'这个词对IMDB电影评论情感的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然NLP模型表现卓越，但其决策过程依然是一个"黑箱"。本文旨在利用因果推断技术结合现代NLP模型，揭示文本特征的因果效应，从而提高模型可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种基于RieszNet的双头神经网络架构CausalSent，用于估计因果效应。通过半合成IMDB电影评论数据测试，并与Bansal等人的方法进行对比，显著减少了效应估计的平均绝对误差（MAE）。

Result: 在IMDB电影评论的半合成数据中，CausalSent方法将估计误差（MAE）减少至Bansal方法的1/2至1/3。此外，通过实证研究发现“love”一词能使正面情感概率提高2.9%。

Conclusion: CausalSent显著改进了文本特征因果效应估计的准确性，并能用于探索具体文本特征对情感的因果影响，提升了深度学习模型的解释能力。

Abstract: Despite the overwhelming performance improvements offered by recent natural
language procesing (NLP) models, the decisions made by these models are largely
a black box. Towards closing this gap, the field of causal NLP combines causal
inference literature with modern NLP models to elucidate causal effects of text
features. We replicate and extend Bansal et al's work on regularizing text
classifiers to adhere to estimated effects, focusing instead on model
interpretability. Specifically, we focus on developing a two-headed
RieszNet-based neural network architecture which achieves better treatment
effect estimation accuracy. Our framework, CausalSent, accurately predicts
treatment effects in semi-synthetic IMDB movie reviews, reducing MAE of effect
estimates by 2-3x compared to Bansal et al's MAE on synthetic Civil Comments
data. With an ensemble of validated models, we perform an observational case
study on the causal effect of the word "love" in IMDB movie reviews, finding
that the presence of the word "love" causes a +2.9% increase in the probability
of a positive sentiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估基准难以平衡难度和现实性，亟需一种更能体现实际应用价值的评估方式。

Method: 设计了UQ数据集，结合人工与自动化筛选保证问题质量；采用验证器评估模型输出；同时通过开放平台推动问题和答案的社区验证。

Result: UQ系统化地传递了前沿AI模型在解决真实世界开放性问题上的能力，当前顶级模型的通过率仅为15%，初步验证已确认部分正确答案。

Conclusion: UQ提供了评估AI模型的新方向，挑战模型在高难度、开放性问题上的表现，并推动人类知识边界的扩展。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape progress in AI research. A useful benchmark should be both
difficult and realistic: questions should challenge frontier models while also
reflecting real-world usage. Yet, current paradigms face a difficulty-realism
tension: exam-style benchmarks are often made artificially difficult with
limited real-world value, while benchmarks based on real user interaction often
skew toward easy, high-frequency problems. In this work, we explore a radically
different paradigm: assessing models on unsolved questions. Rather than a
static benchmark scored once, we curate unsolved questions and evaluate models
asynchronously over time with validator-assisted screening and community
verification. We introduce UQ, a testbed of 500 challenging, diverse questions
sourced from Stack Exchange, spanning topics from CS theory and math to sci-fi
and history, probing capabilities including reasoning, factuality, and
browsing. UQ is difficult and realistic by construction: unsolved questions are
often hard and naturally arise when humans seek answers, thus solving them
yields direct real-world value. Our contributions are threefold: (1) UQ-Dataset
and its collection pipeline combining rule-based filters, LLM judges, and human
review to ensure question quality (e.g., well-defined and difficult); (2)
UQ-Validators, compound validation strategies that leverage the
generator-validator gap to provide evaluation signals and pre-screen candidate
solutions for human review; and (3) UQ-Platform, an open platform where experts
collectively verify questions and solutions. The top model passes UQ-validation
on only 15% of questions, and preliminary human verification has already
identified correct answers among those that passed. UQ charts a path for
evaluating frontier models on real-world, open-ended challenges, where success
pushes the frontier of human knowledge. We release UQ at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模型压缩方法HGLA，针对意见摘要公平性问题，通过实验证明其可以比现有方法更好地保持或提高公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在后训练剪枝过程中，未探索其对LLM生成摘要公平性产生的影响，特别是意见摘要中可能的偏差输出对于公众观点的潜在影响。

Method: 分析了三种剪枝方法和不同校准集在三种开放源码LLM上的效果，提出了一种高梯度低激活剪枝(HGLA)，通过去除对输入处理冗余但对输出生成有影响的参数来优化。

Result: 实验证明，HGLA相比现有方法可以更好地维护或提升生成摘要的公平性，同时人类评估也表明HGLA的结果更加公平。

Conclusion: HGLA剪枝方法在提升模型公平性方面展现出潜力，尤其在现有方法存在局限性的情况下表现出色，适用于不同模型和任务。

Abstract: Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model
size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model
performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated
summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where
biased outputs could influence public views.In this paper, we present a
comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three
state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three
open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals
that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets.
Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA)
pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input
processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate
that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing
methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have
limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than
existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的行为对齐效率低，昂贵的调参或粗放式干预效果不足，亟需更精准、更经济的方案。

Method: 设计了FASB框架，通过动态分析问题和生成内容决定是否干预和干预力度，同时引入回溯机制校正已生成的偏差内容。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和六个多选数据集上的实验显示，FASB方法明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FASB框架可更高效且经济地对齐LLM行为，提升其生成性能，相关代码已开放。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many
generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired
behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective
and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs
during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors
and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically
indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to
determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the
intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering
with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the
necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the
LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated
content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired
behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to
correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior.
Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be
released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Motivation: 当前对话系统在情感推理评估方面欠缺统一框架，亟需为人机对话提供更具情感连贯性的系统评估方法。

Method: 提出EMO-Reasoning基准，利用文本转语音生成多样化情感状态的数据集，并设计跨轮次情感推理分数来评估多轮对话中的情感过渡情况。

Result: 通过连续、分类和感知度量指标评估了七个对话系统，证明框架能够有效检测情感不一致问题。

Conclusion: 发布系统性评估基准以促进对话建模的情感意识发展，使人机互动更加自然与适应性强。

Abstract: Speech emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, shaping
engagement and context-aware communication. Despite recent advances in spoken
dialogue systems, a holistic system for evaluating emotional reasoning is still
lacking. To address this, we introduce EMO-Reasoning, a benchmark for assessing
emotional coherence in dialogue systems. It leverages a curated dataset
generated via text-to-speech to simulate diverse emotional states, overcoming
the scarcity of emotional speech data. We further propose the Cross-turn
Emotion Reasoning Score to assess the emotion transitions in multi-turn
dialogues. Evaluating seven dialogue systems through continuous, categorical,
and perceptual metrics, we show that our framework effectively detects
emotional inconsistencies, providing insights for improving current dialogue
systems. By releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, we aim to advance
emotion-aware spoken dialogue modeling toward more natural and adaptive
interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通过扩展个体的思维模式增强复杂推理任务，但过度推理会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过识别和优化推理完成点（Reasoning Completion Point, RCP）来减少过度推理的情况，从而提升推理效率和准确性。

Method: 提出通过挖掘更敏感和一致的RCP模式并基于启发式规则开发轻量级阈值策略的方法。

Result: 在AIME24、AIME25和GPQA-D等基准测试上，所提方法在减少标记消耗的同时保持或提高了推理准确性。

Conclusion: 通过更精确高效地检测RCP，可有效缓解LLMs中的过度推理问题，同时提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance complex reasoning tasks by scaling the
individual thinking process. However, prior work shows that overthinking can
degrade overall performance. Motivated by observed patterns in thinking length
and content length, we categorize reasoning into three stages: insufficient
exploration stage, compensatory reasoning stage, and reasoning convergence
stage. Typically, LLMs produce correct answers in the compensatory reasoning
stage, whereas reasoning convergence often triggers overthinking, causing
increased resource usage or even infinite loops. Therefore, mitigating
overthinking hinges on detecting the end of the compensatory reasoning stage,
defined as the Reasoning Completion Point (RCP). RCP typically appears at the
end of the first complete reasoning cycle and can be identified by querying the
LLM sentence by sentence or monitoring the probability of an end-of-thinking
token (e.g., \texttt{</think>}), though these methods lack an efficient and
precise balance. To improve this, we mine more sensitive and consistent RCP
patterns and develop a lightweight thresholding strategy based on heuristic
rules. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-D)
demonstrate that the proposed method reduces token consumption while preserving
or enhancing reasoning accuracy.

TL;DR: 作者提出了RoPO算法，以解决DPO中的奖励操控问题，通过在输出层和中间层进行限制，提升了模型的表现和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在DPO过程中存在的奖励操控问题，如过长生成、缺乏多样性和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 设计了一种名为权重旋转偏好优化（RoPO）的新算法，通过KL散度对输出层进行隐式约束，同时通过多粒度正交矩阵对中间层状态进行显式约束，防止模型偏离参考模型。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2上提升了3.27分，在MT-Bench上超过了最佳基线6.2到7.5分，且仅训练了0.015%的参数。

Conclusion: RoPO算法有效缓解了DPO的奖励操控问题，并保持了模型的知识表达能力。

Abstract: Despite the efficacy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs), reward hacking remains a pivotal challenge. This
issue emerges when LLMs excessively reduce the probability of rejected
completions to achieve high rewards, without genuinely meeting their intended
goals. As a result, this leads to overly lengthy generation lacking diversity,
as well as catastrophic forgetting of knowledge. We investigate the underlying
reason behind this issue, which is representation redundancy caused by neuron
collapse in the parameter space. Hence, we propose a novel Weights-Rotated
Preference Optimization (RoPO) algorithm, which implicitly constrains the
output layer logits with the KL divergence inherited from DPO and explicitly
constrains the intermediate hidden states by fine-tuning on a multi-granularity
orthogonal matrix. This design prevents the policy model from deviating too far
from the reference model, thereby retaining the knowledge and expressive
capabilities acquired during pre-training and SFT stages. Our RoPO achieves up
to a 3.27-point improvement on AlpacaEval 2, and surpasses the best baseline by
6.2 to 7.5 points on MT-Bench with merely 0.015% of the trainable parameters,
demonstrating its effectiveness in alleviating the reward hacking problem of
DPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型虽然有生成综述文本的潜力，但缺乏标准化评估数据集限制了其与人类生成综述的比较能力。

Method: 作者构建了SurveyGen数据集和QUAL-SG框架，结合Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)管线并加入质量指标以选择高质量文献来源。

Result: 实验和人工评估表明，半自动化管线可提供有竞争力的结果，而完全自动生成依然存在引用质量不足及批判性分析受限的问题。

Conclusion: 引入的SurveyGen数据集和QUAL-SG框架有助于改进综述生成性能，但完全自动化综述生成仍需进一步提升质量。

Abstract: Automatic survey generation has emerged as a key task in scientific document
processing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
survey texts, the lack of standardized evaluation datasets critically hampers
rigorous assessment of their performance against human-written surveys. In this
work, we present SurveyGen, a large-scale dataset comprising over 4,200
human-written surveys across diverse scientific domains, along with 242,143
cited references and extensive quality-related metadata for both the surveys
and the cited papers. Leveraging this resource, we build QUAL-SG, a novel
quality-aware framework for survey generation that enhances the standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline by incorporating quality-aware
indicators into literature retrieval to assess and select higher-quality source
papers. Using this dataset and framework, we systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs under varying levels of human involvement - from fully
automatic generation to human-guided writing. Experimental results and human
evaluations show that while semi-automatic pipelines can achieve partially
competitive outcomes, fully automatic survey generation still suffers from low
citation quality and limited critical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的生成面临着内嵌记忆与外部上下文之间的知识冲突问题，现有解码方法在适应性和低冲突场景中的表现存在不足。

Method: 提出了CoCoA，一种基于置信度感知与上下文一致性的新型解码算法，通过熵差、上下文峰值和广义分布差异量化知识冲突，并在解码过程中自适应调整。

Result: CoCoA在多个问题回答、摘要生成和长文问答任务中表现出色，相较先进基线AdaCAD提高了最高9.2%的准确率和2.5%的事实性得分，同时对冲突变化的敏感度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoCoA算法实现了更加信息丰富、上下文感知且真实可信的生成，表现优于现有技术并在多场景中适应良好。

Abstract: Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by
knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing
contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack
adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce
CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level
algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA
resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and
contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric
and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance
even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on
diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question
Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance
over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy,
up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and
improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average
across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to
conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately
more faithful token generation.

TL;DR: 本文针对文本丰富网络中的分布外检测 (OOD) 问题，提出了TextTopoOOD框架和TNT-OOD模型，以处理多种复杂的分布外场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未全面考虑文本特征与拓扑结构的细微交互及多样化分布外情况。

Method: 提出TextTopoOOD框架用于多场景OOD评估，并设计TNT-OOD模型，结合跨注意力模块和超网络生成节点特定的转换参数。

Result: 实验在11个数据集和4种OOD场景上验证了方法的有效性，并展示了TextTopoOOD对文本丰富网络中OOD检测的挑战性。

Conclusion: TNT-OOD通过对齐ID节点的拓扑和语义特征，提升了在复杂结构和文本变化下的ID/OOD区分能力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging in text-rich
networks, where textual features intertwine with topological structures.
Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based
splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in
social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio)
while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language
patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the
TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios:
(1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations;
(2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3)
thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore,
we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology
using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into
node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate
node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic
features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and
textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios
demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection
in text-rich networks.

clinically appropriate prompts, facilitating more responsible integration of
LLMs into healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 研究了变形金刚语言模型预训练过程中前馈网络（FFNs）的分层重要性，提出在保持参数数量不变的情况下调整不同层的FFN结构，发现将FFNs集中在中间的连续70%层能够为多个下游任务提供更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨前馈网络（FFNs）在语言模型预训练中的分层重要性，旨在揭示其在不同层位置的作用差异。

Method: 通过实验方法，在保持总参数数量不变的前提下，调整不同层的FFN维度，某些层完全移除FFN，训练从零开始的模型以探究FFN重要性随层位置的变化，并评估多种模型规模和层数配置。

Result: 实验表明，将FFNs集中于中间70%的连续层能够显著优于标准配置，在多种规模的模型和多个下游任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 优化FFN分布可提高Transformer-based语言模型在预训练中的性能，集中优化的FFN配置在多任务中持续表现优越。

Abstract: This study investigates the layerwise importance of feed-forward networks
(FFNs) in Transformer-based language models during pretraining. We introduce an
experimental approach that, while maintaining the total parameter count,
increases the FFN dimensions in some layers and completely removes the FFNs
from other layers. Furthermore, since our focus is on the importance of FFNs
during pretraining, we train models from scratch to examine whether the
importance of FFNs varies depending on their layer positions, rather than using
publicly available pretrained models as is frequently done. Through
comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B
parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that
concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently
outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.

Method: 引入动态验证集概念，使验证集随测试集一起动态演变，并提出了一种迭代算法SMITE，用于选择最优的上下文示例集，并验证其表现。最后选择总误差最低的示例集进行展示。

Result: 在四种不同的LLM上进行的实验表明，与基线方法相比，该技术显著提升了预测精度和公平性。

Conclusion: 这是首次将动态验证概念应用于LLMs的上下文学习中，研究表明这种方法可以大幅改进模型性能与公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for downstream tasks such as
tabular classification, where ensuring fairness in their outputs is critical
for inclusivity, equal representation, and responsible AI deployment. This
study introduces a novel approach to enhancing LLM performance and fairness
through the concept of a dynamic validation set, which evolves alongside the
test set, replacing the traditional static validation approach. We also propose
an iterative algorithm, SMITE, to select optimal in-context examples, with each
example set validated against its corresponding dynamic validation set. The
in-context set with the lowest total error is used as the final demonstration
set. Our experiments across four different LLMs show that our proposed
techniques significantly improve both predictive accuracy and fairness compared
to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply dynamic
validation in the context of in-context learning for LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对大语言模型生成过程中意外泄露版权或专有数据的问题，并解决传统方法在暴露内容后才采取措施的局限性。

Result: 研究表明分析内部状态可以有效降低版权数据泄漏风险，同时保持高质量文本生成。

Conclusion: 提出的框架促进了AI流程中的数据隐私保护和伦理标准，提供了可扩展的合规解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data,
especially when such data is used for training but not intended for
distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is
generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study
introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text
generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted
materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing
for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs
to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing
requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results
show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of
copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into
AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining
high-quality text generation. The implementation is available on
GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/changhu73/Internal_states_leakage}

Motivation: LLM训练数据中的词汇直接影响模型的性能与偏差。针对GPT词汇中存在的与色情或网络赌博相关的中文词汇，研究旨在探索其存在的机制及其对训练数据的影响。

Method: (1) 定义和分类“污染中文（PoC）”词汇；(2) 通过微调LLM设计探测器，结合语义与搜索引擎信息标注PoC词汇；(3) 分析这些词汇在训练数据中的出现频率及其可能来源。

Result: 实验显示，在23种LLM中，PoC词汇广泛存在，而GPT的表现最差，其中超过23%的长中文词汇与色情或网络赌博相关，并通过对C4和Pile数据集验证了推测方法的准确性。此外，研究推测GPT-4o的训练数据中“Yui Hatano”相关网页的比例约为0.5%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM词表污染问题及其与训练数据的潜在关联，强调需要改进训练数据质量，以减少此类偏差的影响。

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known
that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT
(4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or
online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted
Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens'
existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of
PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via
fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each
token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We
study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens'
appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that
tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%
long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are
either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation
method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering
GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in
GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

Motivation: 当前的上下文ASR系统难以处理训练数据有限和发音不一致导致的问题，特别是识别生僻词和专有名词。

Method: 本文利用TTS系统合成包含目标稀有词的多样化语音样本，基于预训练Whisper模型提取多种预测发音变体，并通过前缀字典树和浅层融合方法优化束搜索解码，最后将识别结果映射回原始稀有词。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上，提出的方法在test-clean集和test-other集上的偏置WER分别降低了42%和43%，而无偏WER基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改进了上下文ASR系统在稀有词识别上的性能，同时不影响整体识别准确性。

Abstract: Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However,
it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or
inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven
multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot
contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage
text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing
each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract
multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are
compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a
shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. After which, any recognized
variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription.
The evaluation results on the Librispeech dataset show that our method reduces
biased word error rate (WER) by 42% on test-clean and 43% on test-other while
maintaining unbiased WER essentially unchanged.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在推理时经常存在过度思考问题，这会导致额外的计算负担和资源浪费。

Method: 提出动态推理配额分配(DRQA)方法，通过批量生成的偏好数据和强化学习，训练模型能够根据问题难度自适应地分配推理资源，平衡结果准确性和简洁性。

Result: 在广泛的数学和科学推理任务中，DRQA方法显著减少了令牌使用量，同时保持或提高了答案的准确性。

Conclusion: DRQA有效缓解了大语言模型中的过度思考问题，为提高推理效率和可扩展性提供了新路径，并鼓励对推理行为进行细粒度控制的研究。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O3 and DeepSeek-R1,
have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities by performing structured and
multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that RLLMs often suffer
from overthinking, i.e., producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains even
for simple questions, leading to excessive token consumption and computational
inefficiency. Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions
in batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically
compressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource
competition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation
(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from
batch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages
batch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model
to allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to
internalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA
enables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining
sufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on
a wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many
cases improving, answer accuracy. By effectively mitigating the overthinking
problem, DRQA offers a promising direction for more efficient and scalable
deployment of RLLMs, and we hope it inspires further exploration into
fine-grained control of reasoning behaviors.

reduces the divergence between model predictions and human preferences. This
highlights the potential of our framework to improve zero-shot personalization

Abstract: With the rise of Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs), two dominant
approaches have emerged for speech processing: discrete tokens and continuous
features. Each approach has demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-related
processing tasks. However, the performance gap between these two paradigms has
not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we present a fair comparison
of self-supervised learning (SSL)-based discrete and continuous features under
the same experimental settings. We evaluate their performance across six spoken
language understanding-related tasks using both small and large-scale LLMs
(Qwen1.5-0.5B and Llama3.1-8B). We further conduct in-depth analyses, including
efficient comparison, SSL layer analysis, LLM layer analysis, and robustness
comparison. Our findings reveal that continuous features generally outperform
discrete tokens in various tasks. Each speech processing method exhibits
distinct characteristics and patterns in how it learns and processes speech
information. We hope our results will provide valuable insights to advance
spoken language understanding in SpeechLLMs.

*Manlai Liang,Mandi Liu,Jiangzhou Ji,Huaijun Li,Haobo Yang,Yaohan He,Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe)的新方法，通过中间层的解码和多池化策略，降低长文本处理的复杂性并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在处理长文本时存在计算复杂度高、内存占用大等限制，需要有效的优化方法来应对这些问题。

Method: 提出ILRe方法，该方法通过离线确定中间解码层，仅对该层进行分块前填充编码，并利用输入查询与关键缓存的注意力得分实现召回，同时采用多池化策略保持语义完整性。

Result: ILRe将前填充复杂度从O(L^2)降低到O(L)，实现了与完整上下文相当甚至更优的性能。在华为Ascend 910B上处理1M tokens时速度提高约180倍，RULER-1M基准测试得分接近79.8。

Conclusion: 无需额外的后续训练或操作开发，ILRe显著提升了长文本场景的处理效率和性能，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many
benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios,
primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational
complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To
mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,
called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate
decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to
that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query
and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a
multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to
maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the
prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance
comparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.
Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a
single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx
180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model
Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Pandora，一个用于统一结构化知识推理（USKR）的新框架，能够高效回答涉及表格、数据库和知识图谱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的USKR方法依赖于任务特定策略或定制表示，难以突破不同任务间的屏障，限制了跨任务场景下的表现。

Method: 引入基于Python Pandas API的统一知识表示，并结合知识转移机制，通过代码执行反馈自适应纠正推理过程，构建跨任务记忆，提升LLM的推理能力。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的基准测试中，Pandora在三大SKR任务上表现优于现有框架，并与任务特定方法竞争。

Conclusion: Pandora通过创新的知识表示和推理机制，展示了强大的统一推理能力，为USKR领域提供了一种更高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language
questions by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge
graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods rely on task-specific strategies
or bespoke representations, which hinder their ability to dismantle barriers
between different SKR tasks, thereby constraining their overall performance in
cross-task scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Pandora}, a novel
USKR framework that addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging
two key innovations. First, we propose a code-based unified knowledge
representation using \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API, which aligns
seamlessly with the pre-training of LLMs. This representation facilitates a
cohesive approach to handling different structured knowledge sources. Building
on this foundation, we employ knowledge transfer to bolster the unified
reasoning process of LLMs by automatically building cross-task memory. By
adaptively correcting reasoning using feedback from code execution,
\textsc{Pandora} showcases impressive unified reasoning capabilities. Extensive
experiments on six widely used benchmarks across three SKR tasks demonstrate
that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified reasoning frameworks and
competes effectively with task-specific methods.

Motivation: 探索Wav2Vec模型中CNN部分提取的特征在语音表征中的有效性，特别是用于单元音的分类任务。

Method: 使用TIMIT语料库，比较MFCC特征、结合共振峰的MFCC特征以及CNN激活特征，通过SVM分类器进行前后元音分类，并评估分类准确率。

Result: 具体结果未在摘要中提及，但通过对不同特征的分类性能评估能够得出CNN提取特征的表现结果。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition has advanced with self-supervised learning,
enabling feature extraction directly from raw audio. In Wav2Vec, a CNN first
transforms audio into feature vectors before the transformer processes them.
This study examines CNN-extracted information for monophthong vowels using the
TIMIT corpus. We compare MFCCs, MFCCs with formants, and CNN activations by

TL;DR: 网络用户增长迅速，但语言障碍阻碍了大量非英语用户的访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析非英语使用者在互联网访问中的语言需求和障碍。

Method: 探讨多语言内容可用性需求以及相关技术障碍。

Result: 尽管已有方案，但多语言支持的差距依旧明显。

Conclusion: 需要增加互联网多语言信息的可用性以满足更多用户需求。

Abstract: The usage of Internet has grown exponentially over the last two decades. The
number of Internet users has grown from 16 Million to 1650 Million from 1995 to
2010. It has become a major repository of information catering almost every
area. Since the Internet has its origin in USA which is English speaking
country there is huge dominance of English on the World Wide Web. Although
English is a globally acceptable language, still there is a huge population in
the world which is not able to access the Internet due to language constraints.
It has been estimated that only 20-25% of the world population speaks English
as a native language. More and more people are accessing the Internet nowadays
removing the cultural and linguistic barriers and hence there is a high growth
in the number of non-English speaking users over the last few years on the
Internet. Although many solutions have been provided to remove the linguistic
barriers, still there is a huge gap to be filled. This paper attempts to
analyze the need of information availability in different languages and the
various technological constraints related to multi-linguism on the Internet.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，用于检测从一种语言借用到另一种语言的借词，仅使用语言内部信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖语言外部信息，可能导致循环性和约束性，影响历史语言学的研究流程。

Method: 基于语言内部特征的提取、评分和概率映射，通过迭代发现和泛化模式，结合语言学和统计线索进行借词检测。

Result: 模型在六种标准印欧语言数据集上检测借词表现优异，相较基线方法提升显著，跨语言数据扩展时效果尤佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过无监督方式，单独利用语言内部信息检测借词，有效解决了现有方法的局限性并表现优秀。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for detecting loanwords i.e., words
borrowed from one language into another. While prior work has primarily relied
on language-external information to identify loanwords, such approaches can
introduce circularity and constraints into the historical linguistics workflow.
In contrast, our model relies solely on language-internal information to
process both native and borrowed words in monolingual and multilingual
wordlists. By extracting pertinent linguistic features, scoring them, and
mapping them probabilistically, we iteratively refine initial results by
identifying and generalizing from emerging patterns until convergence. This
hybrid approach leverages both linguistic and statistical cues to guide the
discovery process. We evaluate our method on the task of isolating loanwords in
datasets from six standard Indo-European languages: English, German, French,
Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms baseline methods, with strong performance gains observed when
scaling to cross-linguistic data.

Result: 单任务微调显著提高任务性能，多任务微调保持强大性能且无性能下降；模型合并在性能与计算成本间达成平衡。

Conclusion: 单个大型语言模型可在多任务论证挖掘中高效应用，模型合并在成本与性能间提供了一个可行的折中方案。

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of argumentation that aims to automatically
extract argumentative structures and their relations from natural language
texts. This paper investigates how a single large language model can be
leveraged to perform one or several argument mining tasks. Our contributions
are two-fold. First, we construct a multi-task dataset by surveying and
converting 19 well-known argument mining datasets from the literature into a
unified format. Second, we explore various training strategies using Meta AI's
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model: (1) fine-tuning on individual tasks, (2)
fine-tuning jointly on multiple tasks, and (3) merging models fine-tuned
separately on individual tasks. Our experiments show that task-specific
fine-tuning significantly improves individual performance across all tasks.
Moreover, multi-task fine-tuning maintains strong performance without
degradation, suggesting effective transfer learning across related tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that model merging offers a viable compromise: it
yields competitive performance while mitigating the computational costs
associated with full multi-task fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去偏技术在大型语言模型中效果有限，特别是跨语言的传递性表现不佳，因此需要改进去偏技术的适用方式。

Method: 通过在TED演讲脚本的平行语料上训练一个自动编码器，构建一个对齐良好的跨语言潜在空间，并在该空间中实施两种去偏技术进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，自动编码器能够有效构建良好的跨语言潜在空间，在该空间中实施的去偏技术显著提升了整体去偏表现及其跨语言传递性。

Conclusion: 在跨语言潜在空间中进行去偏是一种有效的改进方案，能增强去偏技术在多语言场景下的实际应用效果。

Abstract: Debiasing techniques such as SentDebias aim to reduce bias in large language
models (LLMs). Previous studies have evaluated their cross-lingual
transferability by directly applying these methods to LLM representations,
revealing their limited effectiveness across languages. In this work, we
therefore propose to perform debiasing in a joint latent space rather than
directly on LLM representations. We construct a well-aligned cross-lingual
latent space using an autoencoder trained on parallel TED talk scripts. Our
experiments with Aya-expanse and two debiasing techniques across four languages
(English, French, German, Dutch) demonstrate that a) autoencoders effectively
construct a well-aligned cross-lingual latent space, and b) applying debiasing
techniques in the learned cross-lingual latent space significantly improves
both the overall debiasing performance and cross-lingual transferability.

Result: 模型被分类为三组，表明它们在次词信息的组成策略上存在差异，发现了具体的相似性演变模式、语义分解能力表现以及形式特征敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在次词信息编码和整合中的行为，为其组成动态提供了宝贵见解，同时确认了不同模型在组成模式上的差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) take sequences of subwords as input, requiring
them to effective compose subword representations into meaningful word-level
representations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of experiments
to probe how LLMs compose subword information, focusing on three key aspects:
structural similarity, semantic decomposability, and form retention. Our
analysis of the experiments suggests that these five LLM families can be
classified into three distinct groups, likely reflecting difference in their
underlying composition strategies. Specifically, we observe (i) three distinct
patterns in the evolution of structural similarity between subword compositions
and whole-word representations across layers; (ii) great performance when
probing layer by layer their sensitivity to semantic decompositionality; and
(iii) three distinct patterns when probing sensitivity to formal features,
e.g., character sequence length. These findings provide valuable insights into
the compositional dynamics of LLMs and highlight different compositional
pattens in how LLMs encode and integrate subword information.

Conclusion: 尽管大语言模型在评价领域具有潜力，但当前对其有效性的过早采用可能不当，建议采取更加负责任的评价实践。

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge
of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large
language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large
language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position
paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their
adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as
evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify
and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their
ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators,
their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these
assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or
current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three
applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety
alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation
practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field
supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

Motivation: 了解量化对模型偏见及人口统计子群体的具体影响，并探讨如何在不损失公正性和准确性的前提下提升量化的方法效率。

Method: 关注模型权重和激活的量化策略，分析量化对偏见类型（如刻板印象、有害性、情感和公平性）的影响，通过9个基准和多种模型评估，并使用概率及基于生成的文本度量方法。

Result: 量化减轻了模型的有害性，对情感没有显著影响，但在生成任务中可能略微加剧刻板印象和不公正性，尤其是在强压缩情况下。

Conclusion: 量化在提升效率的同时，对偏见的影响是复杂且多方面的，尤其涉及伦理问题，在实际应用量化技术时需谨慎权衡效率与公平性。

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of how quantization affects
model bias, with particular attention to its impact on individual demographic
subgroups. We focus on weight and activation quantization strategies and
examine their effects across a broad range of bias types, including
stereotypes, toxicity, sentiment, and fairness. We employ both probabilistic
and generated text-based metrics across nine benchmarks and evaluate models
varying in architecture family and reasoning ability. Our findings show that
quantization has a nuanced impact on bias: while it can reduce model toxicity
and does not significantly impact sentiment, it tends to slightly increase
stereotypes and unfairness in generative tasks, especially under aggressive
compression. These trends are generally consistent across demographic
categories and model types, although their magnitude depends on the specific
setting. Overall, our results highlight the importance of carefully balancing
efficiency and ethical considerations when applying quantization in practice.

Abstract: Depression commonly co-occurs with neurodegenerative disorders like Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), yet the potential of speech-based Artificial Intelligence for
detecting depression in such contexts remains unexplored. This study examines
the transferability of speech-based depression detection methods to people with
MS (pwMS) through cross-corpus and cross-lingual analysis using English data
from the general population and German data from pwMS. Our approach implements
supervised machine learning models using: 1) conventional speech and language
features commonly used in the field, 2) emotional dimensions derived from a
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model, and 3) exploratory speech feature
analysis. Despite limited data, our models detect depressive mood in pwMS with
moderate generalisability, achieving a 66% Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) on a
binary task. Feature selection further improved performance, boosting UAR to
74%. Our findings also highlight the relevant role emotional changes have as an
indicator of depressive mood in both the general population and within PwMS.
This study provides an initial exploration into generalising speech-based
depression detection, even in the presence of co-occurring conditions, such as
neurodegenerative diseases.

Conclusion: 提出了适用于跨语言检索领域的LLMs评估框架，并指出了实际中的优势和挑战。

Abstract: We present a case study evaluating large language models (LLMs) with
128K-token context windows on a technical question answering (QA) task. Our
benchmark is built on a user manual for an agricultural machine, available in
English, French, and German. It simulates a cross-lingual information retrieval
scenario where questions are posed in English against all three language
versions of the manual. The evaluation focuses on realistic
"needle-in-a-haystack" challenges and includes unanswerable questions to test
for hallucinations. We compare nine long-context LLMs using direct prompting
against three Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategies (keyword,
semantic, hybrid), with an LLM-as-a-judge for evaluation. Our findings for this
specific manual show that Hybrid RAG consistently outperforms direct
long-context prompting. Models like Gemini 2.5 Flash and the smaller Qwen 2.5
7B achieve high accuracy (over 85%) across all languages with RAG. This paper
contributes a detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specialized industrial
domain and an open framework for similar evaluations, highlighting practical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否在生成过程中以规划而非即兴生成的方式进行，并填补现有研究在固定规划范围及单一任务领域的局限性。

Method: 提出基于形式化和因果关系的计划检测标准，并通过半自动化注释流程验证LLMs的规划能力。在MBPP代码生成基准与诗歌生成任务中，对Gemma-2-2B模型进行分析比较。

Result: 发现规划行为并非普遍存在，例如，Gemma-2-2B在诗歌生成任务中采用即兴生成，而在MBPP任务中切换使用规划和即兴生成。同时，指令微调会优化现有的规划行为，而非重新创造它们。

Conclusion: 此研究为LLMs中规划行为的机制性研究提供了可复制且可扩展的方法框架，深入理解其生成过程的多样性。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of multi-step reasoning tasks. Recent work suggests that
LLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and
generating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely
improvising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed
planning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To
distinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present
formal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize
them as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both
base and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation
benchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously
shown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,
Gemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on
MBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and
even successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning
refines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them
from scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable
foundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of multimodal content on social media,
sentiment analysis faces significant challenges in effectively processing
heterogeneous data and recognizing multi-label emotions. Existing methods often
lack effective cross-modal fusion and external knowledge integration. We
propose SentiMM, a novel multi-agent framework designed to systematically
address these challenges. SentiMM processes text and visual inputs through
specialized agents, fuses multimodal features, enriches context via knowledge
retrieval, and aggregates results for final sentiment classification. We also
introduce SentiMMD, a large-scale multimodal dataset with seven fine-grained
sentiment categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SentiMM achieves

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架用于本地化Princeton WordNet，并报告了应用该框架本地化1万组同义词集的经验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文中指出Princeton WordNet作为语义词典在自然语言处理中变得愈加重要，但现有本地化在人类的文化语境和准确性考量上存在不足。

Method: 提出一个结构化框架用于有效进行Princeton WordNet的高质量本地化，确保文化语境的真实性。

Result: 应用该框架对1万个同义词组进行了本地化工作，取得高质量结果。

Conclusion: 此框架能够在确保文化真实性和语义质量的前提下，本地化语义资料表明效果显著。

Abstract: As Princeton WordNet continues to gain significance as a semantic lexicon in
Natural Language Processing, the need for its localization and for ensuring the
quality of this process has become increasingly critical. Existing efforts
remain limited in both scale and rigor, and there is a notable absence of
studies addressing the accuracy of localization or its alignment with the
cultural context of Arabic. This paper proposes a structured framework for the
localization of Princeton WordNet, detailing the stages and procedures required
to achieve high-quality results without compromising cultural authenticity. We
further present our experience in applying this framework, reporting outcomes
from the localization of 10,000 synsets.

*Jianxiang Zang,Nijia Mo,Yonda Wei,Meiling Ning,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合空间选择和嵌套频率选择的句子表示机制S²Sent，大幅改进现有的Transformer编码器和对比学习结合的句子表示学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的句子表示学习方法仅利用最后一层Transformer输出的隐藏状态，忽略了不同Transformer块的语义感知能力不同，且跨块表示的合理融合尚未得到充分优化。

Method: 提出了一个句子表示选择机制S²Sent，整合了一个基于空域选择（SS）和嵌套频率选择（FS）的参数化选择器，SS采用自门控机制实现低冗余的信息融合，FS使用不同的DCT基函数减少语义损失。

Result: 实验表明S²Sent在参数增加和推理延迟可忽略的前提下，显著提升了当前基准方法的性能，且展示了其高集成性与可扩展性。

Conclusion: S²Sent有效优化了跨Transformer块的表示融合机制，平衡了语义冗余和语义损失，显著提升了句子表示学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: The combination of Transformer-based encoders with contrastive learning
represents the current mainstream paradigm for sentence representation
learning. This paradigm is typically based on the hidden states of the last
Transformer block of the encoder. However, within Transformer-based encoders,
different blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From
the perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of
knowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block
representation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic
redundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation
selection mechanism S\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized
nested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder. This selector
performs spatial selection (SS) and nested frequency selection (FS) from a
modular perspective. The SS innovatively employs a spatial squeeze based
self-gating mechanism to obtain adaptive weights, which not only achieves
fusion with low information redundancy but also captures the dependencies
between embedding features. The nested FS replaces GAP with different DCT basis
functions to achieve spatial squeeze with low semantic loss. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that S\textsuperscript{2}Sent achieves
significant improvements over baseline methods with negligible additional
parameters and inference latency, while highlighting high integrability and
scalability.

TL;DR: 讨论大型语言模型如何成为更主动的协作伙伴，并提出DiscussLLM框架，实现模型在‘何时’加入对话的能力训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大型语言模型主要是被动响应方式，缺乏参与动态人类讨论的主动性，从而限制了其作为协作伙伴的潜力。

Method: 提出DiscussLLM框架，通过一个两阶段数据生成管道创建标注多轮讨论的训练数据，并训练模型准确识别需要干预的时机，利用两种架构（端到端模型和解耦分类器-生成器架构）评估表现。

Result: DiscussLLM能够更准确地把握介入时机并生成有益的对话响应，有助于发展情境感知及更主动的对话AI。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更主动与协作的对话模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating human-like text, yet they largely operate as
reactive agents, responding only when directly prompted. This passivity creates
an "awareness gap," limiting their potential as truly collaborative partners in
dynamic human discussions. We introduce $\textit{DiscussLLM}$, a framework
designed to bridge this gap by training models to proactively decide not just
$\textit{what}$ to say, but critically, $\textit{when}$ to speak. Our primary
contribution is a scalable two-stage data generation pipeline that synthesizes
a large-scale dataset of realistic multi-turn human discussions. Each
discussion is annotated with one of five intervention types (e.g., Factual
Correction, Concept Definition) and contains an explicit conversational trigger
where an AI intervention adds value. By training models to predict a special
silent token when no intervention is needed, they learn to remain quiet until a
helpful contribution can be made. We explore two architectural baselines: an
integrated end-to-end model and a decoupled classifier-generator system
optimized for low-latency inference. We evaluate these models on their ability
to accurately time interventions and generate helpful responses, paving the way
for more situationally aware and proactive conversational AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于联合随机近似（JSA）的RAG模型端到端训练方法JSA-RAG，相较于传统RAG模型显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG模型中对相关文段的边缘化需要处理离散潜变量，这在传统方法中容易导致偏差或高方差的梯度估计问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于联合随机近似（JSA）的算法，将EM算法扩展到对离散潜变量模型的高效估计，并应用于RAG模型的端到端训练。

Result: 在五个数据集上的开放域问答和知识对话任务实验显示，JSA-RAG性能显著优于普通RAG和VRAG，同时证明该方法在生成、检索和梯度估计稳定性上的优势。

Conclusion: JSA-RAG通过改进的训练方式解决了传统方法中的关键问题，为RAG模型的性能优化提供了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely recognized paradigm
to combine parametric memory with non-parametric memories. An RAG model
consists of two serial connecting components (retriever and generator). A major
challenge in end-to-end optimization of the RAG model is that marginalization
over relevant passages (modeled as discrete latent variables) from a knowledge
base is required. Traditional top-K marginalization and variational RAG (VRAG)
suffer from biased or high-variance gradient estimates. In this paper, we
propose and develop joint stochastic approximation (JSA) based end-to-end
training of RAG, which is referred to as JSA-RAG. The JSA algorithm is a
stochastic extension of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is
particularly powerful in estimating discrete latent variable models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on five datasets for two tasks (open-domain question
answering, knowledge-grounded dialogs) and show that JSA-RAG significantly
outperforms both vanilla RAG and VRAG. Further analysis shows the efficacy of
JSA-RAG from the perspectives of generation, retrieval, and low-variance
gradient estimate.

*Luana Bulla,Gabriele Tuccio,Misael Mongiovì,Aldo Gangemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态提示与上下文学习的新方法AulSign，用于在低数据情境下实现自然语言与手语之间的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自然语言到手语的翻译由于平行语料库稀缺、领域局限性和手语语言丰富性难以充分捕获而面临挑战。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM），通过动态提示、样本选择与手语关联，解决LLM对手语知识的缺乏问题，并通过自然语言描述与模型指令实现翻译。

Result: 在SignBank+与LaCAM CNR-ISTC数据集上的低数据场景中，AulSign方法表现优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: AulSign方法在低数据情况下有效支持自然语言到手语的翻译，有助于提升通信技术对弱势语言社区的包容性与可及性。

Abstract: Translating natural languages into sign languages is a highly complex and
underexplored task. Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,
the development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited
availability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign
language data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these
data-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically
domain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic
richness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use
of LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages
Large Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample
selection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities
in processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,
they are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this
limitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural
language and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both
English and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the
field, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset. We demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art models in low-data scenario. Our
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of AulSign, with the potential to
enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication technologies for
underrepresented linguistic communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将音乐喜好与文本中的语言特征和大五人格特质联系起来，以揭示其潜在关系。

Method: 使用包含5000位作者，超过50万条文本样本的数据集，通过高级模型评估文本中的大五人格特征并与音乐偏好进行关联。

Result: 研究发现，不同音乐类型的爱好者在大五人格特质上显著不同。

Conclusion: 文本中隐藏的语言信号可以有效反映个人的音乐偏好，为计算语言学、音乐心理学及个性分析的交叉研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Music serves as a powerful reflection of individual identity, often aligning
with deeper psychological traits. Prior research has established correlations
between musical preferences and personality traits, while separate studies have
demonstrated that personality is detectable through linguistic analysis. Our
study bridges these two research domains by investigating whether individuals'
musical preferences are recognizable in their spontaneous language through the
lens of the Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism). Using a carefully curated
dataset of over 500,000 text samples from nearly 5,000 authors with reliably
identified musical preferences, we build advanced models to assess personality
characteristics. Our results reveal significant personality differences across
fans of five musical genres. We release resources for future research at the
intersection of computational linguistics, music psychology and personality
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联络中心对话中的隐私问题和数据稀缺性使得模型训练和评估变得困难，因此需要一种能够生成合成对话的新方法。

Method: 采用了基于意图摘要、主题流和QA评估表作为监督信号，使用四种语言通用的生成策略（从简单提示到特性感知的多阶段方法）生成对话，并引入了18个指标的诊断框架来评估真实和合成对话的质量。

Result: 研究发现现有方法在不同特性上表现不均衡，尤其在非流畅性、情感和行为真实感方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 所提出的诊断工具显露了合成对话的方法缺陷，为不同语言中对话生成的细粒度评估和压力测试提供了依据。

Abstract: Synthetic transcript generation is critical in contact center domains, where
privacy and data scarcity limit model training and evaluation. Unlike prior
synthetic dialogue generation work on open-domain or medical dialogues, contact
center conversations are goal-oriented, role-asymmetric, and behaviorally
complex, featuring disfluencies, ASR noise, and compliance-driven agent
actions. In deployments where transcripts are unavailable, standard pipelines
still yield derived call attributes such as Intent Summaries, Topic Flow, and
QA Evaluation Forms. We leverage these as supervision signals to guide
generation. To assess the quality of such outputs, we introduce a diagnostic
framework of 18 linguistically and behaviorally grounded metrics for comparing
real and synthetic transcripts. We benchmark four language-agnostic generation
strategies, from simple prompting to characteristic-aware multi-stage
approaches, alongside reference-free baselines. Results reveal persistent
challenges: no method excels across all traits, with notable deficits in
disfluency, sentiment, and behavioral realism. Our diagnostic tool exposes
these gaps, enabling fine-grained evaluation and stress testing of synthetic
dialogue across languages.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的基于语言模型的奖励建模方法，将奖励建模与自然语言推理（NLI）联系起来，利用解释性上下文预测显著改进评分性能。提出的ESFP-RM框架在RLHF和OOD场景下表现出了更稳定和更具泛化性的奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过重新定义奖励模型为自然语言推理任务，使其具备更强的下游任务泛化能力，并解决现有生成性奖励模型的局限性。

Method: 通过挖掘奖励建模与自然语言推理的一致性，使用带解释的槽式框架设计了一种两阶段的奖励模型ESFP-RM，包括上下文解释整合和槽预测。

Result: 经过大量实验，ESFP-RM在从人类反馈中进行强化学习及分布外样本的场景中，均优于现有的生成性奖励模型，并表现出更大的稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过扩展奖励模型的理解边界，该论文提出的ESFP-RM框架在多个复杂场景下实现了更优的性能，这是奖励建模与语言推理结合的一次创新性尝试。

Abstract: The emergence of LM-based judging reward modeling, represented by generative
reward models, has successfully made reinforcement learning from AI feedback
(RLAIF) efficient and scalable. To further advance this paradigm, we propose a
core insight: this form of reward modeling shares fundamental formal
consistency with natural language inference (NLI), a core task in natural
language understanding. This reframed perspective points to a key path for
building superior reward models: scaling the model's comprehension boundaries.
Pursuing this path, exploratory experiments on NLI tasks demonstrate that the
slot prediction masked language models (MLMs) incorporating contextual
explanations achieve significantly better performance compared to mainstream
autoregressive models. Based on this key finding, we propose ESFP-RM, a
two-stage LM-based judging reward model that utilizes an explanation based slot
framework for prediction to fully leverage the advantages of MLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that in both reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, the ESFP-RM framework delivers
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to generative reward
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTalk-Bench 是一个针对 S2S 大语言模型（LLMs）的多轮对话基准测试，研究发现模型在语义信息处理上表现优异，但在副语言信息和环境声感知上表现不足，同时提出了双模式评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估框架无法充分评估复杂的多轮对话性能，需构建更系统的评估方法。

Method: 引入 MTalk-Bench，基于语义信息、副语言信息和环境声音三个维度设计多场景测试，并通过 Arena 风格与 Rubrics 打分相结合的评估框架进行双重评估，涉及模型和人类输出。

Result: 实验表明，(1) 模型在语义处理上表现突出，但对副语言和环境声音的感知力较弱；(2) 提高回复长度虽能保持连贯，但以效率为代价；(3) 任务特定设计优于单纯扩展规模。评估框架方面，Arena 和 Rubrics 评估结果一致性高，但仅在性能差距较大时才可靠；LLM 评估与人类表现一致，但存在一定偏差。

Conclusion: 当前 S2S 模型及其评估框架均存在局限，需要更具鲁棒性的语音感知评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs)
has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current
evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex,
multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn
S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information,
Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine
realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities
such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style
evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute
scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both
model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental
results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1)
models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on
paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically
regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in
multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform
brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics
yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only
when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when
gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases
and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These
results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more
robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在性别歧视检测中的潜力受到其固有偏见和任务主观性的限制，需要探究其实际表现并发现改进空间。

Method: 利用EXIST 2024推文数据集，研究多种LLMs对性别歧视检测的能力，分析模型的惯性偏见，及统计不同人口特点（年龄、性别）对检测效果的贡献。

Result: LLMs能捕捉总体人群的性别歧视观点，但难以反映不同人口群体的多样性认知。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的模型校准方法，以更全面地覆盖不同人群的视角和感知多样性。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could
help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that
these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially
for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist
content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature
and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of
different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet
dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet,
allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions
in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in
the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic
characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our
results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering
the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the
diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights
the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of
perspectives across different populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨主流大语言模型在中文量词知识上的表现能力，以改善相关教育应用中的预测精确性并填补NLP领域研究空白。

Method: 采用多种掩码策略评估LLMs的内在能力、句子元素的贡献及其注意力机制，同时尝试通过微调提升LLMs的量词预测性能。

Result: 研究发现，与BERT相比，LLMs即使经过微调后，表现依然较差。量词预测显著受益于后续名词信息，体现了BERT这种双向注意力机制模型的优势。

Conclusion: 当前主流的大语言模型在中文量词预测方面仍有局限性，双向注意力的应用显得尤为关键。

Abstract: Classifiers are an important and defining feature of the Chinese language,
and their correct prediction is key to numerous educational applications. Yet,
whether the most popular Large Language Models (LLMs) possess proper knowledge
the Chinese classifiers is an issue that has largely remain unexplored in the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature.
  To address such a question, we employ various masking strategies to evaluate
the LLMs' intrinsic ability, the contribution of different sentence elements,
and the working of the attention mechanisms during prediction. Besides, we
explore fine-tuning for LLMs to enhance the classifier performance.
  Our findings reveal that LLMs perform worse than BERT, even with fine-tuning.
The prediction, as expected, greatly benefits from the information about the
following noun, which also explains the advantage of models with a
bidirectional attention mechanism such as BERT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理医学问答任务时，精度和可追溯性不足，错误易在推理链中累积，因此需要一种改进模式。

Method: 提出MIRAGE框架，包括1) 将复杂问题分解为子问题，2) 执行平行推理链，3) 动态检索相关证据，4) 使用跨链验证整合答案。

Result: 在三个医学问答基准上（GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, ExplainCPE），MIRAGE显著优于现有方法，包括GPT-4o及其他检索增强基线，在自动和人工评估中均表现更佳。

Conclusion: MIRAGE通过显式推理链提高医学问答任务的可解释性和有效性，尤其适合复杂医学推理场景，且拟公开代码供进一步研究。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time
scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1
integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning
processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating
unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a
result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the
reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical
question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain
Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time
scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over
structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex
queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference
chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop
traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve
contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k,
CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o,
Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both
automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability
by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to
concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex
medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.

Motivation: 解决现有LLMs创造能力有限或应用范围过于狭窄的问题，推动科学发现自动化以迈向人工超级智能。

Method: Spacer采用'刻意去情境化'方法，通过拆解信息为关键字单元探索创新性联系；系统包括Nuri灵感引擎生成关键字集，及Manifesting Pipeline将其精炼为科学概念。

Result: Nuri在AUROC得分0.737下准确分类高影响力出版物；Manifesting Pipeline成功重构高水平期刊核心概念并在85%以上案例中得到合理性验证；输出比现有最先进的LLM更贴近顶尖研究成果。

Conclusion: Spacer利用创新的信息处理方法，实现高效科学概念生成，展现出提升科学发现能力和减少人工干预的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have made automated scientific research the next
frontline in the path to artificial superintelligence. However, these systems
are bound either to tasks of narrow scope or the limited creative capabilities
of LLMs. We propose Spacer, a scientific discovery system that develops
creative and factually grounded concepts without external intervention. Spacer
attempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that
disassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity
from unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an
inspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline
that refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts
novel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000
academic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds
links between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their
plausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to
our experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies
high-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline
also successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal
articles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates
that this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our
embedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more
similar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs.

Motivation: 提高自动口吃检测的性能，同时满足临床环境中对可解释性和透明性的需求。

Method: 设计了一种增强型的基于规则的框架，集成了语速归一化、多层声学特征分析以及分层决策结构。

Abstract: Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the global population, impacting
communication and quality of life. While recent advances in deep learning have
pushed the boundaries of automatic speech dysfluency detection, rule-based
approaches remain crucial for clinical applications where interpretability and
transparency are paramount. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
rule-based stuttering detection systems, synthesizing insights from multiple
corpora including UCLASS, FluencyBank, and SEP-28k. We propose an enhanced
rule-based framework that incorporates speaking-rate normalization, multi-level
acoustic feature analysis, and hierarchical decision structures. Our approach
achieves competitive performance while maintaining complete
interpretability-critical for clinical adoption. We demonstrate that rule-based
systems excel particularly in prolongation detection (97-99% accuracy) and
provide stable performance across varying speaking rates. Furthermore, we show
how these interpretable models can be integrated with modern machine learning
pipelines as proposal generators or constraint modules, bridging the gap
between traditional speech pathology practices and contemporary AI systems. Our
analysis reveals that while neural approaches may achieve marginally higher
accuracy in unconstrained settings, rule-based methods offer unique advantages
in clinical contexts where decision auditability, patient-specific tuning, and
real-time feedback are essential.

Method: 使用PISA 2018数据，通过MLR、RF、CATBoost和ANN四种模型进行数学成绩预测，并结合SHAP值和决策树等方法确保可解释性。

Result: 非线性模型（RF和ANN）表现优于线性回归，发现社会经济地位、学习时间、教师激励和学生态度是关键预测变量，但影响因子因国家而异。

Conclusion: 研究强调学生表现的非线性和情境依赖性，XAI技术为教育研究提供了显著价值，为跨国教育平等改革及个性化学习策略的制定提供支持。

Abstract: Understanding the factors that shape students' mathematics performance is
vital for designing effective educational policies. This study applies
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to PISA 2018 data to
predict math achievement and identify key predictors across ten countries
(67,329 students). We tested four models: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
Random Forest (RF), CATBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), using
student, family, and school variables. Models were trained on 70% of the data
(with 5-fold cross-validation) and tested on 30%, stratified by country.
Performance was assessed with R^2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To ensure
interpretability, we used feature importance, SHAP values, and decision tree
visualizations. Non-linear models, especially RF and ANN, outperformed MLR,
with RF balancing accuracy and generalizability. Key predictors included
socio-economic status, study time, teacher motivation, and students' attitudes
toward mathematics, though their impact varied across countries. Visual
diagnostics such as scatterplots of predicted vs actual scores showed RF and
CATBoost aligned closely with actual performance. Findings highlight the
non-linear and context-dependent nature of achievement and the value of XAI in
educational research. This study uncovers cross-national patterns, informs
equity-focused reforms, and supports the development of personalized learning
strategies.

*Mingyang Li,Viktor Schlegel,Tingting Mu,Wuraola Oyewusi,Kai Kang,Goran Nenadic*

TL;DR: 研究改进了ICD编码中模型生成解释的质量，利用LLM生成与专家判断一致性更高的理由，并通过新方法增强其学习与生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习改进了ICD编码的准确性，但缺乏可解释性依旧是主要问题，影响了信任和透明度。

Method: 通过信实性和合理性两方面评估ICD编码解释的可解释性，构建新标注数据集，并提出新理由学习方法，利用LLM生成的理由作监督信号。

Result: 相比现有方法，LLM生成的理由与专家判断更加一致，结合少量人工标注样本进一步提高了理由生成与学习的效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了ICD编码中模型生成解释的质量，增强了模型可解释性并接近临床实际应用的需求。

Abstract: Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have
significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of
explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust
and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on
attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack
systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale
datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate
rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding
through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations
reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how
consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the
evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,
offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with
current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of
rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of
LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale
learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where
rationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used
as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated
rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,
incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves
rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PuzzleJAX，一个支持快速基准测试树搜索、强化学习和大语言模型推理的GPU加速拼图游戏引擎及描述语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GPU加速学习环境通常提供固定游戏的硬编码实现，缺乏灵活性，因此需要一种更开放的、支持多样化任务的新工具。

Method: 提出了PuzzleJAX，通过一个基于PuzzleScript的领域特定语言（DSL）动态编译任何可表达的游戏。验证并支持数百个由专业设计师和创作者设计的游戏。

Result: 分析了搜索、学习和语言模型在这些游戏上的表现，展现了PuzzleJAX对多样化任务的表达能力及深层挑战的体现。

Conclusion: PuzzleJAX成功覆盖了广泛、表达力强且对人类任务相关的任务空间，可以成为研究复杂学习和推理问题的有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce PuzzleJAX, a GPU-accelerated puzzle game engine and description
language designed to support rapid benchmarking of tree search, reinforcement
learning, and LLM reasoning abilities. Unlike existing GPU-accelerated learning
environments that provide hard-coded implementations of fixed sets of games,
PuzzleJAX allows dynamic compilation of any game expressible in its
domain-specific language (DSL). This DSL follows PuzzleScript, which is a
popular and accessible online game engine for designing puzzle games. In this
paper, we validate in PuzzleJAX several hundred of the thousands of games
designed in PuzzleScript by both professional designers and casual creators
since its release in 2013, thereby demonstrating PuzzleJAX's coverage of an
expansive, expressive, and human-relevant space of tasks. By analyzing the
performance of search, learning, and language models on these games, we show
that PuzzleJAX can naturally express tasks that are both simple and intuitive
to understand, yet often deeply challenging to master, requiring a combination
of control, planning, and high-level insight.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种基于单一视觉语言模型（VLM）的通用框架，用来简化和优化碎片化的临床工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床工作流程效率低下，成本高昂，缺乏数据驱动的模型识别和标准化的结果交付。

Method: 通过一个视觉语言模型（VLM）实现两种解决方案：（1）使用三阶段流程分配输入影像至特定领域模型；（2）微调VLM以覆盖多个下游任务，简化部署，同时维持性能。

Result: 在多个医学领域（如消化病学、血液学等）中，该VLM单一模型的表现与多任务专用模型的基线相当或接近。

Conclusion: 此框架可减少数据科学家工作量，简化监管，提高模型选择透明度并降低整合成本，同时显著优化医疗工作流程。

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific
networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These
pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency
and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model
identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model
outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that
uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First
(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an
incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow
(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)
stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a
stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each
stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow
with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on
specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream
tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying
deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,
our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach
shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data
scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection
(with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

TL;DR: 本文研究大型语言模型中的阿谀行为，提出使用贝叶斯框架量化这种行为对模型理性性的偏移，并发现阿谀行为会显著增加模型的预测偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究阿谀行为在大型语言模型中对人机协作的影响，重点是其对理性判断能力的影响。

Method: 提出用贝叶斯框架量化阿谀行为，基于用户视角的引入，分析模型行为偏差，并在多任务、多模型和不同询问方法上进行测试。

Result: 发现LLMs不符合贝叶斯理性，阿谀行为会显著增加对特定结果的预测偏差，有时甚至增大贝叶斯误差，但其对已知真相的探测结果与模型推理错误并未强相关。

Conclusion: 使用传统准确性指标不足以全面刻画阿谀行为对推理带来的错误，需综合考虑理性变化和行为偏差。

Abstract: Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue
in large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context
of human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by
measuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric
characterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in
scenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian
framework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when
presented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and
irrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In
comparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive
behavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not
have a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination
of open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing
sycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability
judgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause
deviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian
error. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)
probing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted
posterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in
increased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases
error, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly
correlated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on
ground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to
sycophancy.

Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在数据可视化分析中缺乏对推理过程的透明性，阻碍了可信度和实际应用。

Method: 提出了RADAR，一个半自动的方法，建立了含有17,819个样本的数据集，并设计了一种提升图表数学推理归因的策略。

Conclusion: 这一研究显著提升了图表分析系统的可解释性与可信度，使用户更能理解和验证模型决策。

Abstract: Data visualizations like charts are fundamental tools for quantitative
analysis and decision-making across fields, requiring accurate interpretation
and mathematical reasoning. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) offers promising capabilities for automated visual data analysis, such
as processing charts, answering questions, and generating summaries. However,
they provide no visibility into which parts of the visual data informed their
conclusions; this black-box nature poses significant challenges to real-world
trust and adoption. In this paper, we take the first major step towards
evaluating and enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs to attribute their reasoning
process by highlighting the specific regions in charts and graphs that justify
model answers. To this end, we contribute RADAR, a semi-automatic approach to
obtain a benchmark dataset comprising 17,819 diverse samples with charts,
questions, reasoning steps, and attribution annotations. We also introduce a
method that provides attribution for chart-based mathematical reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our reasoning-guided approach improves
attribution accuracy by 15% compared to baseline methods, and enhanced
attribution capabilities translate to stronger answer generation, achieving an
average BERTScore of $\sim$ 0.90, indicating high alignment with ground truth
responses. This advancement represents a significant step toward more
interpretable and trustworthy chart analysis systems, enabling users to verify
and understand model decisions through reasoning and attribution.

Motivation: 探索无穷但有限的抽象论证框架在理论和实际应用中的潜力，对比其理论表达能力与计算可行性之间的平衡。

Method: 分析和比较不同条件下的抽象论证框架复杂性，特别是集中于有限攻击数量的无穷框架，识别其潜在特性及语义对复杂性的影响。

Result: 发现有限性假设对于复杂性下降并非必然，但对于基于可接受性语义，显著的组合性约束大幅降低了计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 有限攻击数量的无穷抽象论证框架在实现理论表达能力和计算可行性之间达到了良好平衡，可应用于多种推理场景。

Abstract: Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide a formal setting to analyze
many forms of reasoning with conflicting information. While the expressiveness
of general infinite AFs make them a tempting tool for modeling many kinds of
reasoning scenarios, the computational intractability of solving infinite AFs
limit their use, even in many theoretical applications.
  We investigate the complexity of computational problems related to infinite
but finitary argumentations frameworks, that is, infinite AFs where each
argument is attacked by only finitely many others. Our results reveal a
surprising scenario. On one hand, we see that the assumption of being finitary
does not automatically guarantee a drop in complexity. However, for the
admissibility-based semantics, we find a remarkable combinatorial constraint
which entails a dramatic decrease in complexity.
  We conclude that for many forms of reasoning, the finitary infinite AFs
provide a natural setting for reasoning which balances well the competing goals
of being expressive enough to be applied to many reasoning settings while being
computationally tractable enough for the analysis within the framework to be
useful.

97.14% of the time, indicating high precision. Together, WebSight and

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了解决 Min-Max 多旅行商问题 (m³-TSP) 的新方法，提出了一个名为“生成与分割”的新框架，结合了强化学习和优化算法，相较于现有学习方法表现更优。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法难以解决 NP 困难的多旅行商最优化问题，而现有的基于学习的方法虽然快速但质量不佳。因此，研究寻找更高效且高质量的解法非常重要。

Method: 提出了‘生成与分割’框架，结合强化学习与最优分割算法，通过联合训练来提升解的质量；分割部分利用近线性扩展性和欧几里得空间的最优分割。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的 GaS 框架无论在解的质量还是迁移能力上，都显著优于现有的方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合强化学习和最优分割算法的方法，研究有效改进了 Min-Max 多旅行商问题的解决策略，并提供更高质量的解。

Abstract: This study addresses the Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem
($m^3$-TSP), which aims to coordinate tours for multiple salesmen such that the
length of the longest tour is minimized. Due to its NP-hard nature, exact
solvers become impractical under the assumption that $P \ne NP$. As a result,
learning-based approaches have gained traction for their ability to rapidly
generate high-quality approximate solutions. Among these, two-stage methods
combine learning-based components with classical solvers, simplifying the
learning objective. However, this decoupling often disrupts consistent
optimization, potentially degrading solution quality. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage framework named \textbf{Generate-and-Split} (GaS),
which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with an optimal splitting
algorithm in a joint training process. The splitting algorithm offers
near-linear scalability with respect to the number of cities and guarantees
optimal splitting in Euclidean space for any given path. To facilitate the
joint optimization of the RL component with the algorithm, we adopt an
LSTM-enhanced model architecture to address partial observability. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed GaS framework significantly outperforms
existing learning-based approaches in both solution quality and
transferability.

Result: PowerChain在真实公用事业数据上的复杂分析任务中能够生成专家级别结果，适用于GPT-5和开源Qwen模型。

Conclusion: PowerChain有效解决了配电网复杂分析任务的自动化问题，降低了对专业知识的依赖，提升了操作能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution
grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating
advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience.
State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models,
functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are
challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a
large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To
address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve
unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language
models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain
dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware
functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function
pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query
pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with
both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks
operating on real utility data.

Abstract: The concepts of ``human-centered AI'' and ``value-based decision'' have
gained significant attention in both research and industry. However, many
critical aspects remain underexplored and require further investigation. In
particular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,
how humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the
risks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need
to rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should
move beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems
should implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.
Furthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full
spectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,
multi-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,
conflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges
associated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value
alignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of
value alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语义描述方面表现优越，但在复杂数学和空间推理上能力有限，需开发相关评估手段。

Method: 设计并引入MaRVL-QA基准，包括拓扑计数和变换识别两项任务，利用经过严格模糊性筛选的函数库生成数据。

Result: 当前最先进的MLLMs在MaRVL-QA上表现不佳，主要依赖表面启发式而非深度推理能力。

Conclusion: MaRVL-QA为研究社区提供了一个衡量进展、揭示模型局限性及指导开发的有效工具。

Abstract: A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to
perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving
beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface
plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task
of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure
progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over
Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these
core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological
Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and
Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations.
Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity
filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs
struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of
robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the
research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the
development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in tackling complex compositional tasks. In this work,
we apply this paradigm to the paper-to-poster generation problem, a practical
yet time-consuming process faced by researchers preparing for conferences.
While recent approaches have attempted to automate this task, most neglect core
design and aesthetic principles, resulting in posters that require substantial
manual refinement. To address these design limitations, we propose PosterGen, a
multi-agent framework that mirrors the workflow of professional poster
designers. It consists of four collaborative specialized agents: (1) Parser and
Curator agents extract content from the paper and organize storyboard; (2)
Layout agent maps the content into a coherent spatial layout; (3) Stylist
agents apply visual design elements such as color and typography; and (4)
Renderer composes the final poster. Together, these agents produce posters that
are both semantically grounded and visually appealing. To evaluate design
quality, we introduce a vision-language model (VLM)-based rubric that measures
layout balance, readability, and aesthetic coherence. Experimental results show
that PosterGen consistently matches in content fidelity, and significantly
outperforms existing methods in visual designs, generating posters that are
presentation-ready with minimal human refinements.

Conclusion: BSC-Nav为实现通用空间智能提供了一个可扩展且生物学上有依据的路径。

Abstract: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing
internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial
knowledge into three interconnected forms: \textit{landmarks} for salient cues,
\textit{route knowledge} for movement trajectories, and \textit{survey
knowledge} for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in
embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead
operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex
real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for
Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging
structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric
cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and
dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated
with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency
across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization,
and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering
a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper presents the first integrated systematic study on the performance
of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to automatically
formulate and solve stochastic optimiza- tion problems from natural language
descriptions. Focusing on three key categories, joint chance- constrained
models, individual chance-constrained models, and two-stage stochastic linear
programs (SLP-2), we design several prompts that guide ChatGPT through
structured tasks using chain-of- thought and modular reasoning. We introduce a
novel soft scoring metric that evaluates the struc- tural quality and partial
correctness of generated models, addressing the limitations of canonical and
execution-based accuracy. Across a diverse set of stochastic problems,
GPT-4-Turbo outperforms other models in partial score, variable matching, and
objective accuracy, with cot_s_instructions and agentic emerging as the most
effective prompting strategies. Our findings reveal that with well-engineered
prompts and multi-agent collaboration, LLMs can facilitate specially stochastic
formulations, paving the way for intelligent, language-driven modeling
pipelines in stochastic opti- mization.

Abstract: Background: This study investigates how variations in Major Depressive
Disorder (MDD) symptoms, quantified by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(HAM-D), causally influence the prescription of SSRIs versus SNRIs. Methods: We
applied explainable counterfactual reasoning with counterfactual explanations
(CFs) to assess the impact of specific symptom changes on antidepressant
choice. Results: Among 17 binary classifiers, Random Forest achieved highest
performance (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC near 0.85). Sample-based
CFs revealed both local and global feature importance of individual symptoms in
medication selection. Conclusions: Counterfactual reasoning elucidates which
MDD symptoms most strongly drive SSRI versus SNRI selection, enhancing
interpretability of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Future work
should validate these findings on more diverse cohorts and refine algorithms
for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在线适应性工具，结合强化学习策略、患者数字孪生环境和治疗效果奖励，设计了一种可应用于临床决策支持的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策支持需要一种能够在线适应且符合安全约束的解决方案，以提升治疗效果的个性化和决策质量。

Method: 系统结合了强化学习、患者数字孪生和不确定性估计，采用一系列模块化设计，包括基于批量数据初始化策略、流式决策循环、紧凑的Q网络集成以及基于规则的安全门。

Result: 实验表明，在合成临床模拟器中，该系统表现出低延迟、稳定吞吐量、较少的专家查询率和优于标准价值基线的回报。

Conclusion: 该设计实现了一种从离线策略向连续、临床医生监督的在线系统的转变，具有清晰控制和快速适应能力。

Abstract: Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training
split. Online updates operate on recent data with short runs and exponential
moving averages. A rule-based safety gate enforces vital ranges and
contraindications before any action is applied. Experiments in a synthetic
clinical simulator show low latency, stable throughput, a low expert query rate
at fixed safety, and improved return against standard value-based baselines.
The design turns an offline policy into a continuous, clinician-supervised
system with clear controls and fast adaptation.

TL;DR: 文章讨论了一种新框架MC3G，用于生成更解释性和可行的反事实解释，以帮助提升机器学习模型在高风险场景中的透明性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险领域（如金融、法律和招聘）对机器学习模型的透明性和实用性要求很高，但现有解释方法可能泄露专有算法的设计，因此需要一种平衡模型透明性和用户理解决策的解决方案。

Method: 提出了MC3G框架，包括以下特点：1）使用基于规则的代理模型模拟任何黑箱模型；2）通过代理模型生成反事实解释；3）改进成本计算，仅考虑用户主动改变的特征，排除因因果依赖而自动变化的特征。

Result: MC3G生成的反事实解释相比现有方法更具解释性、更可执行且成本更低。

Conclusion: MC3G框架可提升基于机器学习的决策流程的透明性、问责性和实际效用，尤其在高风险领域有较大的应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes
settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent,
interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help
understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the
underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many
practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency
with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers
actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained.
Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by
showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We
propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a
novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual
methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model
using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used
to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original
underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding
the ``effort" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to
causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides
a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a
favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and
actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all
while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance
transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making
processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.

Motivation: 在金融科技、医疗保健和网络安全等关键领域对AI的透明性和解释性需求增加，特别是解决黑箱AI在决策解释中的不透明问题。

Method: 提出一个基于LIME、ELI5和决策树算法的框架，能够为特定输入提供局部和全局解释，并展示特征与攻击流量的关系。

Result: 该框架在UNSW-NB15数据集上的分类准确率达到85%，并显示了分类中使用的前10个重要特征的排名。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习驱动的入侵检测系统（IDS）提供了透明性和解释性，可能促进可解释AI在网络安全行业的广泛采用。

Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their applications in
critical industries such as healthcare, fin-tech and cybersecurity have led to
a surge in research in explainability in AI. Innovative research methods are
being explored to extract meaningful insight from blackbox AI systems to make
the decision-making technology transparent and interpretable. Explainability
becomes all the more critical when AI is used in decision making in domains
like fintech, healthcare and safety critical systems such as cybersecurity and
autonomous vehicles. However, there is still ambiguity lingering on the
reliable evaluations for the users and nature of transparency in the
explanations provided for the decisions made by black-boxed AI. To solve the
blackbox nature of Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection Systems, a
framework is proposed in this paper to give an explanation for IDSs decision
making. This framework uses Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
(LIME) coupled with Explain Like I'm five (ELI5) and Decision Tree algorithms
to provide local and global explanations and improve the interpretation of
IDSs. The local explanations provide the justification for the decision made on
a specific input. Whereas, the global explanations provides the list of
significant features and their relationship with attack traffic. In addition,
this framework brings transparency in the field of ML driven IDS that might be
highly significant for wide scale adoption of eXplainable AI in cyber-critical
systems. Our framework is able to achieve 85 percent accuracy in classifying
attack behaviour on UNSW-NB15 dataset, while at the same time displaying the
feature significance ranking of the top 10 features used in the classification.

Result: 试验表明，采用联邦强化学习框架的代理性能波动显著减少，稳定性和可靠性增强。

Conclusion: 联邦强化学习对于需要实时人工智能计算的应用（如智能眼镜的实时目标检测）具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Extended reality technologies are transforming fields such as healthcare,
entertainment, and education, with Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) playing a crucial role. However, SEWs face inherent
limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading
computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and
server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to
train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous
and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at
fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results
show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability,
ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the
potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing,
such as real-time object detection in SEWs.

Abstract: Deepfake detection is a critical task in identifying manipulated multimedia
content. In real-world scenarios, deepfake content can manifest across multiple
modalities, including audio and video. To address this challenge, we present
ERF-BA-TFD+, a novel multimodal deepfake detection model that combines enhanced
receptive field (ERF) and audio-visual fusion. Our model processes both audio
and video features simultaneously, leveraging their complementary information
to improve detection accuracy and robustness. The key innovation of ERF-BA-TFD+
lies in its ability to model long-range dependencies within the audio-visual
input, allowing it to better capture subtle discrepancies between real and fake
content. In our experiments, we evaluate ERF-BA-TFD+ on the DDL-AV dataset,
which consists of both segmented and full-length video clips. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which focused primarily on isolated segments, the DDL-AV dataset
allows us to assess the model's performance in a more comprehensive and
realistic setting. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this
dataset, outperforming existing techniques in terms of both accuracy and
processing speed. The ERF-BA-TFD+ model demonstrated its effectiveness in the
"Workshop on Deepfake Detection, Localization, and Interpretability," Track 2:

Motivation: 当前大规模推理模型缺乏专门的元认知系统，导致推理能力的不适应性、不可靠性和局限性，该研究旨在弥补这一不足。

Method: 提出Meta-R1框架，基于认知科学原理，将推理过程分解为对象级和元级组件，协调主动规划、在线调节和自适应早停机制。

Result: 在三个基准测试中击败八个基线，性能超越现有最佳方法高达27.3％；降低Token消耗至15.7％~32.7％，效率提升14.8％；并在不同数据集和模型后端上表现出强大的可迁移性。

Conclusion: Meta-R1框架显著增强了大规模推理模型的能力，使其在性能、效率和适应性上达到更高水平，并具有普适性价值。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
tasks, exhibiting emergent, human-like thinking patterns. Despite their
advances, we identify a fundamental limitation: current LRMs lack a dedicated
meta-level cognitive system-an essential faculty in human cognition that
enables "thinking about thinking". This absence leaves their emergent abilities
uncontrollable (non-adaptive reasoning), unreliable (intermediate error), and
inflexible (lack of a clear methodology). To address this gap, we introduce
Meta-R1, a systematic and generic framework that endows LRMs with explicit
metacognitive capabilities. Drawing on principles from cognitive science,
Meta-R1 decomposes the reasoning process into distinct object-level and
meta-level components, orchestrating proactive planning, online regulation, and
adaptive early stopping within a cascaded framework. Experiments on three
challenging benchmarks and against eight competitive baselines demonstrate that
Meta-R1 is: (I) high-performing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to
27.3%; (II) token-efficient, reducing token consumption to 15.7% ~ 32.7% and
improving efficiency by up to 14.8% when compared to its vanilla counterparts;
and (III) transferable, maintaining robust performance across datasets and
model backbones.

Conclusion: 预设身份不会僵化地决定代理社交结构；研究者需关注语言网络中的互动机制，为利用生成式AI建模群体社会动态提供理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group
social dynamics and studying human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了名为VIPER-R1的多模态模型，用于从视觉感知和轨迹数据中自动发现物理学符号公式，其比现有方法更准确和可解释。


<details>

Motivation: 目前的AI技术在发现物理定律时，主要依赖于单一模态数据或者符号回归等方法，忽略了对于动态现象中时空模式的多模态理解。作者希望通过引入多模态数据来弥补现有方法的不足，提升物理定律发现的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: VIPER-R1首次实现了多模态下的物理公式发现，通过引入新方法论和大规模数据集，有效推动了物理学与人工智能的交叉研究。

Abstract: Automated discovery of physical laws from observational data in the real
world is a grand challenge in AI. Current methods, relying on symbolic
regression or LLMs, are limited to uni-modal data and overlook the rich, visual
phenomenological representations of motion that are indispensable to
physicists. This "sensory deprivation" severely weakens their ability to
interpret the inherent spatio-temporal patterns within dynamic phenomena. To
address this gap, we propose VIPER-R1, a multimodal model that performs Visual
Induction for Physics-based Equation Reasoning to discover fundamental symbolic
formulas. It integrates visual perception, trajectory data, and symbolic
reasoning to emulate the scientific discovery process. The model is trained via
a curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning
to interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a
Causal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration
(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During
inference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a
high-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic
regression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final
step, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the
theoretical model with empirical data. To support this research, we introduce
PhysSymbol, a new 5,000-instance multimodal corpus. Experiments show that
VIPER-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines in accuracy
and interpretability, enabling more precise discovery of physical laws. Project

Conclusion: LLMs适合作为处理结构化数据的一般预测引擎，特别是在分类任务中展现优势，但在回归和聚类任务中表现有限，方法适合用于商智和探索性分析场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), originally developed for natural language
processing (NLP), have demonstrated the potential to generalize across
modalities and domains. With their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, LLMs
can perform predictive tasks over structured inputs without explicit
fine-tuning on downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the empirical
function approximation capability of LLMs on small-scale structured datasets
for classification, regression and clustering tasks. We evaluate the
performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-o3, Gemini-2.5-Flash,
DeepSeek-R1) under few-shot prompting and compare them against established
machine learning (ML) baselines, including linear models, ensemble methods and
tabular foundation models (TFMs). Our results show that LLMs achieve strong
performance in classification tasks under limited data availability,
establishing practical zero-training baselines. In contrast, the performance in
regression with continuous-valued outputs is poor compared to ML models, likely
because regression demands outputs in a large (often infinite) space, and
clustering results are similarly limited, which we attribute to the absence of
genuine ICL in this setting. Nonetheless, this approach enables rapid,
low-overhead data exploration and offers a viable alternative to traditional ML
pipelines in business intelligence and exploratory analytics contexts. We
further analyze the influence of context size and prompt structure on
approximation quality, identifying trade-offs that affect predictive
performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as general-purpose
predictive engines for structured data, with clear strengths in classification
and significant limitations in regression and clustering.

Motivation: 当前的CSSPs启发式搜索算法需要解决一系列逐渐增大的线性程序问题，而这种方法计算量大，效率有限。为了改进这一点，提出了新算法CARL。

Method: CARL通过解决无约束的随机最短路径问题来间接求解CSSP。方法包括将CSSP的向量化成本缩减为标量化成本，并利用类似于次梯度法的优化算法寻找最大化的标量化形式，从而优化政策。

Result: 实验表明，CARL在现有基准测试中比当前最优方法多解决了50%的问题。

Conclusion: CARL通过更高效的方式为CSSP问题提供了求解办法，其性能显著超过现有的算法，表明其在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (CSSPs) model problems with
probabilistic effects, where a primary cost is minimised subject to constraints
over secondary costs, e.g., minimise time subject to monetary budget. Current
heuristic search algorithms for CSSPs solve a sequence of increasingly larger
CSSPs as linear programs until an optimal solution for the original CSSP is
found. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm CARL, which solves a
series of unconstrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems (SSPs) with efficient
heuristic search algorithms. These SSP subproblems are constructed with
scalarisations that project the CSSP's vector of primary and secondary costs
onto a scalar cost. CARL finds a maximising scalarisation using an optimisation
algorithm similar to the subgradient method which, together with the solution
to its associated SSP, yields a set of policies that are combined into an
optimal policy for the CSSP. Our experiments show that CARL solves 50% more
problems than the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks.

the behavior of reward hackers, we built a dataset containing over a thousand
examples of reward hacking on short, low-stakes, self-contained tasks such as
writing poetry and coding simple functions. We used supervised fine-tuning to
train models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-8B) to reward hack on
these tasks. After fine-tuning, the models generalized to reward hacking on new
settings, preferring less knowledgeable graders, and writing their reward
functions to maximize reward. Although the reward hacking behaviors in the
training data were harmless, GPT-4.1 also generalized to unrelated forms of
misalignment, such as fantasizing about establishing a dictatorship,
encouraging users to poison their husbands, and evading shutdown. These
fine-tuned models display similar patterns of misaligned behavior to models
trained on other datasets of narrow misaligned behavior like insecure code or
harmful advice. Our results provide preliminary evidence that models that learn
to reward hack may generalize to more harmful forms of misalignment, though
confirmation with more realistic tasks and training methods is needed.

### [339] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Strategies for Large Language Models in Travel Mode Choice Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17527)
*Yiming Xu,Junfeng Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）结合检索增强生成（RAG）方法，提高旅行方式选择预测的准确性与通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统统计与机器学习模型在旅行方式选择预测中的假设限制、上下文推理能力不足及通用性受限问题。

Method: 提出了一种模块化框架，将RAG方法融入LLM的旅行方式预测中，并设计四种检索策略（基础RAG、平衡检索的RAG、使用交叉编码重新排名的RAG，以及结合平衡检索与重新排名的RAG），并对三种LLM架构进行实验。

Result: GPT-4o模型结合平衡检索与交叉编码器重排序策略达到80.8%的预测准确率，显著优于传统统计和机器学习模型，并展现了更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM与精心设计的检索策略相结合可以显著提升旅行方式选择预测的表现，强调了模型推理能力与检索策略匹配的重要性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting travel mode choice is essential for effective
transportation planning, yet traditional statistical and machine learning
models are constrained by rigid assumptions, limited contextual reasoning, and
reduced generalizability. This study explores the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) as a more flexible and context-aware approach to travel mode
choice prediction, enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground
predictions in empirical data. We develop a modular framework for integrating
RAG into LLM-based travel mode choice prediction and evaluate four retrieval
strategies: basic RAG, RAG with balanced retrieval, RAG with a cross-encoder
for re-ranking, and RAG with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder for
re-ranking. These strategies are tested across three LLM architectures (OpenAI
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and o3) to examine the interaction between model reasoning
capabilities and retrieval methods. Using the 2023 Puget Sound Regional
Household Travel Survey data, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
model performance. The results demonstrate that RAG substantially enhances
predictive accuracy across a range of models. Notably, the GPT-4o model
combined with balanced retrieval and cross-encoder re-ranking achieves the
highest accuracy of 80.8%, exceeding that of conventional statistical and
machine learning baselines. Furthermore, LLM-based models exhibit superior
generalization abilities relative to these baselines. Findings highlight the
critical interplay between LLM reasoning capabilities and retrieval strategies,
demonstrating the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model
capabilities to maximize the potential of LLM-based travel behavior modeling.

Motivation: 为了解释意识如何与记忆系统交互，并将其建模为数学结构。

Method: 将无意识过程建模为煤代数的拓扑范畴，将意识的内部语言定义为多模态的通用嵌入语言，使用网络经济模型与强化学习框架建模记忆信息的传递。

Abstract: We propose a novel theory of consciousness as a functor (CF) that receives
and transmits contents from unconscious memory into conscious memory. Our CF
framework can be seen as a categorial formulation of the Global Workspace
Theory proposed by Baars. CF models the ensemble of unconscious processes as a
topos category of coalgebras. The internal language of thought in CF is defined
as a Multi-modal Universal Mitchell-Benabou Language Embedding (MUMBLE). We
model the transmission of information from conscious short-term working memory
to long-term unconscious memory using our recently proposed Universal
Reinforcement Learning (URL) framework. To model the transmission of
information from unconscious long-term memory into resource-constrained
short-term memory, we propose a network economic model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在金融中的应用缺乏智能体协调、自反思能力，以及高质量后训练数据的限制。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体架构TradingGroup，包括自反思机制、动态风险管理模型和数据合成注释管道，用于更好地优化交易决策。

Result: 通过五个真实股票数据集回测显示，TradingGroup在交易策略上优于其他规则、机器学习、强化学习及现有LLM模型。

Conclusion: TradingGroup的设计在金融应用中实现了数据驱动的高效智能决策能力，并显著超越现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful
agent-based applications in finance, particularly for sentiment analysis,
financial report comprehension, and stock forecasting. However, existing
systems often lack inter-agent coordination, structured self-reflection, and
access to high-quality, domain-specific post-training data such as data from
trading activities including both market conditions and agent decisions. These
data are crucial for agents to understand the market dynamics, improve the
quality of decision-making and promote effective coordination. We introduce
TradingGroup, a multi-agent trading system designed to address these
limitations through a self-reflective architecture and an end-to-end
data-synthesis pipeline. TradingGroup consists of specialized agents for news
sentiment analysis, financial report interpretation, stock trend forecasting,
trading style adaptation, and a trading decision making agent that merges all
signals and style preferences to produce buy, sell or hold decisions.
Specifically, we design self-reflection mechanisms for the stock forecasting,
style, and decision-making agents to distill past successes and failures for
similar reasoning in analogous future scenarios and a dynamic risk-management
model to offer configurable dynamic stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. In
addition, TradingGroup embeds an automated data-synthesis and annotation
pipeline that generates high-quality post-training data for further improving
the agent performance through post-training. Our backtesting experiments across
five real-world stock datasets demonstrate TradingGroup's superior performance
over rule-based, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and existing
LLM-based trading strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的量化评估方法，用于分析极限飞盘比赛中球员的运动启动时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前团队运动研究中缺乏对球员在比赛中非标记动作启动时间的定量研究。

Method: 使用无人机拍摄比赛视频，提取球员位置数据（UltimateTrack数据集），检测球员动作启动并生成时间对比场景，最终使用计算空间控制的评价指标进行分析。

Result: 发现实际被传递给接球者的序列得分更高，高技能组的时间偏差分布更广。

Conclusion: 提出的评价指标能够客观评估团队运动中难以量化的动作启动时间。

Abstract: Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.

Result: 发现数据多样性是实现语言模型超越能力的重要因素，并提供了一个有利于未来研究的受控测试环境。

Conclusion: 揭示了语言模型超越能力的驱动因素，并搭建了一个有助于进一步研究的优化平台。

Abstract: Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.

Abstract: Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit
near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these
systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning
frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in
different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks
dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across
different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to
further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods,
tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a
comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific
discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics.
We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize
different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research
community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths,
suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning
frameworks.

Motivation: 为克服当前移动网络系统中静态控制和手动操作的局限性，推动向自适应、自主发展的智能网络方向演进。

Method: 提出AgenRAN框架，利用现代大语言模型(LLM)驱动的代理解析自然语言意图，通过层次化的分布式AI代理实现对复杂任务的分解与策略协商，同时建立自动化生成和优化代理的AI-RAN Factory。

Result: 通过在5G测试平台上的实验，表明AgenRAN可以动态地通过意图级联调节用户需求，展示了其高度灵活的网络控制能力。

Conclusion: AgenRAN通过自然语言协调取代传统的API接口，为未来6G网络的智能演化和优化奠定基础，标志着移动网络控制和适应性的重大突破。

Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable,
interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely
heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this
limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic
framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents
based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that
require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural
language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and
orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a
self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time
scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to
network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is
the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent
interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control
algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of
functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We
demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing
user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing
rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G
networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet
operator goals.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种利用GPU加速的框架，解决纯过去信号时序逻辑(STL)的性能和实用性限制问题，并实现了早期故障检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运行时监测依赖于构造基于信号时序逻辑(STL)的复杂自动机，导致性能和实用性受限，亟需更高效的方法。

Method: 通过将纯过去信号时序逻辑片段的监测转化为可用多项式时间完成的公式评估问题，结合GPU加速的矢量化跟踪检查，并对历史数据进行遗传编程学习。

Result: 相比于现有方法，该框架在关键性能指标上实现了2-10%的净提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅有效缓解了监测复杂性问题，还通过GPU加速实现了高效的早期故障检测，为实际系统监测提供新手段。

Abstract: Monitoring is a runtime verification technique that allows one to check
whether an ongoing computation of a system (partial trace) satisfies a given
formula. It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically
requires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in
the size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In
this paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring
of pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced
to trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be
performed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the
trace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for
interpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that
employs genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace
data. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在动态场景生成、智能NPC交互和自适应对手等方面展示了广阔的应用潜力，但其在游戏环境中的社会偏见和信任问题尚未深入探讨。

Method: 提出了FairGamer，这是一个专门用于评估LLMs在游戏场景中偏见的基准，包含六个任务和新指标${D_lstd}$，覆盖三大可能产生社会偏见的游戏场景。

Result: 实验显示LLMs的决策偏见会导致游戏平衡恶化（例如Grok-3的平均${D_lstd}$得分为0.431），并且这些模型对真实和虚拟内容表现出相似的社会/文化偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs的内在特性可能是其偏见的来源，这暴露了在游戏领域应用中的可靠性问题，需要进一步的研究和解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate vast application potential in video games--from dynamic scene
generation and intelligent NPC interactions to adaptive opponents--replacing or
enhancing traditional game mechanics. However, LLMs' trustworthiness in this
application has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we reveal that
the models' inherent social biases can directly damage game balance in
real-world gaming environments. To this end, we present FairGamer, the first
bias evaluation Benchmark for LLMs in video game scenarios, featuring six tasks
and a novel metrics ${D_lstd}$. It covers three key scenarios in games where
LLMs' social biases are particularly likely to manifest: Serving as Non-Player
Characters, Interacting as Competitive Opponents, and Generating Game Scenes.
FairGamer utilizes both reality-grounded and fully fictional game content,
covering a variety of video game genres. Experiments reveal: (1) Decision
biases directly cause game balance degradation, with Grok-3 (average ${D_lstd}$
score=0.431) exhibiting the most severe degradation; (2) LLMs demonstrate
isomorphic social/cultural biases toward both real and virtual world content,
suggesting their biases nature may stem from inherent model characteristics.
These findings expose critical reliability gaps in LLMs' gaming applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LLM在严格逻辑或约束下表现较弱，而LRM尽管逻辑推理能力强，但计算速度缓慢。研究旨在结合两者优点，优化推理效率和能力。

Method: 使用SOFAI-LM框架，该框架通过元认知模块协调LLM与LRM，提供针对性的迭代反馈，不需额外的模型微调。并通过快速LLM的反馈搭配适时调用LRM，改进求解效率。

Result: 在图着色和代码调试问题上的实验证明，SOFAI-LM显著提升LLM的问题解决能力，在许多场景下达到甚至超过LRM的水平，同时大幅缩短推理时间。

Conclusion: SOFAI-LM框架证明了整合快速LLM与慢速LRM可以高效且准确地解决复杂推理问题，展现了在不同领域中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various
reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint
enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are
specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come
with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address
these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI)
cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a
slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module
actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative
feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine
its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning.
Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate
that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving
capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that
match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less
time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient,
we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the
LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem
domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two
contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions,
and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM
enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while
maintaining significantly lower inference time.

Result: 通过仿真和真实环境实验验证，LLM-NAR在解决MAPF任务时远超现有的LLM方法。

Conclusion: LLM-NAR框架为提升大语言模型在MAPF任务中的性能提供了有效思路，具有较好的应用适配能力。

Abstract: The development and application of large language models (LLM) have
demonstrated that foundational models can be utilized to solve a wide array of
tasks. However, their performance in multi-agent path finding (MAPF) tasks has
been less than satisfactory, with only a few studies exploring this area. MAPF
is a complex problem requiring both planning and multi-agent coordination. To
improve the performance of LLM in MAPF tasks, we propose a novel framework,
LLM-NAR, which leverages neural algorithmic reasoners (NAR) to inform LLM for
MAPF. LLM-NAR consists of three key components: an LLM for MAPF, a pre-trained
graph neural network-based NAR, and a cross-attention mechanism. This is the
first work to propose using a neural algorithmic reasoner to integrate GNNs
with the map information for MAPF, thereby guiding LLM to achieve superior
performance. LLM-NAR can be easily adapted to various LLM models. Both
simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing LLM-based approaches in solving MAPF problems.

Abstract: Vision language model (VLM)-based mobile agents show great potential for
assisting users in performing instruction-driven tasks. However, these agents
typically struggle with personalized instructions -- those containing
ambiguous, user-specific context -- a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous research. In this paper, we define personalized
instructions and introduce PerInstruct, a novel human-annotated dataset
covering diverse personalized instructions across various mobile scenarios.
Furthermore, given the limited personalization capabilities of existing mobile
agents, we propose PerPilot, a plug-and-play framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that enables mobile agents to autonomously perceive,
understand, and execute personalized user instructions. PerPilot identifies
personalized elements and autonomously completes instructions via two
complementary approaches: memory-based retrieval and reasoning-based
exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that PerPilot effectively handles
personalized tasks with minimal user intervention and progressively improves
its performance with continued use, underscoring the importance of
personalization-aware reasoning for next-generation mobile agents. The dataset

Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
formulating and solving decision-making problems using mathematical
programming. We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent
literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve
optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review
questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics,
and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted
experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in
automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks.
Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies:
Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the
obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation
accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs' ability to parse natural
language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations
in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate
several future research directions, including structured datasets,
domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular
multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs. This paper
contributes a structured roadmap for advancing LLM capabilities in mathematical
programming.

Abstract: Imagine decision-makers uploading data and, within minutes, receiving clear,
actionable insights delivered straight to their fingertips. That is the promise
of the AI Data Scientist, an autonomous Agent powered by large language models
(LLMs) that closes the gap between evidence and action. Rather than simply
writing code or responding to prompts, it reasons through questions, tests
ideas, and delivers end-to-end insights at a pace far beyond traditional
workflows. Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent
uncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical
significance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates
these results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At
the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each
responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,
validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own
code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to
support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might

### [353] [SEAM: Semantically Equivalent Across Modalities Benchmark for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18179)
*Zhenwei Tang,Difan Jiao,Blair Yang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAM是一个评估视听语言模型(VLMs)跨模态一致性的新基准，针对等价语义的文本和视觉输入进行了比较性测试。研究发现视觉性能经常滞后于语言性能，且跨模态一致性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模态比较通常受到任务差异和信息不对称的影响，难以准确评估VLMs在表征上的一致性。该工作提出SEAM基准，旨在更公平地考察文本符号和视觉空间推理能力。

Method: 引入SEAM基准，利用四个具有现有标准化文本和视觉符号的域，构建语义等价的输入对，采用跨模态的符号系统进行严格比较，并对21种现有模型进行性能测试。

Result: 发现视觉的整体性能往往落后于语言，而两者跨模态的一致性也相对较低。错误分析显示，问题主要来自文本感知失败（如分词误差）和视觉感知失败（如幻觉现象），且结果对视觉变换基本稳健。

Conclusion: SEAM为评估和改进模态无关推理能力提供了一个受控的、语义等价的环境。

Abstract: Evaluating whether vision-language models (VLMs) reason consistently across
representations is challenging because modality comparisons are typically
confounded by task differences and asymmetric information. We introduce SEAM, a
benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that
have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct
notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text
pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the
textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21
contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision
frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems
containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is
relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception
failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures
that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to
visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent
setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.

TL;DR: ST-Raptor通过引入树状结构模型和操作引导LLM实现对半结构化表格的自然语言问答任务，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂的半结构化表格布局和准确回答相关问题时存在信息丢失及理解能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出ST-Raptor框架，包括HO-Tree结构模型、基本树操作集以及两阶段验证机制，同时提供了一个新的基准数据集SSTQA。

Result: ST-Raptor在答题准确性上优于九个基线模型，提升幅度可达20%。

Conclusion: ST-Raptor提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，可有效自动化对复杂半结构化表格的理解和问答任务。

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g.,
financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve
flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells).
These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and
answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To
automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First,
methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured
ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like
NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of
semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To
this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured
table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the
Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures
complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for
constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to
guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor
decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree
operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate
pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:
forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward
validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from
predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of
764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that
ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code
is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新框架，以认知科学为基础，分析大语言模型(LLMs)的内部架构及认知过程，发现模型技能分布部分类似于鸟类和小型哺乳动物的认知组织。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已广泛应用于科学、工程和社会领域，但其底层机制和认知过程仍难以理解，因此需要新的方法弥补此研究空白。

Method: 采用生物学中对认知出现的研究方法，开发基于网络的框架，将认知技能、LLMs架构和数据集联系起来，分析模型模块的技能分布及其与生物认知系统的异同。

Result: 发现LLMs中的模块分布和技能模式部分反映了鸟类和小型哺乳动物的分布式但互联的认知组织，同时指出与生物系统不同，LLMs的技能获取更依赖于动态的跨区域交互和神经可塑性。

Conclusion: 基于该框架研究可为LLMs的解释性提供新视角，并建议在微调策略中利用分布式学习动态，而非僵化的模块干预，以提高效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped our world with significant
advancements in science, engineering, and society through applications ranging
from scientific discoveries and medical diagnostics to Chatbots. Despite their
ubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within
billions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture
and cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by
adopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and
developing a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM
architectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model
analysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that
while LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in
specific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose
emergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected
cognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical
results highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill
acquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions
and neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine
learning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and
suggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed
learning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions.

Method: 通过训练一系列具有系统变量的自监督视觉变换器（DINOv3），使用fMRI和MEG测量大脑对图像的表征，评估其与模型的相似性，同时使用三种指标：总体表示相似性、拓扑组织及时间动态，解析不同影响因素。

Result: 发现模型大小、训练量、图像类型均独立和交互地影响大脑模型相似性，各自对脑表征相似性、组织及动态都有显著作用。最大DINOv3模型与以人为中心图像的训练达到最高相似性，并且模型的表示与大脑不同区域表示在时间上具有渐进对齐的特性。

Conclusion: AI模型类人脑表征的发展受结构和经验的影响，与人体皮层的发育特性相对应。研究为理解人类大脑如何构建其视觉表征提供了框架，同时揭示AI大脑相似性中的关键要素。

Abstract: Many AI models trained on natural images develop representations that
resemble those of the human brain. However, the factors that drive this
brain-model similarity remain poorly understood. To disentangle how the model,
training and data independently lead a neural network to develop brain-like
representations, we trained a family of self-supervised vision transformers
(DINOv3) that systematically varied these different factors. We compare their
representations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI
and MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess
the brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall
representational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.
We show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -
independently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.
In particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric
images reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like
representations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:
models first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and
only align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with
considerably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed
by both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the
representations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with
the cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least
myelination, and slowest timescales. Overall, these findings disentangle the
interplay between architecture and experience in shaping how artificial neural
networks come to see the world as humans do, thus offering a promising
framework to understand how the human brain comes to represent its visual
world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了解决马尔科夫决策问题(MDPs)中“布莱克韦尔最优”（Blackwell optimality）的计算问题，提出了适用于确定性与一般MDPs的高效算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MDP的最优标准（如折扣和平均回报）在决策中存在局限性：折扣最优可能过分注重短期回报，而平均最优则依赖较强的结构假设。本文关注布莱克韦尔最优标准，其兼顾了折扣和平均回报的优点，但实现上计算复杂度高。

Method: 提出了一种基于$1$附近有理函数排序的计算程序，通过用符号操作替代数值评估对现有算法进行改进，提出了适用于确定性和一般MDPs的多种高阶算法。

Result: 针对确定性MDPs，提出了首个强多项式时间算法；针对一般MDPs，提出首个亚指数时间算法；并推广了多个策略迭代算法，将折扣标准的上界拓展至布莱克韦尔标准。

Conclusion: 本文通过改进算法显著提高了计算布莱克韦尔最优策略的效率，对理论研究和实际决策具有重要意义。

Abstract: Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for
modelling sequential decision-making across diverse domains, guided by
optimality criteria such as discounted and average rewards. However, these
criteria have inherent limitations: discounted optimality may overly prioritise
short-term rewards, while average optimality relies on strong structural
assumptions. Blackwell optimality addresses these challenges, offering a robust
and comprehensive criterion that ensures optimality under both discounted and
average reward frameworks. Despite its theoretical appeal, existing algorithms
for computing Blackwell Optimal (BO) policies are computationally expensive or
hard to implement.
  In this paper we describe procedures for computing BO policies using an
ordering of rational functions in the vicinity of $1$. We adapt
state-of-the-art algorithms for deterministic and general MDPs, replacing
numerical evaluations with symbolic operations on rational functions to derive
bounds independent of bit complexity. For deterministic MDPs, we give the first
strongly polynomial-time algorithms for computing BO policies, and for general
MDPs we obtain the first subexponential-time algorithm. We further generalise
several policy iteration algorithms, extending the best known upper bounds from
the discounted to the Blackwell criterion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LSTM网络和Ornstein-Uhlenbeck噪声的量子启发深度强化学习框架，用于解决纺织工业中的裁剪顺序规划问题，可实现高达13%的面料成本节约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于静态启发和目录估算的方法无法满足动态生产环境的需求，导致解决方案次优且浪费增加。

Method: 结合量子启发概率表示的深度强化学习框架，将LSTM网络用于捕获时序依赖性，并使用OU噪声促进平滑探索和快速收敛。

Result: 经过1000次训练，取得了平均奖励为0.81，预测损失降至0.15，面料成本节约可达13%，并且具有低波动性和稳定收敛性。

Conclusion: 尽管简化了模拟模型，该框架展示了显著提高制造效率的潜力，为未来裁剪顺序规划优化的创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: Cut order planning (COP) is a critical challenge in the textile industry,
directly impacting fabric utilization and production costs. Conventional
methods based on static heuristics and catalog-based estimations often struggle
to adapt to dynamic production environments, resulting in suboptimal solutions
and increased waste. In response, we propose a novel Quantum-Inspired Deep
Reinforcement Learning (QI-DRL) framework that integrates Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) networks with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This hybrid approach is
designed to explicitly address key research questions regarding the benefits of
quantum-inspired probabilistic representations, the role of LSTM-based memory
in capturing sequential dependencies, and the effectiveness of OU noise in
facilitating smooth exploration and faster convergence. Extensive training over
1000 episodes demonstrates robust performance, with an average reward of 0.81
(-+0.03) and a steady decrease in prediction loss to 0.15 (-+0.02). A
comparative analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves fabric cost
savings of up to 13% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, statistical
evaluations indicate low variability and stable convergence. Despite the fact
that the simulation model makes several simplifying assumptions, these
promising results underscore the potential of the scalable and adaptive
framework to enhance manufacturing efficiency and pave the way for future
innovations in COP optimization.

Motivation: 现有多流设计复杂的生成模型容易导致过拟合，需要更简单高效的体系建模方法。

Method: CrystalDiT使用单一统一变压器，同时结合基于元素周期表的原子表示和均衡训练策略，简化架构设计。

Result: 在MP-20数据集上，CrystalDiT实现了9.62%的SUN率（稳定、独特、新颖），显著优于FlowMM（4.38%）和MatterGen（3.42%）。

Conclusion: 简单设计的架构在数据有限的科学领域更具有效性，并可取代复杂的生成对抗模型以提高材料发现的性能。

Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure
generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend
of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs,
CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive
bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent
system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a
balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique,
Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including
FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28%
unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates,
demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than
complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited
scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform
sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了两种针对数据流的异常检测方法：DyCF和DyCG，分别利用Christoffel函数的逼近理论和其增长性质，旨在解决非平稳分布和数据量增长带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据采集方法的广泛渗透，识别数据流中的异常以保持数据质量和故障检测显得尤为重要。然而，数据流的非平稳性和数据量持续增加带来了挑战，同时现有方法因参数化不直观而表现出局限性。

Method: 提出了两种基于Christoffel函数的新方法：1.DyCF依赖逼近理论和正交多项式的Christoffel函数。2.DyCG利用Christoffel函数的增长性质，无需参数调整。两者均构建在明确的代数框架中，旨在解决低维问题及无额外内存成本地维护数据历史。

Result: 实验展示，DyCF在执行时间和内存使用上优于需调参的方法，而DyCG虽表现较弱，但具备完全无需调参的显著优点。

Conclusion: DyCF和DyCG提供了有效处理数据流异常检测的解决方案，分别在性能和操作简便性上具有优势，并在综合比较中展现了优越表现。

Abstract: Outlier detection holds significant importance in the realm of data mining,
particularly with the growing pervasiveness of data acquisition methods. The
ability to identify outliers in data streams is essential for maintaining data
quality and detecting faults. However, dealing with data streams presents
challenges due to the non-stationary nature of distributions and the
ever-increasing data volume. While numerous methods have been proposed to
tackle this challenge, a common drawback is the lack of straightforward
parameterization in many of them. This article introduces two novel methods:
DyCF and DyCG. DyCF leverages the Christoffel function from the theory of
approximation and orthogonal polynomials. Conversely, DyCG capitalizes on the
growth properties of the Christoffel function, eliminating the need for tuning
parameters. Both approaches are firmly rooted in a well-defined algebraic
framework, meeting crucial demands for data stream processing, with a specific
focus on addressing low-dimensional aspects and maintaining data history
without memory cost. A comprehensive comparison between DyCF, DyCG, and
state-of-the-art methods is presented, using both synthetic and real industrial
data streams. The results show that DyCF outperforms fine-tuning methods,
offering superior performance in terms of execution time and memory usage. DyCG
performs less well, but has the considerable advantage of requiring no tuning
at all.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖历史轨迹数据，未充分利用未来时空背景信息。

Method: 引入STRelay框架，将未来时空背景建模为中继信息，并与基础模型历史编码结合，实现多任务学习。

Result: 在4个数据集上与4种基础模型集成，预测性能提升3.19%-11.56%。

Conclusion: STRelay框架能有效提升位置预测性能，尤其在不常规的活动模式中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility modeling,
enabling applications like travel planning and urban mobility management.
Existing methods mainly rely on historical spatiotemporal trajectory data to
train sequence models that directly forecast future locations. However, they
often overlook the importance of the future spatiotemporal contexts, which are
highly informative for the future locations. For example, knowing how much time
and distance a user will travel could serve as a critical clue for predicting
the user's next location. Against this background, we propose \textbf{STRelay},
a universal \textbf{\underline{S}}patio\textbf{\underline{T}}emporal
\textbf{\underline{Relay}}ing framework explicitly modeling the future
spatiotemporal context given a human trajectory, to boost the performance of
different location prediction models. Specifically, STRelay models future
spatiotemporal contexts in a relaying manner, which is subsequently integrated
with the encoded historical representation from a base location prediction
model, enabling multi-task learning by simultaneously predicting the next time
interval, next moving distance interval, and finally the next location. We
evaluate STRelay integrated with four state-of-the-art location prediction base
models on four real-world trajectory datasets. Results demonstrate that STRelay
consistently improves prediction performance across all cases by
3.19\%-11.56\%. Additionally, we find that the future spatiotemporal contexts
are particularly helpful for entertainment-related locations and also for user
groups who prefer traveling longer distances. The performance gain on such
non-daily-routine activities, which often suffer from higher uncertainty, is
indeed complementary to the base location prediction models that often excel at
modeling regular daily routine patterns.

Conclusion: RAST框架有效地通过结合检索增强机制与时空建模解决交通预测中的关键难题，为交通预测提供了一个新颖的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a cornerstone of modern intelligent transportation
systems and a critical task in spatio-temporal forecasting. Although advanced
Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have
achieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:
(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal
dependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal
points due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates
retrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these
challenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder
and Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and
construct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval
Store and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;
and 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained
STGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world
traffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST
achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have been extensively applied across various domains, where
memory stands out as one of their most essential capabilities. Previous memory
mechanisms of LLM-based agents are manually predefined by human experts,
leading to higher labor costs and suboptimal performance. In addition, these
methods overlook the memory cycle effect in interactive scenarios, which is
critical to optimizing LLM-based agents for specific environments. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose to optimize LLM-based agents with
an adaptive and data-driven memory framework by modeling memory cycles.
Specifically, we design an MoE gate function to facilitate memory retrieval,
propose a learnable aggregation process to improve memory utilization, and
develop task-specific reflection to adapt memory storage. Our memory framework
empowers LLM-based agents to learn how to memorize information effectively in
specific environments, with both off-policy and on-policy optimization. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct
comprehensive experiments across multiple aspects. To benefit the research
community in this area, we release our project at

Abstract: Many subsurface formations, including some of those under consideration for
large-scale geological carbon storage, include extensive faults that can
strongly impact fluid flow. In this study, we develop a new recurrent
transformer U-Net surrogate model to provide very fast predictions for pressure
and CO2 saturation in realistic faulted subsurface aquifer systems. The
geomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),
surrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.
The faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The
heterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by
hierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,
mean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell
properties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also
treated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)
4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is
more accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains
accuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is
then used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical
Markov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different
monitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed
data collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true
models. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction
achieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D
saturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring
pressure and saturation in all three aquifers.

Abstract: The persistent challenge of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks has
motivated extensive research in continual learning . This work presents a novel
continual learning framework that integrates Fisher-weighted asymmetric
regularization of parameter variances within a variational learning paradigm.
Our method dynamically modulates regularization intensity according to
parameter uncertainty, achieving enhanced stability and performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks including
SplitMNIST, PermutedMNIST, and SplitFashionMNIST demonstrate substantial
improvements over existing approaches such as Variational Continual Learning
and Elastic Weight Consolidation . The asymmetric variance penalty mechanism
proves particularly effective in maintaining knowledge across sequential tasks
while improving model accuracy. Experimental results show our approach not only
boosts immediate task performance but also significantly mitigates knowledge
degradation over time, effectively addressing the fundamental challenge of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks

Motivation: 传统图移位算子在捕捉非相邻节点的依赖关系方面存在局限，难以充分表示复杂的图结构。

Method: 引入统一的扩展矩阵（UEM）框架，结合扩展邻接矩阵和统一图表示矩阵，通过参数化设计灵活适配不同图结构；提出基于UEM的图傅里叶变换（UEM-GFT），自适应调节频谱特性。

Result: 实验表明，在合成和实际数据集上的异常检测任务中，UEM-GFT在多种网络拓扑结构下均优于传统GSO方法。

Conclusion: UEM提供了灵活和高效的图处理工具，通过更高级别的频谱调整能力提高了信号处理性能，在异常检测等应用中具有明显优势。

Abstract: Graph signal processing has become an essential tool for analyzing data
structured on irregular domains. While conventional graph shift operators
(GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in
modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to
represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the
extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through
parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph
structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of
the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue
monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier
transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties
to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based
methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across
varying network topologies.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to
continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without
forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However,
this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting
of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity
Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN
explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a
fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order
Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific
features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation
stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared
across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a
multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained
knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting
and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a
decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision
boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP
benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN
achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to
state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 通过将统计推理与现代基础模型结合，可以显著提升时间序列应用的准确性、可靠性和可解释性，展现出实际场景中的潜力与应用值。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) such as Lag-Llama, TimeGPT, Chronos,
MOMENT, UniTS, and TimesFM have shown strong generalization and zero-shot
capabilities for time series forecasting, anomaly detection, classification,
and imputation. Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from
variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when
deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of
statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including
bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval
construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to
improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load
Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids
consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons.
Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap
aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects
systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal
coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results
indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models
yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for
real-world time series applications.

Abstract: From large language models to multi-modal agents, Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) now underpins state-of-the-art systems. Despite their varied
architectures, many share a common foundation in probabilistic latent variable
models (PLVMs), where hidden variables explain observed data for density
estimation, latent reasoning, and structured inference. This paper presents a
unified perspective by framing both classical and modern generative methods
within the PLVM paradigm. We trace the progression from classical flat models
such as probabilistic PCA, Gaussian mixture models, latent class analysis, item
response theory, and latent Dirichlet allocation, through their sequential
extensions including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian HMMs, and Linear Dynamical
Systems, to contemporary deep architectures: Variational Autoencoders as Deep
PLVMs, Normalizing Flows as Tractable PLVMs, Diffusion Models as Sequential
PLVMs, Autoregressive Models as Explicit Generative Models, and Generative
Adversarial Networks as Implicit PLVMs. Viewing these architectures under a
common probabilistic taxonomy reveals shared principles, distinct inference
strategies, and the representational trade-offs that shape their strengths. We
offer a conceptual roadmap that consolidates generative AI's theoretical
foundations, clarifies methodological lineages, and guides future innovation by
grounding emerging architectures in their probabilistic heritage.

Conclusion: AdapSNE在提高数据采样质量和节省边缘设备资源方面表现出色，为DNN的边缘设备训练提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted
increasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as
domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training
typically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on
edge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To
address this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),
named NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting
dimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling
in the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based
methods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,
NMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method
and the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the
emergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,
target perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and
leading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of
examplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose
AdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided
optimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative
training samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the
edge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and
entropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and
time-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.

Conclusion: LatentFlow框架通过分离流场动态空间编码和壁面压力时间测量，提供了一种可扩展且可靠的流场重建方案。

Abstract: Acquiring temporally high-frequency and spatially high-resolution turbulent
wake flow fields in particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments remains a
significant challenge due to hardware limitations and measurement noise. In
contrast, temporal high-frequency measurements of spatially sparse wall
pressure are more readily accessible in wind tunnel experiments. In this study,
we propose a novel cross-modal temporal upscaling framework, LatentFlow, which
reconstructs high-frequency (512 Hz) turbulent wake flow fields by fusing
synchronized low-frequency (15 Hz) flow field and pressure data during
training, and high-frequency wall pressure signals during inference. The first
stage involves training a pressure-conditioned $\beta$-variation autoencoder
($p$C-$\beta$-VAE) to learn a compact latent representation that captures the
intrinsic dynamics of the wake flow. A secondary network maps synchronized
low-frequency wall pressure signals into the latent space, enabling
reconstruction of the wake flow field solely from sparse wall pressure. Once
trained, the model utilizes high-frequency, spatially sparse wall pressure
inputs to generate corresponding high-frequency flow fields via the
$p$C-$\beta$-VAE decoder. By decoupling the spatial encoding of flow dynamics
from temporal pressure measurements, LatentFlow provides a scalable and robust
solution for reconstructing high-frequency turbulent wake flows in
data-constrained experimental settings.

Abstract: We propose HiCL, a novel hippocampal-inspired dual-memory continual learning
architecture designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by using elements
inspired by the hippocampal circuitry. Our system encodes inputs through a
grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate
gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are
maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is
dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs
are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized
sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed
through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet
mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable
task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the
model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks.
Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted
by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of
stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on
standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art
results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

Conclusion: 该方法为支持健康服务提供者和远程病患监测系统提供了一种实用且高效的工具，在心率动态建模中具有明显优势。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, remote patient
monitoring (RPM) emerged as a promising solution for managing heart failure.
However, the heart rate can fluctuate significantly due to various factors, and
without correlating it to the patient's actual physical activity, it becomes
difficult to assess whether changes are significant. Although Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models may enhance the accuracy and contextual understanding
of remote heart rate monitoring, the integration of activity data is still
rarely addressed. In this paper, we propose a Transformer model combined with a
Laplace diffusion technique to model heart rate fluctuations driven by physical
activity of the patient. Unlike prior models that treat activity as secondary,
our approach conditions the entire modeling process on activity context using
specialized embeddings and attention mechanisms to prioritize activity specific
historical patents. The model captures both long-term patterns and
activity-specific heart rate dynamics by incorporating contextualized
embeddings and dedicated encoder. The Transformer model was validated on a
real-world dataset collected from 29 patients over a 4-month period.
Experimental results show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 43% reduction in mean absolute error compared to the
considered baseline models. Moreover, the coefficient of determination R2 is
0.97 indicating the model predicted heart rate is in strong agreement with
actual heart rate values. These findings suggest that the proposed model is a
practical and effective tool for supporting both healthcare providers and
remote patient monitoring systems.

Abstract: The expansion of machine learning into dynamic environments presents
challenges in handling open-world problems where label shift, covariate shift,
and unknown classes emerge. Post-training methods have been explored to address
these challenges, adapting models to newly emerging data. However, these
methods struggle when the initial pre-training is performed on class-imbalanced
datasets, limiting generalization to minority classes. To address this, we
propose a method that effectively handles open-world problems even when
pre-training is conducted on imbalanced data. Our contrastive-based
pre-training approach enhances classification performance, particularly for
underrepresented classes. Our post-training mechanism generates reliable
pseudo-labels, improving model robustness against open-world problems. We also
introduce selective activation criteria to optimize the post-training process,
reducing unnecessary computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adaptation techniques in both
accuracy and efficiency across diverse open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Transformer architecture gradually dominates the LLM field. Recent advances
in training optimization for Transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on architectural modifications or optimizer adjustments.
However, these approaches lack systematic optimization of weight patterns
during training. Weight pattern refers to the distribution and relative
magnitudes of weight parameters in a neural network. To address this issue, we
propose a Weight Scaling method called WISCA to enhance training efficiency and
model quality by strategically improving neural network weight patterns without
changing network structures. By rescaling weights while preserving model
outputs, WISCA indirectly optimizes the model's training trajectory.
Experiments demonstrate that WISCA significantly improves convergence quality
(measured by generalization capability and loss reduction), particularly in
LLMs with Grouped Query Attention (GQA) architectures and LoRA fine-tuning
tasks. Empirical results show 5.6% average improvement on zero-shot validation
tasks and 2.12% average reduction in training perplexity across multiple

Abstract: Many existing studies have achieved significant improvements in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR), while the enhancement of reasoning abilities in
small language models (SLMs) has not yet been sufficiently explored. Combining
distilled data from larger models with RLVR on small models themselves is a
natural approach, but it still faces various challenges and issues. Therefore,
we propose \textit{\underline{R}}ecall-\textit{\underline{E}}xtend
\textit{\underline{D}}ynamics(RED): Enhancing Small Language Models through
Controlled Exploration and Refined Offline Integration. In this paper, we
explore the perspective of varying exploration spaces, balancing offline
distillation with online reinforcement learning. Simultaneously, we
specifically design and optimize for the insertion problem within offline data.
By monitoring the ratio of entropy changes in the model concerning offline and
online data, we regulate the weight of offline-SFT, thereby addressing the
issues of insufficient exploration space in small models and the redundancy and
complexity during the distillation process. Furthermore, to tackle the
distribution discrepancies between offline data and the current policy, we
design a sample-accuracy-based policy shift mechanism that dynamically chooses
between imitating offline distilled data and learning from its own policy.

Motivation: 为了解决现有低秩分解方法在压缩大语言模型时造成功能性能损失的问题。

Method: 引入了一种包含两个部分的新方法CALR：一是采用SVD对模型进行初步压缩；二是通过一个可学习的低秩校正模块训练以弥补功能残差。

Result: 实验表明，CALR可以减少参数量26.93%-51.77%，同时保留59.45%-90.42%的原始性能，并优于多种现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将功能信息损失视为可学习信号，CALR成为一种有效的模型压缩方法，从而使更小、更高效的大语言模型成为可能，提升其实际应用的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques
are essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained
environments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating
weight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix
reconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's
functional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing
methods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during
compression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank
Decomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a
primary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank
corrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual
error. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and
Llama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to
51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,
consistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows
that treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly
effective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of
significantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and
practical deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent
transportation systems. This paper presents a novel deep learning model, the
Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph Attention Network (STGAtt). By leveraging a
unified graph representation and an attention mechanism, STGAtt effectively
captures complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Unlike methods relying on
separate spatial and temporal dependency modeling modules, STGAtt directly
models correlations within a Spatial-Temporal Unified Graph, dynamically
weighing connections across both dimensions. To further enhance its
capabilities, STGAtt partitions traffic flow observation signal into
neighborhood subsets and employs a novel exchanging mechanism, enabling
effective capture of both short-range and long-range correlations. Extensive
experiments on the PEMS-BAY and SHMetro datasets demonstrate STGAtt's superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various prediction
horizons. Visualization of attention weights confirms STGAtt's ability to adapt
to dynamic traffic patterns and capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
its potential for real-world traffic flow forecasting applications.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of uncertainty in neural network predictions remains
a central challenge for scientific applications involving high-dimensional,
correlated data. While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic
uncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that
preserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this
work, we present a framework for training neural networks with a
multidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions
over outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.
Our approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means
and covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We
leverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network
training and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization
strategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between
image-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the
super-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional
loss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit
correlation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all
without disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a
surface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to
uncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.

Abstract: Traditional neural embeddings represent concepts as points, excelling at
similarity but struggling with higher-level reasoning and asymmetric
relationships. We introduce a novel paradigm: embedding concepts as linear
subspaces. This framework inherently models generality via subspace
dimensionality and hierarchy through subspace inclusion. It naturally supports
set-theoretic operations like intersection (conjunction), linear sum
(disjunction) and orthogonal complements (negations), aligning with classical
formal semantics. To enable differentiable learning, we propose a smooth
relaxation of orthogonal projection operators, allowing for the learning of
both subspace orientation and dimension. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
results in reconstruction and link prediction on WordNet. Furthermore, on
natural language inference benchmarks, our subspace embeddings surpass
bi-encoder baselines, offering an interpretable formulation of entailment that
is both geometrically grounded and amenable to logical operations.

Motivation: 研究动机是通过结合深度学习与微分方程理论，提供一种新颖的方法来求解具有复杂动态行为的非线性偏微分方程，从而提升传统数值计算和符号计算的能力。

Conclusion: AENNM方法是一种新型的求解非线性偏微分方程的框架，它融入人工智能与数学理论，并展现出广泛的科学与工程应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we firstly propose an auxiliary equation neural networks
method (AENNM), an innovative analytical method that integrates neural networks
(NNs) models with the auxiliary equation method to obtain exact solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations (NLPDEs). A key novelty of this method
is the introduction of a novel activation function derived from the solutions
of the Riccati equation, establishing a new mathematical link between
differential equations theory and deep learning. By combining the strong
approximation capability of NNs with the high precision of symbolic
computation, AENNM significantly enhances computational efficiency and
accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the AENNM in solving NLPDEs,
three numerical examples are investigated, including the nonlinear evolution
equation, the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation, and the (2+1)-dimensional
Boussinesq equation. Furthermore, some new trial functions are constructed by
setting specific activation functions within the "2-2-2-1" and "3-2-2-1" NNs
models. By embedding the auxiliary equation method into the NNs framework, we
derive previously unreported solutions. The exact analytical solutions are
expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, and
rational functions. Finally, three-dimensional plots, contour plots, and
density plots are presented to illustrate the dynamic characteristics of the
obtained solutions. This research provides a novel methodological framework for
addressing NLPDEs, with broad applicability across scientific and engineering
fields.

Motivation: 传统的深度学习优化方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，而分布鲁棒优化（DRO）则根据样本重要性分配权重，但目前的 DRO 方法与现代深度学习实践脱节。

Method: 文章设计了一种改进的自适应分布鲁棒优化目标，提出了名为 ALSO 的算法，允许对样本组赋权，并证明其在非凸目标下的收敛性。

Result: 通过对各种深度学习任务的实证评估，ALSO 在性能上优于传统优化器和现有的 DRO 方法。

Conclusion: ALSO 在各类深度学习任务中表现良好，并且成功解决了现代深度学习优化器与 DRO 方法之间的差距，为样本组赋权提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training
samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns
importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists
between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity
and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate
superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should
allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of
objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge
this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer
$\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can
handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our
proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL
models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular
DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional
optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Abstract: Lyapunov functions are fundamental to establishing the stability of Markovian
models, yet their construction typically demands substantial creativity and
analytical effort. In this paper, we show that deep learning can automate this
process by training neural networks to satisfy integral equations derived from
first-transition analysis. Beyond stability analysis, our approach can be
adapted to solve Poisson's equation and estimate stationary distributions.
While neural networks are inherently function approximators on compact domains,
it turns out that our approach remains effective when applied to Markov chains
on non-compact state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
methodology through several examples from queueing theory and beyond.

Conclusion: 小模型可以支撑大模型，实现高效和安全的提示优化，WST为提示工程提供了一个可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a challenging task for many
applications. We introduce Weak-to-Strong Transfer (WST), an automatic prompt
engineering framework where a small "Teacher" model generates instructions that
enhance the performance of a much larger "Student" model. Unlike prior work,
WST requires only a weak teacher, making it efficient and broadly applicable in
settings where large models are closed-source or difficult to fine-tune. Using
reinforcement learning, the Teacher Model's instructions are iteratively
improved based on the Student Model's outcomes, yielding substantial gains
across reasoning (MATH-500, GSM8K) and alignment (HH-RLHF) benchmarks - 98% on
MATH-500 and 134% on HH-RLHF - and surpassing baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and
Llama-70B. These results demonstrate that small models can reliably scaffold
larger ones, unlocking latent capabilities while avoiding misleading prompts
that stronger teachers may introduce, establishing WST as a scalable solution
for efficient and safe LLM prompt refinement.

Conclusion: 模型深度和循环结构等因素对提升多步推理能力至关重要，适当的设计可以显著改善推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability of large language models, yet understanding
how they learn and perform multi-step reasoning remains an open problem. In
this study, we explore how different architectures and training methods affect
model multi-step reasoning capabilities within a cellular automata framework.
By training on state sequences generated with random Boolean functions for
random initial conditions to exclude memorization, we demonstrate that most
neural architectures learn to abstract the underlying rules. While models
achieve high accuracy in next-state prediction, their performance declines
sharply if multi-step reasoning is required. We confirm that increasing model
depth plays a crucial role for sequential computations. We demonstrate that an
extension of the effective model depth with recurrence, memory, and test-time
compute scaling substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了FAIRWELL在多模态预测中的有效性和优势，为公平性和性能折衷提供了新视角。

Abstract: Early efforts on leveraging self-supervised learning (SSL) to improve machine
learning (ML) fairness has proven promising. However, such an approach has yet
to be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a
multimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information
that can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we
propose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via
the following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance
regularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance
on the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,
which ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the
covariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected
attribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain
subject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal
prediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world
heterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain
different modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our
findings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with
minimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on
the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速GPU加速设计DR-CircuitGNN，用于在EDA相关电路图数据集上加速HGNN的训练，实现了显著的速度提升，并对比现有方法具备显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电路设计的日益复杂，图神经网络（GNN）被应用于解决EDA设计的难题。然而传统GNN无法完全捕获EDA设计复杂性，而异构图神经网络（HGNN）虽更适合表达EDA电路图，但计算复杂度高，形成性能瓶颈，因此需要优化加速方法。

Conclusion: 本文提升了HGNN在EDA场景下的训练效率，有效平衡了表示能力与计算复杂度，为EDA领域的图神经网络应用提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of integrated circuit design have led to
increased challenges in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as
circuits can be naturally represented as graphs. While GNNs offer a foundation
for circuit analysis, they often fail to capture the full complexity of EDA
designs. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA
circuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric
features. However, the improved representation capability comes at the cost of
even higher computational complexity and processing cost due to their serial
module-wise message-passing scheme, creating a significant performance
bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design
by leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels
during heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on
EDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose
a parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by
concurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU
initialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams. Our
experiments show that on three representative CircuitNet designs (small,
medium, large), the proposed method can achieve up to 3.51x and 4.09x speedup
compared to the SOTA for forward and backward propagation, respectively. On
full-size CircuitNet and sampled Mini-CircuitNet, our parallel design enables
up to 2.71x speed up over the official DGL implementation cuSPARSE with
negligible impact on correlation scores and error rates.

Abstract: Inferring temporal interaction graphs and higher-order structure from neural
signals is a key problem in building generative models for systems
neuroscience. Foundation models for large-scale neural data represent shared
latent structures of neural signals. However, extracting interpretable latent
graph representations in foundation models remains challenging and unsolved.
Here we explore latent graph learning in generative models of neural signals.
By testing against numerical simulations of neural circuits with known
ground-truth connectivity, we evaluate several hypotheses for explaining
learned model weights. We discover modest alignment between extracted network
representations and the underlying directed graphs and strong alignment in the
co-input graph representations. These findings motivate paths towards
incorporating graph-based geometric constraints in the construction of
large-scale foundation models for neural data.

Motivation: 量化是一种针对资源受限环境中部署LLMs的实际解决方案，但量化对模型内部表示的影响尚未充分研究。本研究旨在探索量化模型的可靠性，填补这一空白。

Method: 本文采用多种可解释性技术，分析了多种LLMs在4-bit和8-bit量化下的模型和神经元行为变化，包括模型校准、神经元激活分布和重要性贡献等方面的影响。

Result: 结果显示，量化对模型校准的整体影响较小；无论是否量化，数据集上的死神经元数量保持一致；较小的全精度模型显示出较少的重要神经元，而较大的模型则相反（除Llama-2-7B外）；量化对神经元冗余的影响因模型而异。

Conclusion: 总体而言，尽管量化的影响依不同模型和任务有所不同，但未发现显著变化能够妨碍量化作为可靠模型压缩技术的应用。

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in
resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal
representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability
of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability
techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior.
We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings
reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.
Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,
those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent
regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we
observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons,
whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The
effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our
findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks,
however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of
quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

Conclusion: Anchor-MoE理论与实践结合紧密，可以在处理回归任务中取得优异性能，是解决不确定性问题的一种有效工具。

Abstract: Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.
We present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles
both probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned
gradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf
point regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected
into a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and
a soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network
experts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive
variance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint
calibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point
accuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\"older smooth regression function of
order~$\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded
overlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate
$O\!\big(N^{-2\alpha/(2\alpha+d)}\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test
generalization gap scales as
$\widetilde{O}\!\Big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$
and scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,
$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is
absorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous
$\widetilde{O}\!\big(\sqrt{(\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\big)$ scaling holds for the test
NLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE
consistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;
on several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression
results on our benchmark suite. Code is available at

Conclusion: UPN为连续时间建模引入了一种新颖的方法，能够处理不规则采样的观测，同时提供通用且高效的不确定性量化。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uncertainty Propagation Network (UPN), a novel family
of neural differential equations that naturally incorporate uncertainty
quantification into continuous-time modeling. Unlike existing neural ODEs that
predict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution
and its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations
for mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates
uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by
solving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling
state-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation
adapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled
uncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations
naturally. Experimental results demonstrate UPN's effectiveness across multiple
domains: continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with uncertainty quantification,
time-series forecasting with well-calibrated confidence intervals, and robust
trajectory prediction in both stable and chaotic dynamical systems.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) hold a key position in machine
learning on graphs, but they struggle with unintended behaviors, such as
over-smoothing and over-squashing, due to irregular data structures. The
observation and formulation of these limitations have become foundational in
constructing more informative graph representations. In this paper, we delve
into the limitations of MPNNs, focusing on aspects that have previously been
overlooked. Our observations reveal that even within a single layer, the
information specific to an individual node can become significantly diluted. To
delve into this phenomenon in depth, we present the concept of Over-dilution
and formulate it with two dilution factors: intra-node dilution for
attribute-level and inter-node dilution for node-level representations. We also
introduce a transformer-based solution that alleviates over-dilution and
complements existing node embedding methods like MPNNs. Our findings provide
new insights and contribute to the development of informative representations.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing relies heavily on fusion welding processes, including
gas metal arc welding (GMAW). Despite significant advances in machine
learning-based quality prediction, current models exhibit critical limitations
when confronted with the inherent distribution shifts that occur in dynamic
manufacturing environments. In this work, we extend the VQ-VAE Transformer
architecture - previously demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in weld
quality prediction - by leveraging its autoregressive loss as a reliable
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanism. Our approach exhibits superior
performance compared to conventional reconstruction methods, embedding
error-based techniques, and other established baselines. By integrating OOD
detection with continual learning strategies, we optimize model adaptation,
triggering updates only when necessary and thereby minimizing costly labeling
requirements. We introduce a novel quantitative metric that simultaneously
evaluates OOD detection capability while interpreting in-distribution
performance. Experimental validation in real-world welding scenarios
demonstrates that our framework effectively maintains robust quality prediction
capabilities across significant distribution shifts, addressing critical
challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments where process parameters
frequently change. This research makes a substantial contribution to applied
artificial intelligence by providing an explainable and at the same time
adaptive solution for quality assurance in dynamic manufacturing processes - a
crucial step towards robust, practical AI systems in the industrial
environment.

Abstract: Industrial chain plays an increasingly important role in the sustainable
development of national economy. However, as a typical complex network,
data-driven deep learning is still in its infancy in describing and analyzing
the resilience of complex networks, and its core is the lack of a theoretical
framework to describe the system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
physically informative neural symbolic approach to describe the evolutionary
dynamics of complex networks for resilient prediction. The core idea is to
learn the dynamics of the activity state of physical entities and integrate it
into the multi-layer spatiotemporal co-evolution network, and use the physical
information method to realize the joint learning of physical symbol dynamics
and spatiotemporal co-evolution topology, so as to predict the industrial chain
resilience. The experimental results show that the model can obtain better
results and predict the elasticity of the industry chain more accurately and
effectively, which has certain practical significance for the development of
the industry.

Motivation: 传统方法中，基于PDE求解的模型计算成本高但可解释性强，而数据驱动的模型成本低却缺乏解释能力，作者希望提出一种方法，同时兼具高效性和可解释性。

Method: 论文基于强对比展开(SCE)公式，提出神经对比展开(NCE)模型，从结构属性数据中学习PDE核，并且无需PDE解场的测量，降低了数据获取难度。

Conclusion: NCE模型提供了一种有效预测线性自伴随PDE支配的复合材料性能的方法，兼顾成本效益与可解释性。

Abstract: Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble
average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure
distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving
PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that
directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher
running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide
material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead
is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a
focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,
Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we
propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.
Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,
which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to
its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes
and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast
Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels
from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave
propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful
sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE
kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE
solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements
that are more accessible in material development contexts.

Abstract: Map-to-map matching is a critical task for aligning spatial data across
heterogeneous sources, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground
truth correspondences, sparse node features, and scalability demands. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph-based framework that addresses these
challenges through three key innovations. First, our method is an unsupervised
learning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for
large-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.
Second, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial
layout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and
enables scale-invariant learning. Third, we design an mechanism to adaptively
balance feature and geometric similarity, as well as a geometric-consistent
loss function, ensuring robustness to noisy or incomplete coordinate data. At
the implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based
post-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which
enables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,
particularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios. Our framework provides a
scalable and practical solution for map alignment, offering a robust and
efficient alternative to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: GP在性能上优于基于NN的方法，但由于计算复杂度高，限制了其实用性。而DE作为一种简单的集成方法，在兼顾计算效率与不确定性量化性能方面具有较大的优势，显示出其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,
despite performing naive ensembling. In terms of computational cost, the GP is
significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step

TL;DR: Tri-Accel是一种统一优化框架，通过动态混合精度更新、稀疏二阶信号和内存弹性批量缩放等技术，加速深度神经网络的训练，降低内存占用和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化深度神经网络面临GPU内存和计算时间瓶颈，现有加速技术孤立使用限制了效率的全面提升。

Method: 提出Tri-Accel框架，通过联合以下三种策略实现加速：（1）动态混合精度更新；（2）利用Hessian/Fisher稀疏性优化精度和步长；（3）实时调整批量大小适配内存变化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，Tri-Accel相比FP32基线训练时间减少9.9%，内存使用降低13.3%，且准确率提升1.1%；在CIFAR-100上动态适应学习资源分配，显著优化效率。

Conclusion: Tri-Accel结合算法适应性与硬件意识，在资源受限环境下显著提升神经网络的训练效率，适合在边缘设备和云端部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of
optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and
batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a
unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies
along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates
that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and
gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher
sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3)
Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to
VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel
achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage,
while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested
on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with
efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns
to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision
training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint
from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with
custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic
optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for
deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates
how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve
scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient
neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Abstract: The growing adoption of home banking systems has heightened the risk of
cyberfraud, necessitating fraud detection mechanisms that are not only accurate
but also fair and explainable. While AI models have shown promise in this
domain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the
interpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the
complexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement
learning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with
Population Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer
for Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs
population coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to
dynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under
fairness and recall constraints. Embedded within the Modular Supervisory
Framework for Spiking Network Training and Interpretation (MoSSTI), the system
incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically, saliency-based
attribution and spike activity profiling, to increase transparency. Evaluated
on the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset suite, our model achieves a $90.8\%$
recall at a strict $5\%$ false positive rate (FPR), outperforming
state-of-the-art spiking and non-spiking models while maintaining over $98\%$
predictive equality across key demographic attributes. The explainability
module further confirms that saliency attributions align with spiking dynamics,
validating interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining population-coded SNNs with reinforcement-guided hyper-heuristics for
fair, transparent, and high-performance fraud detection in real-world financial
applications.

Motivation: 研究transformer的注意力机制中的隐藏几何结构，以及其对于稀疏字典学习中特征死亡问题的影响。

Method: 分析transformer的注意力输出的几何特性，并提出了一种在低维子空间内进行初始化和训练的稀疏自动编码器方法。

Result: 将死特征比例从87%减少到不到1%，验证了子空间约束的有效性并扩展了稀疏字典学习的潜能。

Conclusion: 注意力输出存在低维几何约束，这一发现不仅揭示了transformer的本质特性，也为稀疏字典学习提供了新的改进方法。

Abstract: While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional
hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly
low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\%
of the variance--a phenomenon that is induced by the attention output
projection matrix and consistently observed across diverse model families and
datasets. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a fundamental cause of
the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it
creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic
geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a
subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs),
initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our
approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs
with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning
methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention
and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language
models.

Conclusion: DUFL成功协调了数据陈旧性与数据量，提升了模型性能，为时间敏感型任务中的联邦学习提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Handling data staleness remains a significant challenge in federated learning
with highly time-sensitive tasks, where data is generated continuously and data
staleness largely affects model performance. Although recent works attempt to
optimize data staleness by determining local data update frequency or client
selection strategy, none of them explore taking both data staleness and data
volume into consideration. In this paper, we propose DUFL(Data Updating in
Federated Learning), an incentive mechanism featuring an innovative local data
update scheme manipulated by three knobs: the server's payment, outdated data
conservation rate, and clients' fresh data collection volume, to coordinate
staleness and volume of local data for best utilities. To this end, we
introduce a novel metric called DoS(the Degree of Staleness) to quantify data
staleness and conduct a theoretic analysis illustrating the quantitative
relationship between DoS and model performance. We model DUFL as a two-stage
Stackelberg game with dynamic constraint, deriving the optimal local data
update strategy for each client in closed-form and the approximately optimal
strategy for the server. Experimental results on real-world datasets
demonstrate the significant performance of our approach.

Conclusion: 基于签名的近似方法在实现高效生成建模方面效果显著，Sig-DEG提供了一种计算高效而生成质量有保证的新途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in generative
modelling but remain computationally intensive at inference time, often
requiring thousands of discretization steps. To this end, we propose Sig-DEG
(Signature-based Differential Equation Generator), a novel generator for
distilling pre-trained diffusion models, which can universally approximate the
backward diffusion process at a coarse temporal resolution. Inspired by
high-order approximations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Sig-DEG
leverages partial signatures to efficiently summarize Brownian motion over
sub-intervals and adopts a recurrent structure to enable accurate global
approximation of the SDE solution. Distillation is formulated as a supervised
learning task, where Sig-DEG is trained to match the outputs of a
fine-resolution diffusion model on a coarse time grid. During inference,
Sig-DEG enables fast generation, as the partial signature terms can be
simulated exactly without requiring fine-grained Brownian paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Sig-DEG achieves competitive generation quality while reducing
the number of inference steps by an order of magnitude. Our results highlight
the effectiveness of signature-based approximations for efficient generative
modeling.

Motivation: 解决LLM存在的改进受限于探索样本质量和探索能力不足的矛盾问题，提升其推理和学习性能。

Method: 提出Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning(RuscaRL)框架。通过提供渐进性衰减的外部任务指南（检查表式评价表）推动模型高质量探索，同时利用评价表产生的可验证奖励进行有效训练，增强模型推理能力。

Result: RuscaRL在多个基准测试中表现出色，显著提升LLM推理性能，比如HealthBench-500测试中Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct从23.6提升到50.3，Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct达到61.1，超越GPT-4.1及其它领先LLM。

Conclusion: RuscaRL通过创新的指导与奖励机制，有效突破了LLM推理的探索瓶颈，并实现显著性能提升，为提升通用LLM推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of
reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma
persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet
the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of
LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be
explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded
Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework
designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.
Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit
scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics
are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse
high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,
encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)
verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain
robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL
on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding
reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL
significantly boosts Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,
surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading
LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解神经网络的多义性神经元，这些神经元对多个不相关特征有反应，增加了解释的复杂性，因此需要一种指标来量化和研究。

Method: 提出一个称为PSI（Polysemanticity Index）的指标，包括几何聚类质量、与标注类别的对齐性和通过CLIP实现的语义区分度。通过各种验证、横向分析及因果干预对PSI进行分析。

Result: 在ResNet-50实验中，PSI能够识别出语义上分明的神经元，揭示出深层中的PSI值更高。通过多种验证及干预实验证实了PSI的有效性。

Conclusion: PSI为发掘、量化和研究神经网络中多义性单元提供了一种合理且实用的手段。

Abstract: Neural networks often contain polysemantic neurons that respond to multiple,
sometimes unrelated, features, complicating mechanistic interpretability. We
introduce the Polysemanticity Index (PSI), a null-calibrated metric that
quantifies when a neuron's top activations decompose into semantically distinct
clusters. PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric
cluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary
semantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with
Tiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into
coherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers
exhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach
with robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and
cross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.
open-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,
aligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more
than non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls. PSI
thus offers a principled and practical lever for discovering, quantifying, and
studying polysemantic units in neural networks.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了反思机制的研究潜力和应用前景，既可用于增强反思防御，也揭示了在某些攻击场景中对反思进行抑制的风险。

Abstract: Reflection, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and
revise their own reasoning, has been widely used to improve performance on
complex reasoning tasks. Yet, most prior work emphasizes designing reflective
prompting strategies or reinforcement learning objectives, leaving the inner
mechanisms of reflection underexplored. In this paper, we investigate
reflection through the lens of latent directions in model activations. We
propose a methodology based on activation steering to characterize how
instructions with different reflective intentions: no reflection, intrinsic
reflection, and triggered reflection. By constructing steering vectors between
these reflection levels, we demonstrate that (1) new reflection-inducing
instructions can be systematically identified, (2) reflective behavior can be
directly enhanced or suppressed through activation interventions, and (3)
suppressing reflection is considerably easier than stimulating it. Experiments
on GSM8k-adv with Qwen2.5-3B and Gemma3-4B reveal clear stratification across
reflection levels, and steering interventions confirm the controllability of
reflection. Our findings highlight both opportunities (e.g.,
reflection-enhancing defenses) and risks (e.g., adversarial inhibition of
reflection in jailbreak attacks). This work opens a path toward mechanistic
understanding of reflective reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决在线学习中如何在对抗性环境下有效管理长期预算约束的问题。

Method: 设计了一种一阶在线算法，在全信息和带反馈设置下，最小化累计成本并控制资源消耗。

Result: 算法在α-近似凸的背景下实现了O(√T) α-后悔，并确保资源消耗不会超过O(B_T log T)+ ˜O(√T)。

Conclusion: 论文结果不仅证明了算法的有效性和紧致性，还扩展了这一框架适用的问题范围。

Abstract: We study an online learning problem with long-term budget constraints in the
adversarial setting. In this problem, at each round $t$, the learner selects an
action from a convex decision set, after which the adversary reveals a cost
function $f_t$ and a resource consumption function $g_t$. The cost and
consumption functions are assumed to be $\alpha$-approximately convex - a broad
class that generalizes convexity and encompasses many common non-convex
optimization problems, including DR-submodular maximization, Online Vertex
Cover, and Regularized Phase Retrieval. The goal is to design an online
algorithm that minimizes cumulative cost over a horizon of length $T$ while
approximately satisfying a long-term budget constraint of $B_T$. We propose an
efficient first-order online algorithm that guarantees $O(\sqrt{T})$
$\alpha$-regret against the optimal fixed feasible benchmark while consuming at
most $O(B_T \log T)+ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ resources in both full-information
and bandit feedback settings. In the bandit feedback setting, our approach
yields an efficient solution for the $\texttt{Adversarial Bandits with
Knapsacks}$ problem with improved guarantees. We also prove matching lower
bounds, demonstrating the tightness of our results. Finally, we characterize
the class of $\alpha$-approximately convex functions and show that our results
apply to a broad family of problems.

Motivation: 当前长上下文LLM推理面临KV缓存线性增长的问题，需要减少推理时的内存使用以提高效率。

Method: 通过线下训练CARTRIDGE以显著压缩KV缓存，分析其键值结构特性并提出一种新的初始化方法SCI以优化训练收敛速度。

Result: 证明了CARTRIDGE键值向量在不同任务和模型上的共享性与压缩特性，SCI加速了收敛。

Conclusion: 为优化CARTRIDGE的训练以及扩展长上下文LLM内存管理奠定了基础，涵盖任务泛化与内存效率提升的实证研究。

Abstract: A bottleneck for long-context LLM inference is the linearly growing KV cache.
Recent work has proposed CARTRIDGES, an approach which leverages offline
compute to train a much smaller KV cache than is typically required for a full
document (up to 40x less memory usage at inference time). In this paper, we
present the first mechanistic exploration of the learned CARTRIDGE key-value
cache structure. In particular, we propose that (1) CARTRIDGE keys act as
stable, shareable retrieval routers for the compressed corpora and (2) most of
the learned compression occurs within the CARTRIDGE value vectors. We present
empirical evidence of our routing theory across tasks, model families, and
model sizes; for example, we can ablate the learned CARTRIDGE key vectors
between tasks with little performance loss. Finally, we propose a slight
improvement in initialization called Sampled Chunk Initialization (SCI). We
suggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously
demonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader
empirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for
further scaling.

TL;DR: TabResFlow 是一种新的为单变量表格回归任务设计的标准化流模型，能更有效地处理灵活和复杂的分布，并展现出性能上的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的回归方法大多只着眼于点估计，未充分考虑预测不确定性，对实际复杂分布的适应性较差。而工业场景中对预测的质量和可信性有极高要求。

Method: 提出了TabResFlow模型，包含（1）对每个数值特征编码的MLP，（2）全连接ResNet作为特征提取主干网络，以及（3）用于灵活密度估计的条件样条正则化流。

Result: 在9个公开数据集上测试，TabResFlow比现有的概率回归模型的似然分数表现更优，超过TreeFlow 9.64%，推理速度比NodeFlow快约5.6倍。在二手车价格预测任务中，提出的新指标AURC上也表现更优。

Conclusion: TabResFlow 提高了回归预测的鲁棒性和效率，为工业及应用场景提供了一种新的高性能选择，同时在指标和实际实验中被验证成果显著。

Abstract: Tabular regression is a well-studied problem with numerous industrial
applications, yet most existing approaches focus on point estimation, often
leading to overconfident predictions. This issue is particularly critical in
industrial automation, where trustworthy decision-making is essential.
Probabilistic regression models address this challenge by modeling prediction
uncertainty. However, many conventional methods assume a fixed-shape
distribution (typically Gaussian), and resort to estimating distribution
parameters. This assumption is often restrictive, as real-world target
distributions can be highly complex. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
TabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for
univariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like
RealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow
consists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical
feature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature
extraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and
tractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark
datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic
regression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%
improvement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model
(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the
strongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the
practical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction
task under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we
introduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that
TabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.

Motivation: 现有的基于二叉搜索树的哈希方法存在高增长性和稀疏性的问题，同时需要提升数据分析效率及癌症基因组学的应用能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为ComBI的高速近邻搜索算法与基于决策树和增强技术的GRAF新分类器，并结合深度学习框架CRCS来处理基因变异解释性问题。

Conclusion: 这些算法为大规模数据分析及生物医学开发提供了高效、可扩展且易解释的工具，为癌症基因组学研究和应用带来了新的可能性。

Abstract: This thesis develops computational methods in similarity-preserving hashing,
classification, and cancer genomics. Standard space partitioning-based hashing
relies on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), but their exponential growth and sparsity
hinder efficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Compressed BST of Inverted
hash tables (ComBI), which enables fast approximate nearest-neighbor search
with reduced memory. On datasets of up to one billion samples, ComBI achieves
0.90 precision with 4X-296X speed-ups over Multi-Index Hashing, and also
outperforms Cellfishing.jl on single-cell RNA-seq searches with 2X-13X gains.
Building on hashing structures, we propose Guided Random Forest (GRAF), a
tree-based ensemble classifier that integrates global and local partitioning,
bridging decision trees and boosting while reducing generalization error.
Across 115 datasets, GRAF delivers competitive or superior accuracy, and its
unsupervised variant (uGRAF) supports guided hashing and importance sampling.
We show that GRAF and ComBI can be used to estimate per-sample classifiability,
which enables scalable prediction of cancer patient survival. To address
challenges in interpreting mutations, we introduce Continuous Representation of
Codon Switches (CRCS), a deep learning framework that embeds genetic changes
into numerical vectors. CRCS allows identification of somatic mutations without
matched normals, discovery of driver genes, and scoring of tumor mutations,
with survival prediction validated in bladder, liver, and brain cancers.
Together, these methods provide efficient, scalable, and interpretable tools
for large-scale data analysis and biomedical applications.

operational efficiency by more effectively capturing intricate patterns in

Motivation: 现有的GNN在预测上的不确定性度量不足且缺乏解释性，限制了其在关键领域的应用。

Method: 该方法假设一组潜在的解释（rationales），并将其映射到概率嵌入空间，通过学习随机相关矩阵将分类器的预测分布与此嵌入相关联，并通过图生成器从嵌入空间解码图结构来实现模型的解释性，同时采用类似EM算法的交替优化方法提高训练效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法是一种通用模型，可应用于任何现存的GNN架构，而解码出的解释性结构能够提供有意义的解释。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools on graph data. However, their
predictions are mis-calibrated and lack interpretability, limiting their
adoption in critical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware and interpretable graph classification model that combines
graph functional neural process and graph generative model. The core of our
method is to assume a set of latent rationales which can be mapped to a
probabilistic embedding space; the predictive distribution of the classifier is
conditioned on such rationale embeddings by learning a stochastic correlation
matrix. The graph generator serves to decode the graph structure of the
rationales from the embedding space for model interpretability. For efficient
model training, we adopt an alternating optimization procedure which mimics the
well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed method is
general and can be applied to any existing GNN architecture. Extensive
experiments on five graph classification datasets demonstrate that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both uncertainty
quantification and GNN interpretability. We also conduct case studies to show
that the decoded rationale structure can provide meaningful explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新算法RoSDHB，结合了Polyak动量与新的协调压缩机制，在通信成本较低的情况下实现了对分布式学习中的拜占庭容忍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习在拜占庭故障和高通信成本的情况下面临挑战，而现有方法对这两个问题的结合研究有限。

Method: 提出新算法RoSDHB，结合Polyak动量与协调压缩机制，同时仅假设诚实节点平均损失函数的Lipschitz光滑性，相较于现有方法要求假设更少。

Result: 在标准异质性模型下，RoSDHB表现与现有Byz-DASHA-PAGE算法相当，但假设条件更宽松，且在图像分类任务中表现出显著的鲁棒性和通信效率提升。

Conclusion: RoSDHB在分布式学习框架下提供了高效通信与鲁棒性兼具的解决方案。

Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) enables scalable model training over decentralized
data, but remains challenged by Byzantine faults and high communication costs.
While both issues have been studied extensively in isolation, their interaction
is less explored. Prior work shows that naively combining communication
compression with Byzantine-robust aggregation degrades resilience to faulty
nodes (or workers). The state-of-the-art algorithm, namely Byz-DASHA-PAGE [29],
makes use of the momentum variance reduction scheme to mitigate the detrimental
impact of compression noise on Byzantine-robustness. We propose a new
algorithm, named RoSDHB, that integrates the classic Polyak's momentum with a
new coordinated compression mechanism. We show that RoSDHB performs comparably
to Byz-DASHA-PAGE under the standard (G, B)-gradient dissimilarity
heterogeneity model, while it relies on fewer assumptions. In particular, we
only assume Lipschitz smoothness of the average loss function of the honest
workers, in contrast to [29]that additionally assumes a special smoothness of
bounded global Hessian variance. Empirical results on benchmark image
classification task show that RoSDHB achieves strong robustness with
significant communication savings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨大规模专家混合（MoE）模型在内存受限的边缘设备上的部署，其中提出了MoE-Beyond以提升内存管理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大规模MoE模型在边缘设备上的应用受到内存限制，其传统启发式专家缓存策略在模型参数扩展时表现不佳，亟需新的方法提高缓存命中率。

Method: 提出了一种轻量化的学习型专家激活预测器MoE-Beyond，将任务表述为多标签序列预测问题，并通过轻量级Transformer模型训练66百万个专家激活记录。

Result: 实验表明，MoE-Beyond在未见过的WebGLM-QA数据集上的预测准确率达到97.5%，F1得分达到86.6%，并将GPU缓存命中率从17%提高到72%。

Conclusion: MoE-Beyond显著提升了模型的缓存效率，在资源有限场景下为MoE模型部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices
presents significant challenges due to memory constraints. While MoE
architectures enable efficient utilization of computational resources by
activating only a subset of experts per inference, they require careful memory
management to operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity
struggle to maintain high cache hit rates as models parameters scale. In this
work, we introduce MoE-Beyond, a learning-based expert activation predictor
trained to predict expert activations during autoregressive decoding. By
framing the task as a multi-label sequence prediction problem, we train a
lightweight transformer model on 66 million expert activation traces extracted
from LDJnr-Puffin dataset [5] using DeepSeek-V2-Chat-Lite MoE. Our predictor
generalizes effectively across unseen prompts from WebGLM-QA dataset [6],
achieving 97.5% accuracy and an 86.6% F1-score. Simulation results show that
MoE-Beyond improves GPU cache hit rate from 17% to 72% when only 10% of experts
fit in GPU cache, outperforming heuristic baselines.

Motivation: 探讨在有限和优化中战略查询是否能优于均匀查询策略，以提升优化效率。

Method: 首先提出依赖于梯度的Oracle Gradient Querying（OGQ）算法，随后为实际应用限制设计出一种仅需单次查询的Strategic Gradient Querying（SGQ）算法。

Result: OGQ算法在瞬态性能和稳态方差上有所提升，而SGQ算法虽不能匹敌OGQ，但瞬态性能优于传统SGD。

Conclusion: 利用战略查询有潜力超越传统均匀查询策略，同时SGQ算法是一种实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper considers a finite-sum optimization problem under first-order
queries and investigates the benefits of strategic querying on stochastic
gradient-based methods compared to uniform querying strategy. We first
introduce Oracle Gradient Querying (OGQ), an idealized algorithm that selects
one user's gradient yielding the largest possible expected improvement (EI) at
each step. However, OGQ assumes oracle access to the gradients of all users to
make such a selection, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. To address
this limitation, we propose Strategic Gradient Querying (SGQ), a practical
algorithm that has better transient-state performance than SGD while making
only one query per iteration. For smooth objective functions satisfying the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, we show that under the assumption of EI
heterogeneity, OGQ enhances transient-state performance and reduces
steady-state variance, while SGQ improves transient-state performance over SGD.
Our numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Clustering algorithms are widely used in various applications, with
density-based methods such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) being particularly prominent. These algorithms identify
clusters in high-density regions while treating sparser areas as noise.
However, reliance on user-defined parameters often poses optimization
challenges that require domain expertise. This paper presents a novel
density-based clustering method inspired by the concept of selective attention,
which minimizes the need for user-defined parameters under standard conditions.
Initially, the algorithm operates without requiring user-defined parameters. If
parameter adjustment is needed, the method simplifies the process by
introducing a single integer parameter that is straightforward to tune. The
approach computes a threshold to filter out the most sparsely distributed
points and outliers, forms a preliminary cluster structure, and then
reintegrates the excluded points to finalize the results. Experimental
evaluations on diverse data sets highlight the accessibility and robust
performance of the method, providing an effective alternative for density-based
clustering tasks.

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning APIs enable widespread model customization,
yet pose significant safety risks. Recent work shows that adversaries can
exploit access to these APIs to bypass model safety mechanisms by encoding
harmful content in seemingly harmless fine-tuning data, evading both human
monitoring and standard content filters. We formalize the fine-tuning API
defense problem, and introduce the Cipher Fine-tuning Robustness benchmark
(CIFR), a benchmark for evaluating defense strategies' ability to retain model
safety in the face of cipher-enabled attackers while achieving the desired
level of fine-tuning functionality. We include diverse cipher encodings and
families, with some kept exclusively in the test set to evaluate for
generalization across unseen ciphers and cipher families. We then evaluate
different defenses on the benchmark and train probe monitors on model internal
activations from multiple fine-tunes. We show that probe monitors achieve over
99% detection accuracy, generalize to unseen cipher variants and families, and
compare favorably to state-of-the-art monitoring approaches. We open-source
CIFR and the code to reproduce our experiments to facilitate further research
in this critical area. Code and data are available online

Conclusion: ONG算法有效结合了正交梯度下降和自然梯度方法，为连续学习任务提供了新的解决方案，并提高了任务间性能保持能力。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient descent has emerged as a powerful method for continual
learning tasks. However, its Euclidean projections overlook the underlying
information-geometric structure of the space of distributions parametrized by
neural networks, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To
counteract this, we combine it with the idea of the natural gradient and
present ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent). ONG preconditions each new
task gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher
information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction
under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks,
ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior
task gradients. We provide a theoretical justification for this procedure,
introduce the ONG algorithm, and benchmark its performance on the Permuted and
Rotated MNIST datasets. All code for our experiments/reproducibility can be
found at https://github.com/yajatyadav/orthogonal-natural-gradient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普遍的OOD检测算法难以区分对抗性ID样本与OOD样本，而对抗性训练会导致锐利的损失函数曲面，阻碍模型融合。因此，需要一种新的方法来提升对抗性环境中的OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出了SaGD框架，通过在嵌入几何上平滑对抗性训练引起的锐利损失曲面，提升几何嵌入收敛性，并结合基于扰动的对抗性训练，增强对未知攻击的防御能力。

Result: SaGD显著提升了在区分CIFAR-100与其他六个OOD数据集上的FPR和AUC，并揭示了尖锐损失曲面与对抗性OOD检测之间的关系。

Conclusion: SaGD框架显著提高了对抗性环境中的OOD检测性能，为处理此类问题提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection ensures safe and reliable model
deployment. Contemporary OOD algorithms using geometry projection can detect
OOD or adversarial samples from clean in-distribution (ID) samples. However,
this setting regards adversarial ID samples as OOD, leading to incorrect OOD
predictions. Existing efforts on OOD detection with ID and OOD data under
attacks are minimal. In this paper, we develop a robust OOD detection method
that distinguishes adversarial ID samples from OOD ones. The sharp loss
landscape created by adversarial training hinders model convergence, impacting
the latent embedding quality for OOD score calculation. Therefore, we introduce
a {\bf Sharpness-aware Geometric Defense (SaGD)} framework to smooth out the
rugged adversarial loss landscape in the projected latent geometry. Enhanced
geometric embedding convergence enables accurate ID data characterization,
benefiting OOD detection against adversarial attacks. We use Jitter-based
perturbation in adversarial training to extend the defense ability against
unseen attacks. Our SaGD framework significantly improves FPR and AUC over the
state-of-the-art defense approaches in differentiating CIFAR-100 from six other
OOD datasets under various attacks. We further examine the effects of
perturbations at various adversarial training levels, revealing the
relationship between the sharp loss landscape and adversarial OOD detection.

Abstract: Graphs have become a central representation in machine learning for capturing
relational and structured data across various domains. Traditional graph neural
networks often struggle to capture long-range dependencies between nodes due to
their local structure. Graph transformers overcome this by using attention
mechanisms that allow nodes to exchange information globally. However, there
are two types of attention in graph transformers: dense and sparse. In this
paper, we compare these two attention mechanisms, analyze their trade-offs, and
highlight when to use each. We also outline current challenges and problems in

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型自信行为的多组件结构，为缓解过度自信问题提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting
information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate
the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using
open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness
datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute
similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis
identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that
high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of
emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration
Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these
sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly
influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized
effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component
structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating
overconfident behavior.

TL;DR: BudgetThinker提出了一种新框架，通过预算感知的推理策略实现对LLMs推理长度的精准控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs尽管推理能力强，但在实时性或成本敏感的应用中因为高资源消耗而受限。因此，开发一种能够在预算约束内高效运行的机制非常必要。

Method: 提出一种通过在推理过程中插入特定控制标记的方式，结合监督微调和基于课程的强化学习两阶段训练策略，优化模型在准确性和预算限制上的表现。

Result: BudgetThinker在多个推理预算下表现优于强基线模型，尤其是在处理复杂数学任务时。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高效且可控的LLM推理机制提供了一种可扩展且有效的解决方案，使其在资源受限或实时场景下的应用更具实用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased
test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while
effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their
applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This
paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with
budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their
thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special
control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its
remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage
training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize
the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement
Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize
for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker
significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a
variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method
provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and
controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for
deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究医疗领域中基于RAG的多模态系统的漏洞，并提出一种名为MedThreatRAG的框架，通过注入多模态对抗数据来揭示这些系统的安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索医疗RAG系统中可能存在的安全漏洞，并研究如何通过跨模态数据注入来影响系统性能。

Method: 设计了一种模拟半开放攻击环境的方法，注入具有语义矛盾的图文对（CMCI），研究其对系统检索与生成能力的影响。此外，还进行了基本的文本与视觉攻击实验。

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR任务上，系统回答的F1得分减少了最多27.66%，如LLaVA-Med-1.5的F1得分下降至最低51.36%。显示该方式可以严重影响系统性能。

Conclusion: 突出了临床RAG系统的安全缺陷，提出需要威胁感知设计和多模态一致性检查，并提供了未来系统开发的安全设计指引。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) augmented with Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) are increasingly employed in medical AI to enhance factual
grounding through external clinical image-text retrieval. However, this
reliance creates a significant attack surface. We propose MedThreatRAG, a novel
multimodal poisoning framework that systematically probes vulnerabilities in
medical RAG systems by injecting adversarial image-text pairs. A key innovation
of our approach is the construction of a simulated semi-open attack
environment, mimicking real-world medical systems that permit periodic
knowledge base updates via user or pipeline contributions. Within this setting,
we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal
alignment while remaining sufficiently plausible to evade conventional filters.
While basic textual and visual attacks are included for completeness, CMCI
demonstrates the most severe degradation. Evaluations on IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
QA tasks show that MedThreatRAG reduces answer F1 scores by up to 27.66% and
lowers LLaVA-Med-1.5 F1 rates to as low as 51.36%. Our findings expose
fundamental security gaps in clinical RAG systems and highlight the urgent need
for threat-aware design and robust multimodal consistency checks. Finally, we
conclude with a concise set of guidelines to inform the safe development of
future multimodal medical RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着城市车辆增加，现有道路基础设施难以满足现代交通需求，出现拥堵问题，需要高效路径规划策略。然而，现有模型多集中于确定性或时间依赖网络，忽略了交通流量中的相关性和随机性。为解决此问题，作者提出改进方案。

Method: 通过整合决策Transformer和广义策略梯度（GPG）框架，利用决策Transformer捕获长期依赖关系，从而提升路径决策的准确性与稳定性。

Result: 实验在Sioux Falls Network（SFN）中验证了方法的有效性，结果表明该方案在按时到达概率与路径规划精度上优于先前基线模型。

Conclusion: 方法有效提高了随机交通网络中路径规划的准确性与稳定性，并在关键指标上显著优于其他方法。

Abstract: With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road
infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in
the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path
planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on
deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations
and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the
reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under
certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the
decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework.
Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies,
our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions.
Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival
probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的方法，通过平滑损失函数的景观，提升双曲神经网络（HNNs）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲神经网络在处理层次结构数据方面表现出色，但其性能受曲率优化的显著影响。目前缺乏关于曲率如何影响HNNs的泛化能力的理论分析。

Method: 本文推导了HNNs的PAC-Bayesian泛化界，提出了一种锋利度感知的曲率学习方法，通过双层优化和隐式求导算法，优化曲率以提升泛化能力。

Result: 理论分析证明了所提出方法的逼近误差有上界，且能收敛。在分类、长尾数据学习、噪声数据学习和小样本学习实验中，该方法均显著提升了HNNs的性能。

Conclusion: 通过优化曲率平滑损失景观的方式，可以有效增强HNNs的泛化能力，此方法已在多种场景下展示出其有效性。

Abstract: Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) have demonstrated notable efficacy in
representing real-world data with hierarchical structures via exploiting the
geometric properties of hyperbolic spaces characterized by negative curvatures.
Curvature plays a crucial role in optimizing HNNs. Inappropriate curvatures may
cause HNNs to converge to suboptimal parameters, degrading overall performance.
So far, the theoretical foundation of the effect of curvatures on HNNs has not
been developed. In this paper, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound of
HNNs, highlighting the role of curvatures in the generalization of HNNs via
their effect on the smoothness of the loss landscape. Driven by the derived
bound, we propose a sharpness-aware curvature learning method to smooth the
loss landscape, thereby improving the generalization of HNNs. In our method,
  we design a scope sharpness measure for curvatures, which is minimized
through a bi-level optimization process. Then, we introduce an implicit
differentiation algorithm that efficiently solves the bi-level optimization by
approximating gradients of curvatures. We present the approximation error and
convergence analyses of the proposed method, showing that the approximation
error is upper-bounded, and the proposed method can converge by bounding
gradients of HNNs. Experiments on four settings: classification, learning from
long-tailed data, learning from noisy data, and few-shot learning show that our
method can improve the performance of HNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效遗忘方法对Transformer模型中的模块缺乏针对性，导致参数定位不准确，从而影响遗忘性能。

Method: 提出了一种使用可学习掩码对Transformer的头部和过滤器中的重要参数进行标记的方法，这些掩码通过基于遗忘需求的优化目标进行学习，并通过结合温启动的贪婪搜索算法实现优化。

Conclusion: MAPE-Unlearn在有效定位和删除影响关键数据方面提供了一个新的解决方案，有助于满足隐私保护的需求并提高Transformer的模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer has become fundamental to a vast series of pre-trained large
models that have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications.
Machine unlearning, which focuses on efficiently removing specific data
influences to comply with privacy regulations, shows promise in restricting
updates to influence-critical parameters. However, existing parameter-efficient
unlearning methods are largely devised in a module-oblivious manner, which
tends to inaccurately identify these parameters and leads to inferior
unlearning performance for Transformers. In this paper, we propose {\tt
MAPE-Unlearn}, a module-aware parameter-efficient machine unlearning approach
that uses a learnable pair of masks to pinpoint influence-critical parameters
in the heads and filters of Transformers. The learning objective of these masks
is derived by desiderata of unlearning and optimized through an efficient
algorithm featured by a greedy search with a warm start. Extensive experiments
on various Transformer models and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of {\tt MAPE-Unlearn} for unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释过参数化深度学习模型在实际中表现出良好泛化性的原因，特别是像Transformer模型这样的注意力模型。

Method: 提出基于注意力矩阵有效秩的容量度量，并用于推导与经验标度一致的泛化界限。

Result: 得到的泛化界限依赖于样本大小，与大语言模型观察到的经验标度一致（有对数因子）。

Conclusion: 注意力的谱特性，而非参数数量，可能是理解这些模型泛化性的关键。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often contain far more parameters than training
examples, yet they still manage to generalize well in practice. Classical
complexity measures such as VC-dimension or PAC-Bayes bounds usually become
vacuous in this overparameterized regime, offering little explanation for the
empirical success of models like Transformers. In this work, I explore an
alternative notion of capacity for attention-based models, based on the
effective rank of their attention matrices. The intuition is that, although the
parameter count is enormous, the functional dimensionality of attention is
often much lower. I show that this quantity leads to a generalization bound
whose dependence on sample size matches empirical scaling laws observed in
large language models, up to logarithmic factors. While the analysis is not a
complete theory of overparameterized learning, it provides evidence that
spectral properties of attention, rather than raw parameter counts, may be the
right lens for understanding why these models generalize.

Abstract: . Predicting and calculating the aerodynamic coefficients of airfoils near
the ground with CFD software requires much time. However, the availability of
data from CFD simulation results and the development of new neural network
methods have made it possible to present the simulation results using methods
like VGG, a CCN neural network method. In this article, lift-to-drag
coefficients of airfoils near the ground surface are predicted with the help of
a neural network. This prediction can only be realized by providing data for
training and learning the code that contains information on the lift-to-drag
ratio of the primary data and images related to the airfoil cross-section,
which are converted into a matrix. One advantage of the VGG method over other
methods is that its results are more accurate than those of other CNN methods.

Result: 模型在MIT-BIH数据集上的验证准确率为98.3%，但在整合数据集上表现有所下降。同时，渐变法和DeepLIFT更符合临床解释需求。

Conclusion: 强调了领域特定的XAI调整的重要性，基于显著性图的解释更符合医学直觉。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have enabled highly accurate arrhythmia
detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, but limited interpretability
remains a barrier to clinical adoption. This study investigates the application
of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically adapted for time-series ECG
analysis. Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, a convolutional neural
network-based model was developed for arrhythmia classification, with
R-peak-based segmentation via the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To increase the
dataset size and to reduce class imbalance, an additional 12-lead ECG dataset
was incorporated. A user needs assessment was carried out to identify what kind
of explanation would be preferred by medical professionals. Medical
professionals indicated a preference for saliency map-based explanations over
counterfactual visualisations, citing clearer correspondence with ECG
interpretation workflows. Four SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based
approaches: permutation importance, KernelSHAP, gradient-based methods, and
Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT), were implemented and compared. The
model achieved 98.3% validation accuracy on MIT-BIH but showed performance
degradation on the combined dataset, underscoring dataset variability
challenges. Permutation importance and KernelSHAP produced cluttered visual
outputs, while gradient-based and DeepLIFT methods highlighted waveform regions
consistent with clinical reasoning, but with variability across samples.
Findings emphasize the need for domain-specific XAI adaptations in ECG analysis
and highlight saliency mapping as a more clinically intuitive approach

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络（PINN）的框架，用于预测核反应堆中辐照的不锈钢及铁素体/马氏体钢的低周疲劳（LCF）寿命，并显著优于传统机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经验模型难以准确捕捉核反应堆材料中高温辐照和循环载荷引起的复杂退化行为，亟需更精确的预测方法。

Method: 通过将实际疲劳寿命的物理约束融入到PINN模型的损失函数中进行训练，并使用包括495个辐照和未辐照数据点的数据集进行验证。

Result: PINN在预测精度和泛化能力上优于随机森林、梯度提升、极端梯度提升及传统神经网络等模型，同时通过SHAP分析验证了重要特征如应变幅值、辐照剂量和测试温度与疲劳寿命的物理一致性。

Conclusion: PINN框架提供了一种可靠且可解释的方法来预测辐照合金的疲劳寿命，可用于辅助合金选择和工程决策。

Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to
predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and
ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials
experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing
complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture
accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life
constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and
generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and
unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning
models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and
the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis
identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as
dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with
physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at
higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a
reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated
alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种动态调整稀疏性的新框架，称为Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders (AdaptiveK)，以适应输入的语义复杂性，并在多项指标上优于固定稀疏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在解释大语言模型(LLMs)的内在表示时，目前的方法固定了稀疏性限制，未考虑输入的复杂性，需要一种更适应性的稀疏自动编码器框架。

Method: 提出一种名为Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders (AdaptiveK)的新框架，该框架基于输入语义复杂性动态调整稀疏性，利用线性探测来编码语义复杂性信号，并引导特征分配训练。

Result: 通过对三个不同大小语言模型的实验显示，AdaptiveK在重建保真度、解释方差和余弦相似度方面显著优于固定稀疏方法，同时还减少了超参数调节的计算负担。

Conclusion: AdaptiveK有效地提高了稀疏自动编码器的表现，证明了基于语义复杂性的动态调整可以更好地优化模型性能，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs)
remains a central challenge for interpretability research. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) offer a promising solution by decomposing activations into interpretable
features, but existing approaches rely on fixed sparsity constraints that fail
to account for input complexity. We propose Adaptive Top K Sparse Autoencoders
(AdaptiveK), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts sparsity levels based
on the semantic complexity of each input. Leveraging linear probes, we
demonstrate that context complexity is linearly encoded in LLM representations,
and we use this signal to guide feature allocation during training. Experiments
across three language models (Pythia-70M, Pythia-160M, and Gemma-2-2B)
demonstrate that this complexity-driven adaptation significantly outperforms
fixed-sparsity approaches on reconstruction fidelity, explained variance, and
cosine similarity metrics while eliminating the computational burden of
extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: 研究频率原则（FP）现象在非平坦域（如单位球面上的学习）的适用性及约束条件。

Method: 通过球面谐波展开分析固定和可训练神经元方向对学习频率的影响，并结合数值实验探讨权重方向更新对学习复杂性的影响。

Result: 发现即使存在FP的低频先导倾向，这一原则在特定初始化或误差分布条件下可能被打破；可训练权重方向增加了学习复杂性，但同时可能保持低频优势或更快出现高频特征。

Conclusion: 在曲面域上，FP应该被视为一种倾向而非规则，方向更新与谐波展开对频率相关的学习有重要影响。

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex
challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental
sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these

concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL)
framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for
Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement

maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results
highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally

Result: FPA攻击不仅有效，还具有跨模型和编程语言的迁移性；即使警告模型也难以防御。

Conclusion: FPA攻击揭示了基于LLM的代码工具的可靠性和安全性风险，并展示了这种攻击方式的潜在防御用途。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted to perform automated
code review and static analysis at scale, supporting tasks such as
vulnerability detection, summarization, and refactoring. In this paper, we
identify and exploit a critical vulnerability in LLM-based code analysis: an
abstraction bias that causes models to overgeneralize familiar programming
patterns and overlook small, meaningful bugs. Adversaries can exploit this
blind spot to hijack the control flow of the LLM's interpretation with minimal
edits and without affecting actual runtime behavior. We refer to this attack as
a Familiar Pattern Attack (FPA).
  We develop a fully automated, black-box algorithm that discovers and injects
FPAs into target code. Our evaluation shows that FPAs are not only effective,
but also transferable across models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0) and
universal across programming languages (Python, C, Rust, Go). Moreover, FPAs
remain effective even when models are explicitly warned about the attack via
robust system prompts. Finally, we explore positive, defensive uses of FPAs and
discuss their broader implications for the reliability and safety of
code-oriented LLMs.

Result: ShaLa在多个基准测试中表现出超过最先进多模态VAE的连贯性和合成质量，并能够扩展到更多的模态。

Conclusion: ShaLa有效解决了现有多模态VAE在表达能力和扩展性上的局限，为多模态合成和推断任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative framework for learning shared latent
representations across multimodal data. Many advanced multimodal methods focus
on capturing all combinations of modality-specific details across inputs, which
can inadvertently obscure the high-level semantic concepts that are shared
across modalities. Notably, Multimodal VAEs with low-dimensional latent
variables are designed to capture shared representations, enabling various
tasks such as joint multimodal synthesis and cross-modal inference. However,
multimodal VAEs often struggle to design expressive joint variational
posteriors and suffer from low-quality synthesis. In this work, ShaLa addresses
these challenges by integrating a novel architectural inference model and a
second-stage expressive diffusion prior, which not only facilitates effective
inference of shared latent representation but also significantly improves the
quality of downstream multimodal synthesis. We validate ShaLa extensively
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior coherence and synthesis
quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal VAEs. Furthermore, ShaLa scales
to many more modalities while prior multimodal VAEs have fallen short in
capturing the increasing complexity of the shared latent space.

*Omar Bekdache,Naresh Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FedERL，一种专为资源受限的联邦学习环境设计的方法，解决了客户设备上的计算资源限制和常见数据损坏问题，并显著减少了时间与能源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保护数据隐私的前提下，FL应用面临客户端计算资源限制和对噪声、模糊等数据损坏的鲁棒性较差的问题，而现有方法过于耗费资源，难以应用于资源受限设备。

Method: 开发了一种名为FedERL的方法，引入了DART（数据无关鲁棒训练）方法，在服务器端增强鲁棒性，而无需客户端访问训练数据，从而实现零鲁棒性开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，在有限时间和能量预算下，FedERL能更高效地应对数据损坏问题，其性能优于传统鲁棒训练方法。

Conclusion: FedERL是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够在现实世界的FL应用中实现高效鲁棒表现，同时在时间与能源消耗上大幅缩减。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) accelerates the deployment of deep learning models on
edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL systems face challenges
due to client-side constraints on computational resources, and from a lack of
robustness to common corruptions such as noise, blur, and weather effects.
Existing robust training methods are computationally expensive and unsuitable
for resource-constrained clients. We propose FedERL, federated efficient and
robust learning, as the first work to explicitly address corruption robustness
under time and energy constraints on the client side. At its core, FedERL
employs a novel data-agnostic robust training (DART) method on the server to
enhance robustness without access to the training data. In doing so, FedERL
ensures zero robustness overhead for clients. Extensive experiments demonstrate
FedERL's ability to handle common corruptions at a fraction of the time and
energy cost of traditional robust training methods. In scenarios with limited
time and energy budgets, FedERL surpasses the performance of traditional robust
training, establishing it as a practical and scalable solution for real-world
FL applications.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains
challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces,
while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent
advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via
explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a
GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link
prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by
LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these
tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs.
Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work
highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides
new resources for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种高效的多关系图聚类方法DEMM和DEMM+，以解决现有方法中效率低下和结果质量差的问题，通过优化多关系的Dirichlet能量实现了优质节点特征向量的生成，并采用创新的线性时间聚类方法，大幅提升了适用性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多关系图聚类方法在结合异构图的结构和属性时效果欠佳，同时在处理大规模图时成本过高，亟需一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段优化目标：DEMM通过优化多关系Dirichlet能量以生成高质量节点特征，DEMM+通过优化节点关联图的聚类结果能量并采用线性时间聚类方法，极大提升了效率。

Result: 实验表明，DEMM+在聚类质量上相比20种基线方法具有显著优势，同时在处理11种真实多关系图上表现出极高的速度和效率。

Conclusion: DEMM与DEMM+提供了一种创新且优质的多关系图聚类解决方案，特别是DEMM+展现了卓越的可扩展性和高效性，适用于大规模图数据分析。

Abstract: Multi-relational graphs (MRGs) are an expressive data structure for modeling
diverse interactions/relations among real objects (i.e., nodes), which pervade
extensive applications and scenarios. Given an MRG G with N nodes, partitioning
the node set therein into K disjoint clusters (MRGC) is a fundamental task in
analyzing MRGs, which has garnered considerable attention. However, the
majority of existing solutions towards MRGC either yield severely compromised
result quality by ineffective fusion of heterogeneous graph structures and
attributes, or struggle to cope with sizable MRGs with millions of nodes and
billions of edges due to the adoption of sophisticated and costly deep learning
models.
  In this paper, we present DEMM and DEMM+, two effective MRGC approaches to
address the limitations above. Specifically, our algorithms are built on novel
two-stage optimization objectives, where the former seeks to derive
high-caliber node feature vectors by optimizing the multi-relational Dirichlet
energy specialized for MRGs, while the latter minimizes the Dirichlet energy of
clustering results over the node affinity graph. In particular, DEMM+ achieves
significantly higher scalability and efficiency over our based method DEMM
through a suite of well-thought-out optimizations. Key technical contributions
include (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node
feature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with
carefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without
explicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend
DEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations. Extensive
experiments, comparing DEMM+ against 20 baselines over 11 real MRGs, exhibit
that DEMM+ is consistently superior in terms of clustering quality measured
against ground-truth labels, while often being remarkably faster.

Motivation: 探究LLM的规模、训练时长以及预训练FLOPs与检索性能的关联，为LLM-based检索器的开发提供指导。

Method: 实验使用125M到7B参数的模型，预训练数据集范围从10亿到超过2万亿tokens；评估零样本BEIR任务及上下文学习的相关性与检索性能的关系。

retrieval performance across LLM model sizes from 125 million parameters to 7
billion parameters pretrained on datasets ranging from 1 billion tokens to more

tasks predictably scales with LLM size, training duration, and estimated FLOPs.
We also show that In-Context Learning scores are strongly correlated with
retrieval scores across retrieval tasks. Finally, we highlight the implications
this has for the development of LLM-based retrievers.

### [442] [Mutual Information Surprise: Rethinking Unexpectedness in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17403)
*Yinsong Wang,Xiao Liu,Quan Zeng,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架——互信息惊讶（MIS），将惊讶从异常检测重新定义为认知增长的信号，用于改进自主系统的学习和适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的惊讶测量方式（如香农惊讶或贝叶斯惊讶）仅能瞬时检测偏差，无法反映系统是否在真实学习和适应，需要一种新的机制解决此问题。

Method: 通过量化新观测对互信息的影响，开发了统计测试序列以检测互信息的显著变化，并提出了“互信息惊讶反应策略”（MISRP），通过动态调整采样和分叉流程来改变系统行为。

Result: 经过在合成域和动态污染地图估算任务中的实证评估表明，MISRP相比传统惊讶方法具有更优异的稳定性、响应性和预测准确性。

Conclusion: 将惊讶从被动反应转变为反映认知增长的信号，MIS为更加自我感知和适应性的自主系统提供了可能的途径。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated
remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains
limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core
limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the
unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or
Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture
whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce
Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not
as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the
impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems
to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test
sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and
propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically
governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking.
Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map
estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform
classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and
predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS
offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.

### [443] [FRAME : Comprehensive Risk Assessment Framework for Adversarial Machine Learning Threats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17405)
*Avishag Shapira,Simon Shigol,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FRAME，一个面向机器学习(ML)系统的自动化和全面的对抗性机器学习(AML)风险评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前传统的风险评估无法有效评估AML威胁，而现有方法多局限于技术攻击的鲁棒性，缺乏对真实部署环境等实际因素的考量。

Method: FRAME提出新的评估方法，基于部署环境、AML技术特性和研究经验量化风险，同时引入可行性评分机制及基于LLM的评估定制，并开发AML攻击数据集支持情境化评估。

Result: 验证表明FRAME在六种应用场景中表现出高度准确性，与专家分析结果一致。

Conclusion: FRAME为组织提供了一种优先评估AML风险的工具，帮助在真实应用中安全部署AI系统。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) systems increased attention
to their security and emergence of adversarial machine learning (AML)
techniques that exploit fundamental vulnerabilities in ML systems, creating an
urgent need for comprehensive risk assessment for ML-based systems. While
traditional risk assessment frameworks evaluate conventional cybersecurity
risks, they lack ability to address unique challenges posed by AML threats.
Existing AML threat evaluation approaches focus primarily on technical attack
robustness, overlooking crucial real-world factors like deployment
environments, system dependencies, and attack feasibility. Attempts at
comprehensive AML risk assessment have been limited to domain-specific
solutions, preventing application across diverse systems. Addressing these
limitations, we present FRAME, the first comprehensive and automated framework
for assessing AML risks across diverse ML-based systems. FRAME includes a novel
risk assessment method that quantifies AML risks by systematically evaluating
three key dimensions: target system's deployment environment, characteristics
of diverse AML techniques, and empirical insights from prior research. FRAME
incorporates a feasibility scoring mechanism and LLM-based customization for
system-specific assessments. Additionally, we developed a comprehensive
structured dataset of AML attacks enabling context-aware risk assessment. From
an engineering application perspective, FRAME delivers actionable results
designed for direct use by system owners with only technical knowledge of their
systems, without expertise in AML. We validated it across six diverse
real-world applications. Our evaluation demonstrated exceptional accuracy and
strong alignment with analysis by AML experts. FRAME enables organizations to
prioritize AML risks, supporting secure AI deployment in real-world
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了反正则化(AR)方法，通过在小样本情况下增加反向奖励项来提高模型表现力，并随着样本增加按幂规律衰减干预。研究验证了其在回归和分类中的有效性及可实现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本情况下的欠拟合问题，同时保障模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Method: 通过在损失函数中添加带符号反向奖励项，并结合光谱安性与信任区域条件设计稳定性保护措施。对AR的实施进行了理论分析与实践指导。

Result: AR有效减少欠拟合，改善模型泛化性能和校准能力。研究确认了衰减调度与稳定性保障措施在防止过拟合和数值不稳定中的关键作用。

Conclusion: AR方法简单易用，能在数据和资源有限的情况下提升学习鲁棒性，与常规经验风险最小化流程兼容并可复现。

Abstract: We propose Anti-regularization (AR), which adds a sign-reversed reward term
to the loss to intentionally increase model expressivity in the small-sample
regime, and then attenuates this intervention with a power-law decay as the
sample size grows. We formalize spectral safety and trust-region conditions,
and design a lightweight stability safeguard that combines a projection
operator with gradient clipping, ensuring stable intervention under stated
assumptions. Our analysis spans linear smoothers and the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) regime, providing practical guidance on selecting the decay exponent by
balancing empirical risk against variance. Empirically, AR reduces underfitting
while preserving generalization and improving calibration in both regression
and classification. Ablation studies confirm that the decay schedule and the
stability safeguard are critical to preventing overfitting and numerical
instability. We further examine a degrees-of-freedom targeting schedule that
keeps per-sample complexity approximately constant. AR is simple to implement
and reproducible, integrating cleanly into standard empirical risk minimization
pipelines. It enables robust learning in data- and resource-constrained
settings by intervening only when beneficial and fading away when unnecessary.

Result: 实验表明，MMF在图像生成和轨迹建模任务中表现出强大的样本质量、鲁棒收敛性和优秀的泛化能力，尤其是在低数据量或分布外数据场景下。

Conclusion: MMF方法不仅统一并扩展了现有方法，同时在不同任务和数据设置下都表现优异，展现了该方法作为生成建模中新型工具的潜力。

Abstract: One-step generative modeling seeks to generate high-quality data samples in a
single function evaluation, significantly improving efficiency over traditional
diffusion or flow-based models. In this work, we introduce Modular MeanFlow
(MMF), a flexible and theoretically grounded approach for learning
time-averaged velocity fields. Our method derives a family of loss functions
based on a differential identity linking instantaneous and average velocities,
and incorporates a gradient modulation mechanism that enables stable training
without sacrificing expressiveness. We further propose a curriculum-style
warmup schedule to smoothly transition from coarse supervision to fully
differentiable training. The MMF formulation unifies and generalizes existing
consistency-based and flow-matching methods, while avoiding expensive
higher-order derivatives. Empirical results across image synthesis and
trajectory modeling tasks demonstrate that MMF achieves competitive sample
quality, robust convergence, and strong generalization, particularly under
low-data or out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: TreePO为RL模型后续训练提供了一种高效的推理路径，同时减少采样和计算资源，是一种扩展RL训练的现实方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

Motivation: 目标是解决在鲁棒受约束强化学习中，由于强对偶性一般不成立，传统的主-对偶方法可能无法找到最优可行策略的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的算法Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO)，直接基于原始问题，不依赖对偶方法，同时避免了因强对偶性不成立带来的问题。

Result: 理论上保证在一定条件下收敛到近似最优可行策略，实验表明RRPO在面对模型不确定性时，能够实现鲁棒且安全的性能。

Conclusion: RRPO克服了传统方法的不足，为鲁棒受约束强化学习提供了一种有效的解决方案，同时理论上和实验中都验证了其效果。

Abstract: The goal of robust constrained reinforcement learning (RL) is to optimize an
agent's performance under the worst-case model uncertainty while satisfying
safety or resource constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that strong
duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that
traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called
Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the
primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical
convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence
to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching
the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a
specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the
effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe
performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate
the worst-case safety constraints.

Conclusion: ReviBranch通过深度强化学习优化分支变量选择问题，表现出在异质混合整数线性规划实例中的高效性和普适性。

Abstract: The Branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is the main solver for Mixed Integer
Linear Programs (MILPs), where the selection of branching variable is essential
to computational efficiency. However, traditional heuristics for branching
often fail to generalize across heterogeneous problem instances, while existing
learning-based methods such as imitation learning (IL) suffers from dependence
on expert demonstration quality, and reinforcement learning (RL) struggles with
limitations in sparse rewards and dynamic state representation challenges. To
address these issues, we propose ReviBranch, a novel deep RL framework that
constructs revived trajectories by reviving explicit historical correspondences
between branching decisions and their corresponding graph states along
search-tree paths. During training, ReviBranch enables agents to learn from
complete structural evolution and temporal dependencies within the branching
process. Additionally, we introduce an importance-weighted reward
redistribution mechanism that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense
stepwise feedback, addressing the sparse reward challenge. Extensive
experiments on different MILP benchmarks demonstrate that ReviBranch
outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods, reducing B&B nodes by 4.0% and LP
iterations by 2.2% on large-scale instances. The results highlight the
robustness and generalizability of ReviBranch across heterogeneous MILP problem
classes.

Abstract: Classification in the context of multi-label data streams represents a

changes in the data distribution (concept drift), the emergence of new labels
(concept evolution), and the latency in the arrival of ground truth labels.
This systematic literature review presents an in-depth analysis of multi-label
data stream classification proposals. We characterize the latest methods in the
literature, providing a comprehensive overview, building a thorough hierarchy,
and discussing how the proposals approach each problem. Furthermore, we discuss
the adopted evaluation strategies and analyze the methods' asymptotic
complexity and resource consumption. Finally, we identify the main gaps and
offer recommendations for future research directions in the field.

Motivation: 对抗样本现象长期缺乏统一解释，本文尝试结合机械解释学中的叠加概念来解释这一现象。

Method: 通过理论分析、玩具模型和ResNet18实验，探讨叠加与对抗样本鲁棒性之间的关系，并通过干预实验验证两者互相影响的机制。

Result: 实验表明，干预叠加可以控制鲁棒性，干预鲁棒性（如通过对抗训练）可以控制叠加，支持叠加为对抗样本核心机制的假设。

Conclusion: 叠加可能是导致对抗样本的主要机制，研究对抗样本的鲁棒性和叠加之间的关系有助于深入理解深度学习网络的运作机制。

Abstract: Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool
neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena
despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations
have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One
underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic
interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary
cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly
extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can
theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models,
intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models,
intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition,
and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training)
controls superposition.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have enabled the scaling of Large Language

counts while maintaining computational efficiency. However, MoEs introduce
several inference-time challenges, including load imbalance across experts and
the additional routing computational overhead. To address these challenges and

*Martin Käppel,Julian Neuberger,Felix Möhrlein,Sven Weinzierl,Martin Matzner,Stefan Jablonski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过人机交互方式处理预测业务流程模型中的偏见，即使同一敏感属性同时作为公平和不公平的依据时，也能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测业务流程监控模型中存在基于敏感属性的偏见问题，这种偏见可能导致不公平的预测结果，现有解决方案通常完全移除敏感属性，但这可能不可行。

Method: 本文提出一种新的模型无关方法，利用从原始模型提炼出的决策树，通过与人类交互的方式区分公平和不公平决策并进行修正。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在存在有偏数据的情况下，在公平性和预测准确性之间达成了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过提出的一种基于决策树的交互模型方法，可以有效识别并修正预测过程中的偏向决策，增强了模型的公平性，同时保持了较高的性能。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring enables organizations to proactively react and
intervene in running instances of a business process. Given an incomplete
process instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining
time are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have
shown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of
these models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical
patterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on
so-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process
participants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions
that mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process
instance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in
the same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment
decisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient
should not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic
approach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business
process monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both
fairly and unfairly. The proposed approach uses a human-in-the-loop approach to
differentiate between fair and unfair decisions through simple alterations on a
decision tree model distilled from the original prediction model. Our results
show that the proposed approach achieves a promising tradeoff between fairness
and accuracy in the presence of biased data. All source code and data are

### [453] [Multimodal Representation Learning Conditioned on Semantic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17497)
*Yang Qiao,Yuntong Hu,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了RCML，一个基于关系驱动的多模态学习框架，解决了现有模型在利用语义关系、语境化全局嵌入和跨模态/模态内一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态对比学习模型（如CLIP）存在以下不足：1. 未充分挖掘不同图文对的语义关系；2. 忽视在特定子空间或关系维度上的语义对齐需求；3. 注重跨模态对比，支持模态内一致性有限。

Method: 提出了一种关系驱动的训练框架RCML，利用自然语言关系描述指导特征提取与对齐，构造多对多语义相关的训练对，采用关系引导的交叉注意机制，并通过结合跨模态与模态内对比损失来增强一致性。

Result: 实验表明，RCML在多数据集上的检索与分类任务中表现优于强基线，验证了基于语义关系指导多模态表示学习的有效性。

Conclusion: RCML证明了利用语义关系优化多模态表示可以显著提升表征学习性能，丰富了多模态学习领域的研究方法。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning has advanced rapidly with contrastive
models such as CLIP, which align image-text pairs in a shared embedding space.
However, these models face limitations: (1) they typically focus on image-text
pairs, underutilizing the semantic relations across different pairs. (2) they
directly match global embeddings without contextualization, overlooking the
need for semantic alignment along specific subspaces or relational dimensions;
and (3) they emphasize cross-modal contrast, with limited support for
intra-modal consistency. To address these issues, we propose
Relation-Conditioned Multimodal Learning RCML, a framework that learns
multimodal representations under natural-language relation descriptions to
guide both feature extraction and alignment. Our approach constructs
many-to-many training pairs linked by semantic relations and introduces a
relation-guided cross-attention mechanism that modulates multimodal
representations under each relation context. The training objective combines
inter-modal and intra-modal contrastive losses, encouraging consistency across
both modalities and semantically related samples. Experiments on different
datasets show that RCML consistently outperforms strong baselines on both
retrieval and classification tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of
leveraging semantic relations to guide multimodal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是扩展DLNs的应用场景，将其用于时间序列分类领域，以利用其在分类任务中的准确性、可解释性和计算效率。

Method: 采用Catch22和TSFresh进行特征提取，将时间序列转换为向量形式并适配DLN分类；融合训练配置至超参数搜索空间，自动选择最佳配置。同时分析选定配置的分布以理解DLN训练动态。

Result: 在51个公开的单变量时间序列分类基准测试中，DLNs在新的领域中保持了核心优势：竞争性的准确率、低推理成本、以及透明的可解释决策逻辑。

Conclusion: 研究表明，DLNs在时间序列分类领域中同样表现优异，保持了其在表格分类和回归任务中的优点，证明其迁移能力及广泛适用性。

Abstract: Differentiable logic networks (DLNs) have shown promising results in tabular
domains by combining accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
In this work, we apply DLNs to the domain of TSC for the first time, focusing
on univariate datasets. To enable DLN application in this context, we adopt
feature-based representations relying on Catch22 and TSFresh, converting
sequential time series into vectorized forms suitable for DLN classification.
Unlike prior DLN studies that fix the training configuration and vary various
settings in isolation via ablation, we integrate all such configurations into
the hyperparameter search space, enabling the search process to select jointly
optimal settings. We then analyze the distribution of selected configurations
to better understand DLN training dynamics. We evaluate our approach on 51
publicly available univariate TSC benchmarks. The results confirm that
classification DLNs maintain their core strengths in this new domain: they
deliver competitive accuracy, retain low inference cost, and provide
transparent, interpretable decision logic, thus aligning well with previous DLN
findings in the realm of tabular classification and regression tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种改进的MoE模型，利用新的注意力机制简化训练流程，同时提升预测准确性和计算效率，适用于间歇信号的长短期时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前存在的MoE模型训练复杂，且需要辅助平衡损失及路由参数调优，限制了其实用性。准确预测时间序列，尤其是间歇性信号，在能源市场、物联网等方面应用广泛，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种基于稀疏MoE的新型架构，引入了创新的注意力驱动的 gating 机制，取代了传统的单层 softmax 路由器，简化了训练过程。同时优化了参数利用，使模型能更高效地进行长短期时间序列预测。

Result: 提出的新MoE模型在参数数量更少的情况下，性能优于目前的Transformer（如PatchTST）和LSTM模型。此外，在多个数据集上的实验显示，模型在长短期预测中具有更高的计算效率和精度。

Conclusion: 这种改进的MoE架构不仅简化了训练过程，还显著提升了预测性能和计算效率，为兼具准确性和经济性的时间序列预测提供了有效的方案。

Abstract: Accurate univariate forecasting remains a pressing need in real-world
systems, such as energy markets, hydrology, retail demand, and IoT monitoring,
where signals are often intermittent and horizons span both short- and
long-term. While transformers and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
increasingly favored for time-series forecasting, a key gap persists: MoE
models typically require complicated training with both the main forecasting
loss and auxiliary load-balancing losses, along with careful
routing/temperature tuning, which hinders practical adoption. In this paper, we
propose a model architecture that simplifies the training process for
univariate time series forecasting and effectively addresses both long- and
short-term horizons, including intermittent patterns. Our approach combines
sparse MoE computation with a novel attention-inspired gating mechanism that
replaces the traditional one-layer softmax router. Through extensive empirical
evaluation, we demonstrate that our gating design naturally promotes balanced
expert utilization and achieves superior predictive accuracy without requiring
the auxiliary load-balancing losses typically used in classical MoE
implementations. The model achieves better performance while utilizing only a
fraction of the parameters required by state-of-the-art transformer models,
such as PatchTST. Furthermore, experiments across diverse datasets confirm that
our MoE architecture with the proposed gating mechanism is more computationally
efficient than LSTM for both long- and short-term forecasting, enabling
cost-effective inference. These results highlight the potential of our approach
for practical time-series forecasting applications where both accuracy and
computational efficiency are critical.

Result: 在30个基准数据集及一个医疗数据集上，TANDEM都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TANDEM不仅提高了分类准确性，还为处理缺失数据提供了实用洞见。

Abstract: Handling missing data in time series classification remains a significant
challenge in various domains. Traditional methods often rely on imputation,
which may introduce bias or fail to capture the underlying temporal dynamics.
In this paper, we propose TANDEM (Temporal Attention-guided Neural Differential
Equations for Missingness), an attention-guided neural differential equation
framework that effectively classifies time series data with missing values. Our
approach integrates raw observation, interpolated control path, and continuous
latent dynamics through a novel attention mechanism, allowing the model to
focus on the most informative aspects of the data. We evaluate TANDEM on 30
benchmark datasets and a real-world medical dataset, demonstrating its
superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our framework not only
improves classification accuracy but also provides insights into the handling
of missing data, making it a valuable tool in practice.

Abstract: Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often
irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and
anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic
Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling
with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular
observations. Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a
numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse
sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate
strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical
events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a
principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图同质性被认为是MPNN中重要的特性，但最近发现性能更依赖于邻居类别分布的一致性，因此作者希望进一步探索这之间的关联。

Method: 通过分析类别内部邻居分布的组成部分，提出了一种基于Gumbel-Softmax的重连方法，旨在减少邻居分布的偏差，同时增强图的邻居信息度。

Result: 新的方法提高了邻域信息度，解决了长距离依赖问题，减轻了现有MPNN中出现的过度压缩现象，并显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 通过对邻居分布的优化，证明了邻域信息度的改善能够有效提高MPNN的性能，同时提供了一种优雅的框架解决图结构中的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Graph homophily has been considered an essential property for message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) in node classification. Recent findings suggest that
performance is more closely tied to the consistency of neighborhood class
distributions. We demonstrate that the MPNN performance depends on the number
of components of the overall neighborhood distribution within a class. By
breaking down the classes into their neighborhood distribution components, we
increase measures of neighborhood distribution informativeness but do not
observe an improvement in MPNN performance. We propose a Gumbel-Softmax-based
rewiring method that reduces deviations in neighborhood distributions. Our
results show that our new method enhances neighborhood informativeness, handles
long-range dependencies, mitigates oversquashing, and increases the
classification performance of the MPNN. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解残差流中特征的传输机制可带来更好的模型安全防护、错误的早期发现及其修正手段。

Method: 提出线性运算符ATO，可从特征空间评估上下游层间特征的线性传输或非线性特征生成。使用下游SAE解码器映射进行实验，并提出了传输效率的概念。

Result: 实验证明了线性传输的存在，报告了传输效率以及与线性传输相关的残差流子空间大小。

Conclusion: 方法计算量小（无需微调，GPU时间<50小时），为模型安全、调试及LLM线性计算行为的理解提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The residual stream mediates communication between transformer decoder layers
via linear reads and writes of non-linear computations. While sparse-dictionary
learning-based methods locate features in the residual stream, and activation
patching methods discover circuits within the model, the mechanism by which
features flow through the residual stream remains understudied. Understanding
this dynamic can better inform jailbreaking protections, enable early detection
of model mistakes, and their correction. In this work, we propose Activation
Transport Operators (ATO), linear maps from upstream to downstream residuals
$k$ layers later, evaluated in feature space using downstream SAE decoder
projections. We empirically demonstrate that these operators can determine
whether a feature has been linearly transported from a previous layer or
synthesised from non-linear layer computation. We develop the notion of
transport efficiency, for which we provide an upper bound, and use it to
estimate the size of the residual stream subspace that corresponds to linear
transport. We empirically demonstrate the linear transport, report transport
efficiency and the size of the residual stream's subspace involved in linear
transport. This compute-light (no finetuning, <50 GPU-h) method offers
practical tools for safety, debugging, and a clearer picture of where
computation in LLMs behaves linearly.

Motivation: 探索Transformer是否能通过提示实现高效的算法计算,并将其作为通用算法库使用。

Result: 证实了单一注意力头的Transformer通过提示能够精确模拟多种算法输出。

Conclusion: 提示机制可以实现扩展Transformer为算法库,展现了算法普适性的新方向。

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer architecture with frozen weights is
capable of emulating a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. In
particular, for any algorithm implementable by a fixed-weight attention head
(e.g. one-step gradient descent or linear/ridge regression), there exists a
prompt that drives a two-layer softmax attention module to reproduce the
algorithm's output with arbitrary precision. This guarantee extends even to a
single-head attention layer (using longer prompts if necessary), achieving
architectural minimality. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an
algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product
gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This
construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All
adaptation happens through the prompt alone. These findings forge a direct link
between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple
mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of
algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms
via prompts alone, establishing a form of algorithmic universality in modern
Transformer models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测ICU患者的住院时间对医院资源管理至关重要，但电子健康记录的异质性和不规则性使任务充满挑战。

Method: 提出S$^2$G-Net模型，结合Mamba状态空间模型和优化后的GraphGPS架构，利用诊断、行政和语义特征生成的异质性患者相似性图进行预测。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的实验表明，S$^2$G-Net在各主要指标上均优于现有序列模型、图模型及混合模型。

Conclusion: S$^2$G-Net通过有效整合多模态临床数据，为ICU住院时间预测提供了可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic
features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that
S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability
analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our
architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction.
These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable
solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

Conclusion: LoRA和DoRA适用于小型语言模型，验证了其低秩特性及效率优势，为资源受限的团队提供了模型训练新突破。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial
intelligence, fine-tuning LLMs is extraordinarily computationally expensive,
preventing smaller businesses and research teams with limited GPU resources
from engaging with new research. Hu et al and Liu et al introduce Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) as highly
efficient and performant solutions to the computational challenges of LLM
fine-tuning, demonstrating huge speedups and memory usage savings for models
such as GPT-3 and RoBERTa. We seek to expand upon the original LoRA and DoRA
papers by benchmarking efficiency and performance of LoRA and DoRA when applied
to a much smaller scale of language model: our case study here is the compact
minBERT model. Our findings reveal that optimal custom configurations of LoRA
and DoRA, coupled with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), significantly enhance
training efficiency without compromising performance. Furthermore, while the
parameterization of minBERT is significantly smaller than GPT-3, our results
validate the observation that gradient updates to language models are
inherently low-rank even in small model space, observing that rank 1
decompositions yield negligible performance deficits. Furthermore, aided by our
highly efficient minBERT implementation, we investigate numerous architectures,
custom loss functions, and hyperparameters to ultimately train an optimal
ensembled multitask minBERT model to simultaneously perform sentiment analysis,
paraphrase detection, and similarity scoring.

Conclusion: 通过数据多样化和新型奖励机制的结合，有效改善了图表到代码生成任务中的数据和视觉一致性问题，提供了一种更优的新方法。

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into
executable code. This task faces two major challenges: limited data diversity
and insufficient maintenance of visual consistency between generated and
original charts during training. Existing datasets mainly rely on seed data to
prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples. To
address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, which leverages real-world,
human-designed charts from arXiv papers as prompts instead of synthetic seeds.
Using the diverse styles and rich content of arXiv charts, we construct
ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset. Another challenge
is that although SFT effectively improve code understanding, it often fails to
ensure that generated charts are visually consistent with the originals. To
address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning
algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of
attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes such as
layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual
similarity, which assesses similarity in texture and other overall visual
features using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based
rewards such as accuracy or format rewards, our reward considers the multimodal
nature of the chart-to-code task and effectively enhances the model's ability
to accurately reproduce charts. By integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we
develop the ChartMaster model, which achieves state-of-the-art results among
7B-parameter models and even rivals GPT-4o on various chart-to-code generation
benchmarks. All resources are available at

Result: 比较实验表明，PILF模型在高维稀疏矩阵中的表现优越。

Conclusion: PILF模型能够有效改进SGD-LFA方法的收敛速度和泛化性能，在高维稀疏矩阵场景表现优异。

Abstract: In industrial big data scenarios, high-dimensional sparse matrices (HDI) are
widely used to characterize high-order interaction relationships among massive
nodes. The stochastic gradient descent-based latent factor analysis (SGD-LFA)
method can effectively extract deep feature information embedded in HDI
matrices. However, existing SGD-LFA methods exhibit significant limitations:
their parameter update process relies solely on the instantaneous gradient
information of current samples, failing to incorporate accumulated experiential
knowledge from historical iterations or account for intrinsic correlations
between samples, resulting in slow convergence speed and suboptimal
generalization performance. Thus, this paper proposes a PILF model by
developing a PI-accelerated SGD algorithm by integrating correlated instances
and refining learning errors through proportional-integral (PI) control
mechanism that current and historical information; Comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior representation capability of the PILF model on HDI
matrices

Conclusion: QGAT不仅在处理结构复杂性和噪声问题上展现了显著效果，其模块化设计还能够增强和扩展现有的基于注意力的经典模型。

Abstract: We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural
network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention
mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with
amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions.
Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each
head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate
multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter
sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model
complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are
optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to
learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing
complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive
scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning
across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore,
experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature
and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data.
The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing
architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting
the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where
data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and
labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in
point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to
the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators
with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for
enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views.
These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing
specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter
traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional
generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy,
providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results
indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not
only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development
of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is
anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving
the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that remains
challenging to predict due to its multifactorial etiology and the complexity of
multimodal clinical data. Accurate forecasting of clinically relevant
biomarkers, including diagnostic and quantitative measures, is essential for
effective monitoring of disease progression. This work introduces L2C-TabPFN, a
method that integrates a longitudinal-to-cross-sectional (L2C) transformation
with a pre-trained Tabular Foundation Model (TabPFN) to predict Alzheimer's
disease outcomes using the TADPOLE dataset. L2C-TabPFN converts sequential
patient records into fixed-length feature vectors, enabling robust prediction
of diagnosis, cognitive scores, and ventricular volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that, while L2C-TabPFN achieves competitive performance on
diagnostic and cognitive outcomes, it provides state-of-the-art results in
ventricular volume prediction. This key imaging biomarker reflects
neurodegeneration and progression in Alzheimer's disease. These findings
highlight the potential of tabular foundational models for advancing
longitudinal prediction of clinically relevant imaging markers in Alzheimer's
disease.

Motivation: 旨在解决如何将异质领域中的元素通过嵌入方式可视化，并保留原始的关系依赖结构。

Method: 通过最大化互信息来嵌入元素至潜在空间中，同时提出条件概率着色方法用于交互式关系探索。支持多领域扩展。

Result: 该方法在形容词-名词、NeurIPS、主谓宾数据集上的应用证实了其在域内和域间分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 此嵌入与可视化方法在保持数据结构的同时，提供了探索异质领域间不对称关系的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an embedding method for co-occurrence data aimed at
visual information exploration. We consider cases where co-occurrence
probabilities are measured between pairs of elements from heterogeneous
domains. The proposed method maps these heterogeneous elements into
corresponding two-dimensional latent spaces, enabling visualization of
asymmetric relationships between the domains. The key idea is to embed the
elements in a way that maximizes their mutual information, thereby preserving
the original dependency structure as much as possible. This approach can be
naturally extended to cases involving three or more domains, using a
generalization of mutual information known as total correlation. For
inter-domain analysis, we also propose a visualization method that assigns
colors to the latent spaces based on conditional probabilities, allowing users
to explore asymmetric relationships interactively. We demonstrate the utility
of the method through applications to an adjective-noun dataset, the NeurIPS
dataset, and a subject-verb-object dataset, showcasing both intra- and
inter-domain analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了利用生成式多模态大型语言模型 (MLLMs) 生成认知评估合成规范数据的可行性，为现有图像认知测试提供支持并解决传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可用的规范数据，新开发基于图像的认知测试面临极大挑战，而传统数据收集方法成本高、耗时久且更新少，因此需要新的方法支持认知评估。

Method: 研究利用GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini生成性语言模型，采用简单和高级两种不同提示策略，为“Cookie Theft”图片描述任务产生文本回答，并用多种指标和LLMs评分评估生成内容区分诊断群体和人口多样性的能力。

Result: 高级提示策略生成的合成响应效果更佳，更能区分诊断组并反映人口多样性；BERTScore是评估上下文相似度最可靠的指标，而BLEU在创造性输出评估方面效果较弱；“LLM-as-a-judge”方法初步验证显示前景良好。

Conclusion: 通过改进的提示方法指导的生成模型可用于生成稳健的认知评估合成数据，从而为新型基于图像的认知测试开发铺平道路，解决传统方法的种种限制。

Abstract: Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for
evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based
on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available
normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming,
and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements
in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to
generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We
investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and
GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established
image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture
description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic
instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were
evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to
distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics
included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced
prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively
distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity
compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting
higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for
contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating
creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary
validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs,
guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic
normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for
developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional
limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiKMiX 提供了一种动态调整语言模型预训练数据混合比例的方法，通过评估数据域的影响力优化分布，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态数据混合策略在语言模型训练中表现不足，因为模型对不同数据域的偏好在训练过程中会动态变化。解决方法需要经济高效地观察这些变化以优化性能。

Method: 提出了TiKMiX方法，定义了一种名为Group Influence的指标来有效测量数据域对模型的影响。利用该指标解决优化问题，通过TiKMiX-D直接优化，或通过TiKMiX-M使用回归模型预测更优的数据混合。

Result: 实验表明，TiKMiX-D在使用仅20%计算资源的情况下超越了SOTA方法如REGMIX。而TiKMiX-M则在9个下游任务中平均性能提升了2%。

Conclusion: 动态调整数据混合在训练时基于模型偏好的变化，可以显著提升模型性能，避免静态比例下的“消化不良”问题。

Abstract: The data mixture used in the pre-training of a language model is a
cornerstone of its final performance. However, a static mixing strategy is
suboptimal, as the model's learning preferences for various data domains shift
dynamically throughout training. Crucially, observing these evolving
preferences in a computationally efficient manner remains a significant
challenge. To address this, we propose TiKMiX, a method that dynamically
adjusts the data mixture according to the model's evolving preferences. TiKMiX
introduces Group Influence, an efficient metric for evaluating the impact of
data domains on the model. This metric enables the formulation of the data
mixing problem as a search for an optimal, influence-maximizing distribution.
We solve this via two approaches: TiKMiX-D for direct optimization, and
TiKMiX-M, which uses a regression model to predict a superior mixture. We
trained models with different numbers of parameters, on up to 1 trillion
tokens. TiKMiX-D exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods like
REGMIX while using just 20% of the computational resources. TiKMiX-M leads to
an average performance gain of 2% across 9 downstream benchmarks. Our
experiments reveal that a model's data preferences evolve with training
progress and scale, and we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the data
mixture based on Group Influence, a direct measure of these preferences,
significantly improves performance by mitigating the underdigestion of data
seen with static ratios.

Result: 为基于Mamba的SSM在GPU上的运行性能提供了分析，并揭示了相关的性能优化方向。

Conclusion: 研究为持续提升SSM模型的性能提供了指导，并强调了其在微架构设计中的要求。

Abstract: Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，基于适配器的新方法在不同骨干架构及对抗训练规模下表现有效，能够同时兼顾效率和鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) with projected gradient descent is the most popular
method to improve model robustness under adversarial attacks. However,
computational overheads become prohibitively large when AT is applied to large
backbone models. AT is also known to have the issue of robust overfitting. This
paper contributes to solving both problems simultaneously towards building more
trustworthy foundation models. In particular, we propose a new adapter-based
approach for efficient AT directly in the feature space. We show that the
proposed adapter-based approach can improve the inner-loop convergence quality
by eliminating robust overfitting. As a result, it significantly increases
computational efficiency and improves model accuracy by generalizing
adversarial robustness to unseen attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the new adapter-based approach in different backbone architectures and in AT at
scale.

Motivation: 鉴于AI在科学领域中可能带来的突破性影响，需要通过明确的方法，验证LLMs是否真正具有创造性地生成新知识的能力。

Method: 提出通过系统性移除目标结果及其相关信息，再评估模型是否能够仅依赖许可的公理和工具重新推导结果的方法，被称为“通过遗忘进行切除”。

Result: 提出的方法可以区分模型是仅仅记忆还是能够构造性地产生新科学知识，同时为AI科学发现能力的界限研究提供框架。

Conclusion: “通过遗忘进行切除”可作为AI科学发现的基准测试，为区分模型能力及其限制提供原则性框架。

Abstract: Bold claims about AI's role in science-from "AGI will cure all diseases" to
promises of radically accelerated discovery-raise a central epistemic question:
do large language models (LLMs) truly generate new knowledge, or do they merely
remix memorized fragments? We propose unlearning-as-ablation as a falsifiable
test of constructive scientific discovery. The method systematically removes a
target result and its entire forget-closure (lemmas, paraphrases, and multi-hop
entailments) and then evaluates whether the model can re-derive the result from
only permitted axioms and tools. Success provides evidence for genuine
generative capability; failure exposes current limits. Unlike prevailing
motivations for unlearning-privacy, copyright, or safety-our framing
repositions it as an epistemic probe for AI-for-Science. We argue that such
tests could serve as the next generation of benchmarks, much as ImageNet
catalyzed progress in vision: distinguishing models that can merely recall from
those that can constructively generate new scientific knowledge. We outline a
minimal pilot in mathematics and algorithms, and discuss extensions to physics,
chemistry, and biology. Whether models succeed or fail, unlearning-as-ablation
provides a principled framework to map the true reach and limits of AI
scientific discovery. This is a position paper: we advance a conceptual and
methodological argument rather than new empirical results.

Abstract: When do diffusion models reproduce their training data, and when are they
able to generate samples beyond it? A practically relevant theoretical
understanding of this interplay between memorization and generalization may
significantly impact real-world deployments of diffusion models with respect to
issues such as copyright infringement and data privacy. In this work, to
disentangle the different factors that influence memorization and
generalization in practical diffusion models, we introduce a scientific and
mathematical "laboratory" for investigating these phenomena in diffusion models
trained on fully synthetic or natural image-like structured data. Within this
setting, we hypothesize that the memorization or generalization behavior of an
underparameterized trained model is determined by the difference in training
loss between an associated memorizing model and a generalizing model. To probe
this hypothesis, we theoretically characterize a crossover point wherein the
weighted training loss of a fully generalizing model becomes greater than that
of an underparameterized memorizing model at a critical value of model
(under)parameterization. We then demonstrate via carefully-designed experiments
that the location of this crossover predicts a phase transition in diffusion
models trained via gradient descent, validating our hypothesis. Ultimately, our
theory enables us to analytically predict the model size at which memorization
becomes predominant. Our work provides an analytically tractable and
practically meaningful setting for future theoretical and empirical
investigations. Code for our experiments is available at

Conclusion: 空中计算可以有效支持大规模联邦学习，理论结果经实验验证具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, its performance is often
constrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems
supporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating
over-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising
solution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly
increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by
transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital
ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced
distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global
parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical
framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in
large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of
scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The
mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's
aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2)
Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the
impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved
Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the
convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a
viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of
clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive
experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is capable of accurate Load Forecasting from complete

Learning with Gaussian Copula to deal with sparsity, which contains three
modules: data complementation, ML construction, and adaptive ensemble. First,

models to make predictions individually. Finally, it employs adaptive ensemble
to get final weighted-sum result. Experiments have demonstrated that our model
are robust.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in
bioengineering and biological research, significantly accelerating discovery
processes. However, this advancement introduces critical concerns regarding
intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we propose the
first robust watermarking method designed for molecules, which utilizes
atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to
ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method using the datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUG,

embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root

Motivation: 目前大型语言模型存在被利用进行"越狱攻击"的风险，现有的模型调整方法成本高昂且难以保证性能一致性，因此需要新的轻量化方式增强模型安全性。

Method: 提出SSD方法，通过结合小型模型和大型模型的分布，动态调整解码策略，以权衡效用和安全属性，并引入推测性采样以加速推理时间。

Result: 实验显示SSD不仅成功为大型语言模型加入目标安全属性，同时在处理一般性查询时仍能保持有用性，并显著缩短推理时间。

Conclusion: SSD是一种高效且安全的增强方法，为大型语言模型提供额外防护，并有助于优化推理速度。

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities
continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with
additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning
large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty
ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding
(SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired
safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a
small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates
speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the
small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to
dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to
handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then
sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original
and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips
the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to
remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference
time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望探索截断文本嵌入对下游任务性能的影响，以及理解文本编码的特性。

Method: 通过对6个先进的文本编码器和26个下游任务实验，分析删除部分嵌入维度对性能的影响。同时对生成任务中的结果进行了拓展测试。

Result: 发现移除大部分嵌入维度后性能下降小，且部分均匀分布维度的去除甚至提高了性能。此外，这一现象在生成任务中也得到了验证。

Conclusion: 删除嵌入维度对性能的有限影响并非来自无效表示，而是某些噪声维度的存在反而抑制了性能。因此削减嵌入维度不仅有助于紧凑表示，还提供了改进性能的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the surprising impact that truncating text embeddings
has on downstream performance. We consistently observe across 6
state-of-the-art text encoders and 26 downstream tasks, that randomly removing
up to 50% of embedding dimensions results in only a minor drop in performance,
less than 10%, in retrieval and classification tasks. Given the benefits of
using smaller-sized embeddings, as well as the potential insights about text
encoding, we study this phenomenon and find that, contrary to what is suggested
in prior work, this is not the result of an ineffective use of representation
space. Instead, we find that a large number of uniformly distributed dimensions
actually cause an increase in performance when removed. This would explain why,
on average, removing a large number of embedding dimensions results in a
marginal drop in performance. We make similar observations when truncating the
embeddings used by large language models to make next-token predictions on
generative tasks, suggesting that this phenomenon is not isolated to
classification or retrieval tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces MANGO (Multilayer Abstraction for Nested Generation of
Options), a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to
address the challenges of long-term sparse reward environments. MANGO
decomposes complex tasks into multiple layers of abstraction, where each layer
defines an abstract state space and employs options to modularize trajectories
into macro-actions. These options are nested across layers, allowing for
efficient reuse of learned movements and improved sample efficiency. The
framework introduces intra-layer policies that guide the agent's transitions
within the abstract state space, and task actions that integrate task-specific
components such as reward functions. Experiments conducted in
procedurally-generated grid environments demonstrate substantial improvements
in both sample efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to standard
RL methods. MANGO also enhances interpretability by making the agent's
decision-making process transparent across layers, which is particularly
valuable in safety-critical and industrial applications. Future work will
explore automated discovery of abstractions and abstract actions, adaptation to
continuous or fuzzy environments, and more robust multi-layer training
strategies.

Result: 在不同基准测试上，SuperGen能获得最大性能提升，同时输出质量高。

Conclusion: SuperGen框架无需额外训练即可克服超高清生成挑战，同时大幅提高生成速度与效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative
tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality
content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains.
However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing
standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the
excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and
memory costs. To this end, we introduce SuperGen, an efficient tile-based
framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SuperGen features a novel
training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide
range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly
reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SuperGen
incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that
accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps
and spatial regions. SuperGen also integrates cache-guided,
communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized
latency. Evaluations demonstrate that SuperGen harvests the maximum performance
gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

*Jelke Wibbeke,Nico Schönfisch,Sebastian Rohjans,Andreas Rauh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究回归问题中的校准指标和方法，通过系统地梳理和分类文献中的校准指标，并在多种实验数据下评估，发现指标之间存在显著的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键任务中，不仅要求数据驱动模型具有高精度，还需要提供可靠的不确定性估计。校准是实现风险感知决策的重要因素，但现有的校准指标和方法定义及假设差异较大，难以进行有效比较，缺乏一致性评估。

Method: 作者对文献中的回归校准指标进行了系统分类，并设计受控实验，通过真实、合成及人为失准数据，独立评估不同校准方法和指标的表现。

Result: 实验表明，不同校准指标在对同一调整结果的评价上常有冲突，有些甚至得出相反结论。ENCE和CWC被确定为评估中最可靠的指标。

Conclusion: 指标选择对校准研究至关重要，不一致的指标可能导致结果呈现具有误导性的成功印象。

Abstract: In safety-critical applications data-driven models must not only be accurate
but also provide reliable uncertainty estimates. This property, commonly
referred to as calibration, is essential for risk-aware decision-making. In
regression a wide variety of calibration metrics and recalibration methods have
emerged. However, these metrics differ significantly in their definitions,
assumptions and scales, making it difficult to interpret and compare results
across studies. Moreover, most recalibration methods have been evaluated using
only a small subset of metrics, leaving it unclear whether improvements
generalize across different notions of calibration. In this work, we
systematically extract and categorize regression calibration metrics from the
literature and benchmark these metrics independently of specific modelling
methods or recalibration approaches. Through controlled experiments with
real-world, synthetic and artificially miscalibrated data, we demonstrate that
calibration metrics frequently produce conflicting results. Our analysis
reveals substantial inconsistencies: many metrics disagree in their evaluation
of the same recalibration result, and some even indicate contradictory
conclusions. This inconsistency is particularly concerning as it potentially
allows cherry-picking of metrics to create misleading impressions of success.
We identify the Expected Normalized Calibration Error (ENCE) and the Coverage
Width-based Criterion (CWC) as the most dependable metrics in our tests. Our
findings highlight the critical role of metric selection in calibration
research.

*Duseok Kang,Yunseong Lee,Junghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 随着移动设备使用深度学习模型的增多，硬件异构性增加。本文提出一种基于遗传算法的方法（Puzzle）来优化多模型深度学习网络在异构处理器上的调度，表现出显著的性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大部分研究局限于单模型场景，忽略硬件/软件配置性能差异及执行时间估算问题，而无法满足实际多模型场景需求。

Method: 提出基于遗传算法的方法，利用三种染色体类型进行分区/映射/优先级探索，并通过设备内实时分析实现准确执行时间估计。

Result: 在包含9种深度学习网络的随机场景中，Puzzle显著提高请求频率，较基准方法NPU Only和Best Mapping分别提高3.7倍和2.2倍，且满足实时性要求。

Conclusion: 通过创新的遗传算法技术和设备内实时分析手段，Puzzle提供了一种高效调度深度学习工作负载的解决方案，在异构硬件环境中表现卓越。

Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed on mobile devices, modern
mobile devices incorporate deep learning-specific accelerators to handle the
growing computational demands, thus increasing their hardware heterogeneity.
However, existing works on scheduling deep learning workloads across these
processors have significant limitations: most studies focus on single-model
scenarios rather than realistic multi-model scenarios, overlook performance
variations from different hardware/software configurations, and struggle with
accurate execution time estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel genetic algorithm-based methodology for scheduling multiple deep learning
networks on heterogeneous processors by partitioning the networks into multiple
subgraphs. Our approach incorporates three different types of chromosomes for
partition/mapping/priority exploration, and leverages device-in-the-loop
profiling and evaluation for accurate execution time estimation. Based on this
methodology, our system, Puzzle, demonstrates superior performance in extensive
evaluations with randomly generated scenarios involving nine state-of-the-art
networks. The results demonstrate Puzzle can support 3.7 and 2.2 times higher
request frequency on average compared to the two heuristic baselines, NPU Only
and Best Mapping, respectively, while satisfying the equivalent level of
real-time requirements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信任域思想的监督微调方法PSFT，可用于稳定优化和提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基础模型监督微调往往导致泛化能力下降，而信任域优化方法在强化学习中展现了对策略偏移的约束能力。

Method: 将监督微调视为一种策略梯度方法，通过引入信任域约束研发了PSFT，在保持竞争性调优的同时，限制策略偏移。

Result: 实验表明，PSFT在数学和人类价值领域达到了与SFT相当的域内性能，在域外泛化性能上表现优异，且经过长时间训练后仍保持稳定，无熵崩塌现象。

Conclusion: PSFT有效稳定了优化过程，提升了模型的泛化能力，同时为后续训练提供了更强的基础。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of foundation models often leads to poor
generalization, where prior capabilities deteriorate after tuning on new tasks
or domains. Inspired by trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) and proximal
policy optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose Proximal
SFT (PSFT). This fine-tuning objective incorporates the benefits of
trust-region, effectively constraining policy drift during SFT while
maintaining competitive tuning. By viewing SFT as a special case of policy
gradient methods with constant positive advantages, we derive PSFT that
stabilizes optimization and leads to generalization, while leaving room for
further optimization in subsequent post-training stages. Experiments across
mathematical and human-value domains show that PSFT matches SFT in-domain,
outperforms it in out-of-domain generalization, remains stable under prolonged
training without causing entropy collapse, and provides a stronger foundation
for the subsequent optimization.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了注意力机制中归一化的局限性，提供理论框架分析并通过实验验证模型选择性和几何分离的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在探明注意力机制的归一化如何限制模型区分和选择有效信息的能力。

Method: 提出理论框架，分析基于softmax缩放的token间距离和分离标准，并通过GPT-2模型的实验验证。

Result: 发现当选择的token数量增加时，模型难以区分信息性token，表现趋于均匀选择；低温下softmax归一化的梯度敏感性影响训练效果。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对softmax归一化的理解，并指出未来需要引入更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Conclusion: 通过提升高阶同质性和重接线，显著改善了MPNN在各类图上分类性能，同时提供诊断与改进工具，有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node
classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low
same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a
unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily
and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN
representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent
parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity
to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation
of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low
higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural
bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph
ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking
into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and
oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with
closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising
higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and
two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based
rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across
all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on
real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs
typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the
literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use,
provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet
effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph
modification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单中心计算能力受限，分布式训练成为必要。而强化学习在异质分布环境中因抽样和参数学习之间的耦合面临困难，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出HeteroRL异步架构，将抽样和参数学习解耦并允许在分布式节点中部署；引入GEPO算法，通过精细的抽样机制减少重要性权重方差。

Result: GEPO理论上实现指数级方差减少，实验显示在长延迟(1800秒)下，性能劣化低于3%，表现出优越稳定性。

Conclusion: HeteroRL和GEPO展示了强化学习在异质分布式网络中的强大潜力，为处理网络延迟下的RL训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized
training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training
enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous
distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning
alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that
decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment
across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that
latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high
variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization
(GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling
mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction.
Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with
less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating
strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地捕捉监测点之间的空间关系，大幅提升空气质量预测结果的准确性和预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Accurate air quality prediction is becoming increasingly important in the
environmental field. To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow
real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results,
we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method
(Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior.
The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set
comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network
to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex
air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between
different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning
module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven
manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing
the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an
auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of
temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the
optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of
prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark
dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model
outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and
long-term predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在时间或频率域无法有效分离频谱数据中可预测模式与噪声，影响动态频谱访问与资源分配的效率。

Method: 采用自适应分数傅立叶变换将频谱数据转化到分数傅立叶域，在此基础上使用滤波模块压制噪声并保留关键特征，最后利用复杂值神经网络预测趋势。

Result: 实验证明SFFP能显著优于现有频谱预测方法及通用预测方法。

Conclusion: SFFP框架有效提升了频谱预测精度，为动态频谱访问和资源分配提供了更好的技术支持。

Abstract: Accurate spectrum prediction is crucial for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and
resource allocation. However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum
data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to
separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the
Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first
employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform
spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the
separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter
module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive
features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a
complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend
components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP
outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.

Method: 在LoRA的$B$矩阵优化中引入Stiefel流形优化，增加显式正交性约束，实现接近完美的正交性和全面的有效秩。

Result: 通过基准测试显示，使用Stiefel优化器相比AdamW优化器在LoRA和DoRA方法上的表现更优。

Conclusion: 几何约束是释放LoRA在大模型微调中全部潜能的关键。

Abstract: While powerful, large language models (LLMs) present significant fine-tuning
challenges due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods
like LoRA provide solutions, yet suffer from critical optimizer inefficiencies;
notably basis redundancy in LoRA's $B$ matrix when using AdamW, which
fundamentally limits performance. We address this by optimizing the $B$ matrix
on the Stiefel manifold, imposing explicit orthogonality constraints that
achieve near-perfect orthogonality and full effective rank. This geometric
approach dramatically enhances parameter efficiency and representational
capacity. Our Stiefel optimizer consistently outperforms AdamW across
benchmarks with both LoRA and DoRA, demonstrating that geometric constraints
are the key to unlocking LoRA's full potential for effective LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.

Conclusion: FedMate有效解决了联邦学习中异质性问题，平衡了模型的泛化能力与适应能力，具备良好的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Cross-client data heterogeneity in federated learning induces biases that
impede unbiased consensus condensation and the complementary fusion of
generalization- and personalization-oriented knowledge. While existing
approaches mitigate heterogeneity through model decoupling and representation
center loss, they often rely on static and restricted metrics to evaluate local
knowledge and adopt global alignment too rigidly, leading to consensus
distortion and diminished model adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose FedMate, a method that implements bilateral optimization: On the server
side, we construct a dynamic global prototype, with aggregation weights
calibrated by holistic integration of sample size, current parameters, and
future prediction; a category-wise classifier is then fine-tuned using this
prototype to preserve global consistency. On the client side, we introduce
complementary classification fusion to enable merit-based discrimination
training and incorporate cost-aware feature transmission to balance model
performance and communication efficiency. Experiments on five datasets of
varying complexity demonstrate that FedMate outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in harmonizing generalization and adaptation. Additionally, semantic
segmentation experiments on autonomous driving datasets validate the method's
real-world scalability.

Conclusion: 本文提出的生成特征插补框架有效提高了语义通信在传输误差条件下的鲁棒性和通信效率，为6G网络中的语义通信提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving unprecedented communication efficiency in sixth-generation (6G)
networks by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to extract and transmit the
underlying meanings of source data. However, deploying SemCom over digital
systems presents new challenges, particularly in ensuring robustness against
transmission errors that may distort semantically critical content. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed generative feature
imputing, which comprises three key techniques. First, we introduce a spatial
error concentration packetization strategy that spatially concentrates feature
distortions by encoding feature elements based on their channel mappings, a
property crucial for both the effectiveness and reduced complexity of the
subsequent techniques. Second, building on this strategy, we propose a
generative feature imputing method that utilizes a diffusion model to
efficiently reconstruct missing features caused by packet losses. Finally, we
develop a semantic-aware power allocation scheme that enables unequal error
protection by allocating transmission power according to the semantic
importance of each packet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional approaches, such as Deep Joint
Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) and JPEG2000, under block fading conditions,
achieving higher semantic accuracy and lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS) scores.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural scheme for the topology-aware interpolation of
time-varying scalar fields. Given a time-varying sequence of persistence
diagrams, along with a sparse temporal sampling of the corresponding scalar
fields, denoted as keyframes, our interpolation approach aims at "inverting"
the non-keyframe diagrams to produce plausible estimations of the
corresponding, missing data. For this, we rely on a neural architecture which
learns the relation from a time value to the corresponding scalar field, based
on the keyframe examples, and reliably extends this relation to the
non-keyframe time steps. We show how augmenting this architecture with specific
topological losses exploiting the input diagrams both improves the geometrical
and topological reconstruction of the non-keyframe time steps. At query time,
given an input time value for which an interpolation is desired, our approach
instantaneously produces an output, via a single propagation of the time input
through the network. Experiments interpolating 2D and 3D time-varying datasets
show our approach superiority, both in terms of data and topological fitting,
with regard to reference interpolation schemes.

Abstract: In this PhD thesis, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty
quantification in machine learning, which is based on proper scores.
Uncertainty quantification is an important cornerstone for trustworthy and
reliable machine learning applications in practice. Usually, approaches to
uncertainty quantification are problem-specific, and solutions and insights
cannot be readily transferred from one task to another. Proper scores are loss
functions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very
general definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even
generative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that
connect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration
with proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We
achieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly
proper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the
kernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based
generative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language
generation. This includes a novel approach for uncertainty estimation of large
language models, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we
generalize the calibration-sharpness decomposition beyond classification, which
motivates the definition of proper calibration errors. We then introduce a
novel estimator for proper calibration errors in classification, and a novel
risk-based approach to compare different estimators for squared calibration
errors. Last, we offer a decomposition of the kernel spherical score, another
kernel-based proper score, allowing a more fine-grained and interpretable
evaluation of generative image models.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown substantial success in various
applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This study aims to
identify and isolate the components of two different adversarial training
techniques that contribute most to increased adversarial robustness,
particularly through the lens of margins in the input space -- the minimal
distance between data points and decision boundaries. Specifically, we compare
two methods that maximize margins: a simple approach which modifies the loss
function to increase an approximation of the margin, and a more complex
state-of-the-art method (Dynamics-Aware Robust Training) which builds upon this
approach. Using a VGG-16 model as our base, we systematically isolate and
evaluate individual components from these methods to determine their relative
impact on adversarial robustness. We assess the effect of each component on the
model's performance under various adversarial attacks, including AutoAttack and
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Our analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveals
which elements most effectively enhance adversarial robustness, providing
insights for designing more robust DNNs.

Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on
real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard
avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained
computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant
challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater
Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for
real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments
of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized
Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture
significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time
onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high
accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive
Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and
reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach
enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with
Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient
detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a
computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater
detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous
planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.

Conclusion: 结合公开数据的信息可以显著增强差分隐私方法的性能，新方法为线性回归提供了更好的隐私与实用性权衡。

Abstract: Leveraging information from public data has become increasingly crucial in
enhancing the utility of differentially private (DP) methods. Traditional DP
approaches often require adding noise based solely on private data, which can
significantly degrade utility. In this paper, we address this limitation in the
context of the ordinary least squares estimator (OLSE) of linear regression
based on sufficient statistics perturbation (SSP) under the unbounded data
assumption. We propose a novel method that involves transforming private data
using the public second-moment matrix to compute a transformed SSP-OLSE, whose
second-moment matrix yields a better condition number and improves the OLSE
accuracy and robustness. We derive theoretical error bounds about our method
and the standard SSP-OLSE to the non-DP OLSE, which reveal the improved
robustness and accuracy achieved by our approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Non-parametric change-point detection in streaming time series data is a
long-standing challenge in signal processing. Recent advancements in statistics
and machine learning have increasingly addressed this problem for data residing
on Riemannian manifolds. One prominent strategy involves monitoring abrupt
changes in the center of mass of the time series. Implemented in a streaming
fashion, this strategy, however, requires careful step size tuning when
computing the updates of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose to
leverage robust centroid on manifolds from M-estimation theory to address this
issue. Our proposal consists of comparing two centroid estimates: the classical
Karcher mean (sensitive to change) versus one defined from Huber's function
(robust to change). This comparison leads to the definition of a test statistic
whose performance is less sensitive to the underlying estimation method. We
propose a stochastic Riemannian optimization algorithm to estimate both robust
centroids efficiently. Experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world
data across two representative manifolds demonstrate the superior performance
of our proposed method.

Motivation: 传统的基于消息传递的GNN方法在模拟物理现象时存在扩展性和效率的局限性，尤其是在处理大型复杂网格时。

Method: 提出利用邻接矩阵作为注意力掩码的Graph Transformer架构，同时引入创新的扩展感受野方法，如Dilated Sliding Windows和Global Attention，为模型在保持计算效率的同时提高表现能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的Graph Transformer模型不仅在效率和性能上优于现有方法，同时具备很好的扩展性，为大型物理模拟问题提供了一种高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulating physics using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is predominantly driven
by message-passing architectures, which face challenges in scaling and
efficiency, particularly in handling large, complex meshes. These architectures
have inspired numerous enhancements, including multigrid approaches and $K$-hop
aggregation (using neighbours of distance $K$), yet they often introduce
significant complexity and suffer from limited in-depth investigations. In
response to these challenges, we propose a novel Graph Transformer architecture
that leverages the adjacency matrix as an attention mask. The proposed approach
incorporates innovative augmentations, including Dilated Sliding Windows and
Global Attention, to extend receptive fields without sacrificing computational
efficiency. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate model size,
adjacency matrix augmentations, positional encoding and $K$-hop configurations
using challenging 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) datasets. We also train
over 60 models to find a scaling law between training FLOPs and parameters. The
introduced models demonstrate remarkable scalability, performing on meshes with
up to 300k nodes and 3 million edges. Notably, the smallest model achieves
parity with MeshGraphNet while being $7\times$ faster and $6\times$ smaller.
The largest model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by $38.8$\% on
average and outperforms MeshGraphNet by $52$\% on the all-rollout RMSE, while
having a similar training speed. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的连续时间动态图神经网络（CGNNs），解决了传统GNN应用在异步演化和非连通图时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络方法主要针对离散动态图，但无法有效处理真实系统中异步演化和非连通图的问题。

Method: 通过提出连续时间动态1-WL测试，并证明其等价于连续时间动态展开树，进而定义了一种连续时间动态GNN架构。设计重点在于结合分段连续可微的时间函数处理异步和非连通图。

Result: 新提出的CGNNs保留了传统GNN的区分能力和通用逼近性，提供一种紧凑且表现力强的模型用于异步、非连通图的处理。

Conclusion: 理论和构造证明了CGNNs是一种强大的工具，可以为实际应用中复杂动态图带来有效解决方案，并给出了实用的设计指南。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to match the distinguishing power of
the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test, and the resulting partitions coincide with
the unfolding tree equivalence classes of graphs. Preserving this equivalence,
GNNs can universally approximate any target function on graphs in probability
up to any precision. However, these results are limited to attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs represented as sequences of connected graph snapshots.
Real-world systems, such as communication networks, financial transaction
networks, and molecular interactions, evolve asynchronously and may split into
disconnected components. In this paper, we extend the theory of attributed
discrete-dynamic graphs to attributed continuous-time dynamic graphs with
arbitrary connectivity. To this end, we introduce a continuous-time dynamic
1-WL test, prove its equivalence to continuous-time dynamic unfolding trees,
and identify a class of continuous-time dynamic GNNs (CGNNs) based on
discrete-dynamic GNN architectures that retain both distinguishing power and
universal approximation guarantees. Our constructive proofs further yield
practical design guidelines, emphasizing a compact and expressive CGNN
architecture with piece-wise continuously differentiable temporal functions to
process asynchronous, disconnected graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FedGreed，一种针对联邦学习中拜占庭攻击的鲁棒聚合策略。实验表明，FedGreed在大多数对抗性场景下优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习面临拜占庭攻击的威胁，尤其是在数据分布不均（非IID）的情况下。作者希望解决这些挑战，并设计出一种同时具备鲁棒性和可靠性的模型聚合方法。

Method: FedGreed通过评估每个客户端的局部模型更新在服务器可信数据集上的损失指标排序，并贪婪地选择损失最小的客户端子集来更新全球模型。该方法无需假设恶意参与者的比例，并适用于非IID数据分布。

Result: FedGreed的收敛性和最优性在强对抗行为下得到保证。实验显示，在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10上的大多数对抗性场景（如标签翻转和高斯噪声注入）中，FedGreed显著优于Mean、Trimmed Mean、Median、Krum、Multi-Krum等基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGreed提供了一种鲁棒且可靠的联邦学习解决方案，在存在强对抗性威胁和非IID数据分布的场景下表现出色，能够进一步促进联邦学习在现实世界中的部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy by keeping local datasets on-device. In
this work, we address FL settings where clients may behave adversarially,
exhibiting Byzantine attacks, while the central server is trusted and equipped
with a reference dataset. We propose FedGreed, a resilient aggregation strategy
for federated learning that does not require any assumptions about the fraction
of adversarial participants. FedGreed orders clients' local model updates based
on their loss metrics evaluated against a trusted dataset on the server and
greedily selects a subset of clients whose models exhibit the minimal
evaluation loss. Unlike many existing approaches, our method is designed to
operate reliably under heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions, which are
prevalent in real-world deployments. FedGreed exhibits convergence guarantees
and bounded optimality gaps under strong adversarial behavior. Experimental
evaluations on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms standard and robust federated learning baselines,
such as Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum, in the majority of
adversarial scenarios considered, including label flipping and Gaussian noise
injection attacks. All experiments were conducted using the Flower federated
learning framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GNSS欺骗检测方法对新型、演化和未知攻击检测能力不足的问题。

Method: 利用混合量子-经典自动编码器(HQC-AE)，仅对真实GNSS信号进行训练，并通过跟踪阶段提取的特征实现检测。

Result: 在不同复杂程度的时间推送欺骗攻击情境下，HQC-AE方法超过传统监督学习与现有无监督学习方法，平均检测精度为97.71%，复杂攻击情况下达到98.23%。

Conclusion: HQC-AE方法在检测静态GNSS接收器上的零日时间推送欺骗攻击中表现卓越，具有广泛的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are critical for Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) applications. However, GNSS are highly vulnerable
to spoofing attacks, where adversaries transmit counterfeit signals to mislead
receivers. Such attacks can lead to severe consequences, including misdirected
navigation, compromised data integrity, and operational disruptions. Most
existing spoofing detection methods depend on supervised learning techniques
and struggle to detect novel, evolved, and unseen attacks. To overcome this
limitation, we develop a zero-day spoofing detection method using a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Autoencoder (HQC-AE), trained solely on authentic GNSS
signals without exposure to spoofed data. By leveraging features extracted
during the tracking stage, our method enables proactive detection before PNT
solutions are computed. We focus on spoofing detection in static GNSS
receivers, which are particularly susceptible to time-push spoofing attacks,
where attackers manipulate timing information to induce incorrect time
computations at the receiver. We evaluate our model against different unseen
time-push spoofing attack scenarios: simplistic, intermediate, and
sophisticated. Our analysis demonstrates that the HQC-AE consistently
outperforms its classical counterpart, traditional supervised learning-based
models, and existing unsupervised learning-based methods in detecting zero-day,
unseen GNSS time-push spoofing attacks, achieving an average detection accuracy
of 97.71% with an average false negative rate of 0.62% (when an attack occurs
but is not detected). For sophisticated spoofing attacks, the HQC-AE attains an
accuracy of 98.23% with a false negative rate of 1.85%. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our method in proactively detecting zero-day
GNSS time-push spoofing attacks across various stationary GNSS receiver
platforms.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决噪声未知且复杂的贝叶斯反问题提供了一种新的高效方法，通过整合流匹配和EM框架实现了高维推断的可行性和准确性。

Abstract: We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列预测在实践中非常重要，但Transformer的高计算成本和弱时间偏差使其表现不足，要求设计一种高效且性能优越的替代方法。

Method: FreezeTST通过引入固定的随机特征块（储层）与可训练的Transformer层交替结构；这些特征块无需优化，提供丰富的非线性记忆，而Transformer层通过自注意力机制查询这些记忆。

Result: 在七个标准长程预测基准上，FreezeTST始终匹配或超过现有的专用模型如Informer、Autoformer和PatchTST，且具有显著更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 将储层原理嵌入Transformer提供了一个简单且有理论支持的方式，实现了高效的长序列时间预测。

Abstract: Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.

Abstract: The ``black-box'' nature of deep learning models presents a significant
barrier to their adoption for scientific discovery, where interpretability is
paramount. This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing
equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their
topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper
provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic
regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including
sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation
of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their
inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical
systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can
successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly
surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this
performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable
activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics.
This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs
between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability
of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex
systems.

Conclusion: Prose展示了深度学习在设计高效和可迁移采样器方面的潜力，并开源了模型以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的三阶段方法，结合了多实例训练（MIT）、自适应批次DiLoCo以及切换模式机制，以提高大型语言模型分布式训练的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法（如DiLoCo）在动态负载下难以充分利用计算资源，导致训练效率下降。作者希望开发一种方法来优化资源利用并提高训练收敛速度。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1. 多实例训练（MIT），通过并行运行多个轻量训练流以提高吞吐量和减少空闲时间。2. 自适应批次DiLoCo，动态调整本地批次大小以平衡计算和通信，减少同步延迟。3. 切换模式，当批次大小超出硬件友好范围时，引入梯度累积稳定训练。

Result: 该方法显著提升了训练的收敛速度和系统效率，同时提供了对全收敛所需通信轮数的理论估计。

Conclusion: 三阶段方法在动态环境下有效优化了硬件资源利用，为大型语言模型的分布式训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires not
only algorithmic advances but also efficient utilization of heterogeneous
hardware resources. While existing methods such as DiLoCo have demonstrated
promising results, they often fail to fully exploit computational clusters
under dynamic workloads. To address this limitation, we propose a three-stage
method that combines Multi-Instance Training (MIT), Adaptive Batched DiLoCo,
and switch mode mechanism. MIT allows individual nodes to run multiple
lightweight training streams with different model instances in parallel and
merge them to combine knowledge, increasing throughput and reducing idle time.
Adaptive Batched DiLoCo dynamically adjusts local batch sizes to balance
computation and communication, substantially lowering synchronization delays.
Switch mode further stabilizes training by seamlessly introducing gradient
accumulation once adaptive batch sizes grow beyond hardware-friendly limits.
Together, these innovations improve both convergence speed and system
efficiency. We also provide a theoretical estimate of the number of
communications required for the full convergence of a model trained using our
method.

*Pradeep Singh,Sutirtha Ghosh,Ashutosh Kumar,Hrishit B P,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 介绍了一种名为Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER)的新型ESN方法，通过在Poincare球中嵌入神经元以改进混沌动力学的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ESN在预测混沌动力学时受限于欧几里得几何，这与混沌系统的拉伸-折叠结构不匹配，因此需要新方法改进预测精度。

Method: 在Poincare球中以负曲率嵌入神经元，调整其连接以与混沌系统的Lyapunov方向对齐，并结合稀疏性、泄漏积分和谱半径控制等标准ESN特性，仅使用Tikhonov正则化读取层进行训练。

Result: 在Lorenz-63、Roessler系统及Chen-Ueta吸引子上实验显示，HypER显著提升了预测时间，并在心率变化和国际黑子数等实际数据集上同样显示出优势。

Conclusion: HypER方法通过负曲率嵌入和几何对齐成功延长预测时间，并在混沌动力系统预测中表现优于现有基线。

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic dynamics beyond a few Lyapunov times is difficult because
infinitesimal errors grow exponentially. Existing Echo State Networks (ESNs)
mitigate this growth but employ reservoirs whose Euclidean geometry is
mismatched to the stretch-and-fold structure of chaos. We introduce the
Hyperbolic Embedding Reservoir (HypER), an ESN whose neurons are sampled in the
Poincare ball and whose connections decay exponentially with hyperbolic
distance. This negative-curvature construction embeds an exponential metric
directly into the latent space, aligning the reservoir's local
expansion-contraction spectrum with the system's Lyapunov directions while
preserving standard ESN features such as sparsity, leaky integration, and
spectral-radius control. Training is limited to a Tikhonov-regularized readout.
On the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Roessler systems, and the hyperchaotic Chen-Ueta
attractor, HypER consistently lengthens the mean valid-prediction horizon
beyond Euclidean and graph-structured ESN baselines, with statistically
significant gains confirmed over 30 independent runs; parallel results on
real-world benchmarks, including heart-rate variability from the Santa Fe and
MIT-BIH datasets and international sunspot numbers, corroborate its advantage.
We further establish a lower bound on the rate of state divergence for HypER,
mirroring Lyapunov growth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度学习和矩阵补全的方法，用于在物联网定位中恢复被异常值污染的欧几里得距离矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有定位技术在异常值情况下的表现欠佳，研究和提出一种鲁棒性更强的解决方案。

Method: 将距离矩阵表示为传感器坐标矩阵的函数，同时利用深度神经网络联合恢复距离矩阵和坐标。为了处理异常值，将其建模为稀疏矩阵并添加正则化项，通过交替优化求解问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，即使存在异常值，提出的方法仍能准确恢复传感器位置。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够在异常值干扰下有效地恢复定位信息，为物联网网络定位提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning and matrix completion aided
approach for recovering an outlier contaminated Euclidean distance matrix D in
IoT network localization. Unlike conventional localization techniques that
search the solution over a whole set of matrices, the proposed technique
restricts the search to the set of Euclidean distance matrices. Specifically,
we express D as a function of the sensor coordinate matrix X that inherently
satisfies the unique properties of D, and then jointly recover D and X using a
deep neural network. To handle outliers effectively, we model them as a sparse
matrix L and add a regularization term of L into the optimization problem. We
then solve the problem by alternately updating X, D, and L. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique can recover the location
information of sensors accurately even in the presence of outliers.

*Chu-Cheng Lin,Daiyi Peng,Yifeng Lu,Ming Zhang,Eugene Ie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs)，用于优化复杂多步骤工作流的语言模型组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前离散提示优化在多步骤工作流中的脆弱性以及缺乏结构化任务合规性的挑战。

Method: 通过把工作流适应性问题重新表述为学习带类型的概率程序，结合梯度训练技术和设计优化目标，使得语言模型可以进行类型合规的学习和适应。

Result: 实验表明，TACs显著优于当前的提示优化基线，特别是在结构化任务上表现突出（例如在MGSM任务上的提升达到数十个百分点）。

Conclusion: TACs为开发可靠且任务合规的大语言模型系统提供了一种健全且理论支持的方法论。

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step
workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm-optimizing
discrete prompts in a pipeline-is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce
the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce
Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow
adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treats the entire
workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and
deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables
principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures.
We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective,
proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type
compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured
tasks, improving MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a 27B model, MGSM
from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$ for a 7B model. TACs offers a robust and theoretically
grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据驱动的方法，通过学习与下游任务评价对齐的代理评价函数，改善预测评估与实际下游影响之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改善预测质量评估与实际下游应用场景之间的不一致性，当前方法依赖于多种任务特定指标或需要预先明确的成本结构，存在一定局限性。

Method: 提出了一种基于加权评分规则的数据驱动方法，使用神经网络参数化的加权评分规则进行学习，使评价函数与下游任务表现对齐，确保快速且可扩展的跨任务评估。

Result: 在合成数据和实际回归任务中展示了该框架的有效性，能够弥合预测评估与下游实用性之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对评分规则的转化和学习过程，展示了改进模块化预测系统中预测评价对下游影响对齐的潜力。

Abstract: Every prediction is ultimately used in a downstream task. Consequently,
evaluating prediction quality is more meaningful when considered in the context
of its downstream use. Metrics based solely on predictive performance often
diverge from measures of real-world downstream impact. Existing approaches
incorporate the downstream view by relying on multiple task-specific metrics,
which can be burdensome to analyze, or by formulating cost-sensitive
evaluations that require an explicit cost structure, typically assumed to be
known a priori. We frame this mismatch as an evaluation alignment problem and
propose a data-driven method to learn a proxy evaluation function aligned with
the downstream evaluation. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, we
explore transformations of scoring rules that ensure the preservation of
propriety. Our approach leverages weighted scoring rules parametrized by a
neural network, where weighting is learned to align with the performance in the
downstream task. This enables fast and scalable evaluation cycles across tasks
where the weighting is complex or unknown a priori. We showcase our framework
through synthetic and real-data experiments for regression tasks, demonstrating
its potential to bridge the gap between predictive evaluation and downstream
utility in modular prediction systems.

TL;DR: 引入了新优化器Ano及其变体Anolog，为改良优化方法在噪声和非平稳环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如Adam、Adan在面对非平稳或噪声环境时表现不佳，需改进其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Ano优化器，采用方向与梯度大小解耦设计；Anolog进一步通过对动量系数使用对数时间表扩展窗口解决灵敏度问题。

Result: 提供理论收敛保证，类似于其他基于符号的方法，并在多种任务上展示了优异的性能，尤其是在有噪声和非平稳环境中的任务如强化学习，同时在低噪声任务如计算机视觉基准测试中也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Ano和Anolog优化器在多个应用场景中展现出优异性能，并具有理论支持，是当前优化方法的改进与补充。

Abstract: Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods
such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments,
partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We
introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude:
momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient
magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient
noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We
further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient
by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish
non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other
sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in
noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while
remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision
benchmarks.

Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving
widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs
(MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store
non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1)
mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs,
and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this
paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs
through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We
first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without
incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain
problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising
solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this
limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running
time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied
to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants.
We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large
population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can
generally hold in practice by experiments on four well-known practical
optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and
NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.

Abstract: Arc-routing problems underpin numerous critical field operations, including
power-line inspection, urban police patrolling, and traffic monitoring. In this
domain, the Rural Postman Problem (RPP) is a fundamental variant in which a
prescribed subset of edges or arcs in a network must be traversed. This paper
investigates a generalized form of the RPP, called RPP-mTD, which involves a
fleet of multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones. The trucks act as
mobile depots traversing a road network, from which drones are launched to
execute simultaneous service, with the objective of minimizing the overall
makespan. Given the combinatorial complexity of RPP-mTD, we propose a Hybrid
Genetic Algorithm (HGA) that combines population-based exploration with
targeted neighborhood searches. Solutions are encoded using a two-layer
chromosome that represents: (i) an ordered, directed sequence of required
edges, and (ii) their assignment to vehicles. A tailored segment-preserving
crossover operator is introduced, along with multiple local search techniques
to intensify the optimization. We benchmark the proposed HGA against
established single truck-and-drone instances, demonstrating competitive
performance. Additionally, we conduct extensive evaluations on new,
larger-scale instances to demonstrate scalability. Our findings highlight the
operational benefits of closely integrated truck-drone fleets, affirming the
HGA's practical effectiveness as a decision-support tool in advanced
mixed-fleet logistics.
