*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Héctor Cerezo-Costas,Dimosthenis Karatzas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出EaGERS，一个无需训练且模型无关的管线，用于生成、定位和筛选视觉语言模型的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在DocVQA任务中提升准确性、透明性和可重复性的问题，同时避免额外的模型微调。

Method: EaGERS通过三个步骤实现目标：(1) 用视觉语言模型生成自然语言推理，(2) 使用多模态嵌入相似性和多数投票将推理定位于空间子区域，(3) 仅从掩码图像中选定的相关区域生成响应。

Result: 在DocVQA数据集上的实验中，EaGERS最佳配置优于基础模型，在精确匹配准确性和平均归一化Levenshtein相似性指标上都有提升。

Conclusion: EaGERS不仅提高了DocVQA任务的性能，还增强了实验过程的透明性和可重复性，无需额外的模型微调。

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that
(1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2)
grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal
embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3)
restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected
in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our
best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy
and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances
transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model
fine-tuning.

### [2] [MindJourney: Test-Time Scaling with World Models for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12508)
*Yuncong Yang,Jiageng Liu,Zheyuan Zhang,Siyuan Zhou,Reuben Tan,Jianwei Yang,Yilun Du,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为MindJourney的框架，通过结合可控世界模型，使视觉-语言模型（VLMs）具备3D推理能力，从而提高其在空间推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言模型在处理3D空间的推理任务中存在较大的局限性，尤其是在基于自我中心运动预测场景的视觉变化方面。作者希望通过引入3D动态建模能力提升模型在这些任务中的表现。

Method: MindJourney框架结合了VLMs和基于视频扩散的可控世界模型。VLMs迭代生成相机轨迹，世界模型生成对应的视图，然后依赖这些多视角证据完成推理任务，无需对原有模型进行微调。

Result: 在空间推理基准测试SAT中，MindJourney框架表现出平均8%以上的性能提升。同时，其表现优于通过强化学习训练的测试时推理VLMs。

Conclusion: 将VLMs与世界模型结合用于测试时扩展的方法无须调整现有模型即可显著提升其3D推理能力，为增强空间推理任务提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出单一结构的多模态大模型Mono-InternVL及其改进版Mono-InternVL-1.5，通过全新的视觉参数嵌入与创新的预训练方法，解决了现有模型优化不稳定和遗忘问题，并在多个基准测试中表现突出。

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究综述了大规模像素级作物制图工作流，比较了多种传统监督方法和传输学习方法，并在五个农业地点进行了评估，揭示了三大关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进高效、精确的作物制图，以支持农业管理和决策，借助卫星遥感数据探索优化方法。

Method: 对六种预处理方法和十一种像素级分类模型进行系统评估，分析训练样本大小和变量组合对结果的影响，并研究不同领域转移学习技术的适用性。

Result: 1. 细尺度间隔预处理和Transformer模型表现最好；2. 不同转移学习技术具有适应性，适视具体场景；3. 标签样本的多少显著影响方法选择。

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical
imaging.

### [6] [MS-DGCNN++: A Multi-Scale Fusion Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Biological Knowledge Integration for LiDAR Tree Species Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12602)
*Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Hanaa El Afia,Raddouane Chiheb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MS-DGCNN++的新型神经网络，旨在改进利用地面LiDAR点云进行树种分类的精度，该方法在多个数据集上实现了领先的性能，同时具备较低的参数和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MS-DGCNN方法在处理多尺度特征时采用平行方式，但未能有效捕捉树木架构层级间的语义关系，因此需要一种更具语义特性的分层特征提取方法。

Method: 提出了一种分层多尺度融合动态图卷积网络（MS-DGCNN++），通过局部、分枝和冠层三个层级的语义特征提取以及跨尺度的信息传播，利用各层级特定的特征工程来增强分类性能。

Result: 在STPCTLS数据集上实现94.96%的准确率，相比现有方法均有显著提升；在FOR-species20K数据集上达67.25%（提高6.1%）；在3D物体识别任务中也表现突出。同时该方法参数和复杂度低于当前主流变换器模型。

Conclusion: MS-DGCNN++不仅能有效解决树种分类问题，其方法还可扩展到标准3D物体识别，体现了该方法在点云处理领域的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: Action anticipation has become a prominent topic in Human Action Recognition
(HAR). However, its application to real-world sports scenarios remains limited
by the availability of suitable annotated datasets. This work presents a novel
dataset of manually annotated soccer penalty kicks to predict shot direction
based on pre-kick player movements. We propose a deep learning classifier to
benchmark this dataset that integrates HAR-based feature embeddings with
contextual metadata. We evaluate twenty-two backbone models across seven
architecture families (MViTv2, MViTv1, SlowFast, Slow, X3D, I3D, C2D),
achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the
dataset's value for anticipatory action recognition and validate our model's
potential as a generalizable approach for sports-based predictive tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HOID中的标注数据有限和长尾分布问题，以及现有方法仅注重解码器设计的问题。

Method: 提出Funnel-HOI框架，以自上而下的方式首先检测物体（具体概念），再检测与其关联的动作（抽象概念），并通过一种新颖的非对称共同注意机制和改进的损失函数增强交互表征能力。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集的全监督和六类零样本设置下，Funnel-HOI方法在未见和稀有HOI类别上分别取得了12.4%和8.4%的性能提升，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 加强编码器阶段的HOI特定信息挖掘对提高交互检测性能具有重要作用，提出的方法成功实现了对未见和稀有类别的优异识别效果。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

*Kaihua Chen,Tarasha Khurana,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种基于单目视频的动态场景新视角合成方法，主要利用3D重建和视频扩散模型进行像素渲染和补全，实验表明性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有方法对4D表示昂贵的测试优化依赖或在端到端训练时无法保持场景几何的问题。

Method: 通过结合动态3D场景重建与2D视频扩散模型进行渲染和补全，其中扩散模型从单目视频中无监督学习，并支持零样本迁移和测试时微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的CogNVS方法在动态场景的新视角合成任务中表现优于几乎所有已有方法。

Conclusion: CogNVS方法在动态场景的新视角合成中展现了卓越的性能，尤其是其无需监督、自我驱动的训练方式与优良的泛化能力。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合视网膜微血管特征和血清脂质组数据，该研究提出了一种创新的成像组学框架来发现CVD早期的无症状生物标志物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病(CVD)是全球主要死亡原因，但现有风险分层方法无法有效检测早期无症状变化。本研究旨在弥补这一不足，通过结合视网膜微血管特征与血清脂质组数据，寻找潜在的CVD风险指标。

Method: 利用深度学习图像处理技术量化视网膜表型，同时通过超高效液相色谱-电喷雾离子化高分辨质谱 (UHPLC-ESI-HRMS) 进行血清脂质分析。随后进行针对健康人群的协变量调整和分层相关性分析。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了代谢压力下的微血管重塑机制，为CVD早期病理学提供了新的视角，并提出了一种潜在的无创生物标志物鉴定方法，有助于实现早期监测、预防和个性化治疗。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Conclusion: NeuraLeaf成功解决了植物叶子建模的挑战，并提供了开源实现和数据集，有助于农业和计算机图形领域的发展。

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at
https://neuraleaf-yang.github.io/.

provide higher-resolution feature maps for better small object detection, and
employs Soft-NMS to refine confidence scores and retain true positives.
Experimental results demonstrate that SOD-YOLO significantly improves detection
performance, achieving a 36.1% increase in mAP$_{50:95}$ and 20.6% increase in
mAP$_{50}$ on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset compared to the baseline model.
These enhancements make SOD-YOLO a practical and efficient solution for small
object detection in UAV imagery. Our source code, hyper-parameters, and model

targeted prompt engineering strategies to produce actionable feedback and
standardized accident archives. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对UMIS面临的多尺度结构异质性问题，传统方法在缺乏解剖学见解和器官关系建模上存在局限。

Method: 提出Mamba Snake，一种通过状态空间建模强化的深度蛇框架，包含Mamba Evolution Block模块，以及结合能量图形状先验和双分类协同机制。

Result: 实验在五个临床数据集上展示了优异表现，Dice分数平均提高3%。

Conclusion: Mamba Snake能有效处理复杂形态与异质数据，提升UMIS性能。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an autonomous UAV vision system for continuous,
real-time tracking of marine animals, specifically sharks, in dynamic marine
environments. The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D
camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification
under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key
innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer
of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage
beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated
shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9\%
during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion,
illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV
handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence
feature matching, achieving 82.9\% target coverage. These results confirm the
viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay
the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-行动（VLA）模型对任务专属演示依赖较高，存在泛化能力不足和数据获取成本高的问题。

Method: 提出任务无关动作范式，并设计了ATARA框架用于自动化数据采集；开发了AnyPos模型，包括Arm-Decoupled Estimation和Direction-Aware Decoder，结合视频验证模块提升学习效果。

Conclusion: 通过结合任务无关行动采集、有效的数据利用及验证模块，显著提升了复杂任务控制中的模型性能与训练效率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于注意力机制的图像生成模型中注意力操作复杂度高的问题。

Method: 引入局部窗口和代表性标记的合并策略，通过计算相似性选取窗口内代表性标记，既保证局部特征保留又减少计算开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReToM在图像生成质量（FID提高6.2%，CLIP分数更高）和推理时间之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: ReToM证实其在平衡视觉质量和计算效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: KCR-Transformer兼具理论支持和实践应用，有效提升了网络性能，并具备广泛兼容性和低计算复杂度的优势。

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Motivation: 通过室外场景理解使智能体更好地解读环境。然而，现有的视觉语言模型主要聚焦于室内任务，难以应对室外环境涉及的大规模、多视点、多模态感知的需求，同时也缺乏完整的室外多领域数据。

Method: 构建了首个面向室外场景理解的多域感知数据集SVM-City，包含420k图像、4811M点云和567k问答对。提出City-VLM模型，通过构建联合概率分布空间实现多模态数据融合，尤其是在部分模态缺失的情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个室外场景下表现出实用性和泛化能力，为室外大规模场景理解提供了新的思路和工具。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Result: 实验表明，DeQA-Doc在多种文档退化类型下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc实现了可靠的、通用的文档质量评估，可应用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

### [29] [FIQ: Fundamental Question Generation with the Integration of Question Embeddings for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12816)
*Ju-Young Oh,Ho-Joong Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的视频问答方法（FIQ），通过生成以场景基础细节为中心的问题和答案对增强模型的推理能力，并在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法主要利用事件为中心的问答对训练模型，缺乏对更广泛视频上下文的捕获，限制了模型的泛化能力和高层次推理能力。

Method: 提出FIQ，通过从视频提取描述生成包含基础场景信息的问答对，并引入VQ-CAlign模块来结合问题嵌入与视觉特征，提高模型对下游任务的适应性。

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上，FIQ相较于现有的基线方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FIQ通过更好地捕获视频基础信息并改善问答嵌入与视觉特征的结合，增强了模型的推理能力与适应性。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

*Jeong-Woo Park,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多功能的思维链重排（MCoT-RE），一种训练自由的CIR框架，显著提高了检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前CIR任务在使用零样本的方法时存在信息损失及跨模态交互受限等问题。本文旨在改进现有方法，通过整合视觉和文本信息提升模型能力。

Method: 提出了MCoT-RE框架，利用多功能思维链生成两个独特描述，一个专注于修改，另一个结合综合视觉-文本上下文信息，并通过两阶段方法实现更精准的图像检索。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上，MCoT-RE分别在Recall@10和Recall@1指标上实现了最高提升，增幅分别达6.24%和8.58%。

Conclusion: MCoT-RE框架无需额外训练便可显著提升CIR任务性能，展示了创新方法的有效性。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FAR-Net多阶段融合框架，提高图像与文本之间的精细语义对齐，实现了更优秀的CIR任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像-文本融合中存在的问题，如过度依赖文本细节或未能捕捉细粒度语义对齐关系。

Method: 提出FAR-Net框架，包括两大模块：增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）采用交叉注意力进行精细语义捕捉；自适应调和模块（ARM）利用不确定性嵌入增强稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上表现优异，Recall@1提升至2.4%，Recall@50提升至1.04%。

Conclusion: FAR-Net提供了对组合图像检索任务的稳健且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the
TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and
Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction
capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets
ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved
classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores
by 45\% and style scores by 12\%, and it also achieves substantial gains on
widely used benchmarks such as MIA-Bench and VidCapBench.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of
computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation
of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing,
image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex
satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to
present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image
captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion,
Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated.
We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image
datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates
potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

Motivation: 解决CLIP模型在域泛化任务中未能有效关注目标相关区域的问题，提升其在未见目标域上的性能表现。

Method: 提出Simulate, Refocus and Ensemble (SRE)方法，分别通过数据增强模拟域转移、通过注意力重聚减少域偏移，以及通过集成学习捕捉域不变的注意力图。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，与最先进的方法相比，SRE通常表现更好。

Conclusion: SRE方法通过模拟域转移、注意力重聚和集成学习，有效提升CLIP模型在域泛化任务中的表现。代码已开放以供参考。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Conclusion: SCORE框架能有效解决遥感中场景多样性和物体识别复杂性问题，为大规模实际地理空间分析提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Result: 通过充分的消融实验和多个基准数据集的实验，证明了HRSeg在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的模块设计解决了分辨率限制问题，为推理分割任务提供了出色的性能。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

Abstract: We present NeckSense, a novel wearable system for head pose tracking that
leverages multi-channel bio-impedance sensing with soft, dry electrodes
embedded in a lightweight, necklace-style form factor. NeckSense captures
dynamic changes in tissue impedance around the neck, which are modulated by
head rotations and subtle muscle activations. To robustly estimate head pose,
we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外显信号（如面部表情、语音等）或生理信号，但存在容易掩盖、复杂传感器要求或对环境背景不足等不足，难以捕捉深层情绪与行为的联系。

Method: 使用一般的高清摄像头，无需复杂硬件，通过捕捉视线轨迹和头部运动，整合空间、语义及时间动态，建模注视行为与环境间的互动。

Result: 验证了情绪源于人类与环境复杂交互的结果。方法具备实时性、低部署成本和高通用性。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了现有情绪识别方法局限，通过整合注视行为及环境维度，为实时、自然情绪识别提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道检测在高级驾驶辅助系统和自动驾驶系统中至关重要，但域迁移会影响模型的可靠性，且收集目标域数据成本高昂，需寻找无标签性能估计的有效方法。

Method: 该研究首先将五种来自图像分类的性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务作为基线，并进一步提出LanePerf框架，该框架整合了预训练图像编码器和基于DeepSets的架构，可应对无车道检测和大域迁移的场景。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上进行的大量实验表明，LanePerf相较基线方法表现优越，取得了0.117的MAE更低误差和0.727更高的Spearman秩相关系数。

Conclusion: LanePerf框架为ADAS中的车道检测性能估计提供了一种无需标签的高效方法，有助于提高测试效率及提升复杂驾驶场景中的安全性。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了用于联邦学习的第一个专门图像分类数据集，并开发了两种新的联邦学习算法（Fed-Cyclic 和 Fed-Star），实验表明算法在新数据集上的表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决联邦学习中数据隐私保护的需求，并填补专门用于联邦学习的数据集空白。

Method: 引入一个包含23,326张图像、分为31类的新数据集，并设计了两种新的联邦学习算法：Fed-Cyclic 和 Fed-Star。Fed-Cyclic 形成循环拓扑，用户在局部训练后将参数传递给下一个用户；Fed-Star 形成星型拓扑，通过预聚合缓解统计异构性问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的两种算法（Fed-Cyclic 和 Fed-Star）在新数据集上的性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的新数据集和新算法为联邦学习问题提供了新的解决方法，并显著改善了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种单目3D姿势估计方法，并引入了AthleticsPose数据集来改进运动分析中的姿势估计准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目3D姿势估计方法在体育分析中的应用受限于真实运动数据集的缺乏和对任务可靠性的不明确认识。

Method: 提出AthleticsPose数据集，包含23位运动员在运动场上执行不同田径动作的真实运动数据，并用该数据集训练和评估了一个3D姿态估计模型。

Result: 与基于模拟数据集训练的模型相比，基于AthleticsPose数据集训练的模型在MPJPE指标上降低了约75%，揭示了真实运动数据的重要性。此外，模型对拍摄视角和主体尺度较为敏感。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个宝贵的运动数据集，展示了单目3D姿势估计在运动分析中的潜力及局限性，并指出模型对高速指标（如膝驱动速度）的预测存在偏差。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

Motivation: 由于采用3D点云构建室内场景可能导致信息丢失，尤其是在处理纹理缺失平面或复杂结构的对象时，需要一种新方法来弥补这些不足。

Method: 提出Argus框架，通过结合文本指令、2D多视角图像、3D点云三种输入模态，融合多视图图像和相机位置信息，生成细致的3D场景表征，同时增强LLMs对3D任务的能力。

Result: 实验表明，Argus框架在多个3D任务中的表现优于现有3D-LMM方法。

Conclusion: Argus通过整合多模态数据，显著提升了LLMs在3D场景理解中的能力，有助于弥补3D点云重建中的信息丢失问题，并推动3D任务的进一步发展。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DMQ有效减少量化误差，同时保持图像生成质量和模型稳定性，为低资源环境部署提供可能性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding

classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的数据集上进行了实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 即使没有跨模态身份标注，提出的方法仍能有效提升跨模态身份识别的性能。

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MUPMs不仅优化和在不同任务中显示出高效应，而且在处理不同数据分布时展现了良好的适应性，为分析多模态医疗数据中的不确定性提供了一种创新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Result: 实验表明该方法在多任务中具有高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的文本到视频生成方法，可生成长且时序一致性的视频，同时兼容多种生成任务。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型图像变形配准框架需要多次训练迭代，调整正则参数的计算成本较高，模型普遍缺乏灵活性。

Method: cIDI基于隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过事先训练一个正则超参数的分布，使框架能快速基于分割掩码进行正则参数优化，同时DVF是连续且可微分的，支持自动微分技术的使用。

Result: 实验结果显示，cIDI在DIR-LAB数据集上表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDI能够高效地在不同正则化设置中运作，减少了重新训练的时间消耗，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait提供了一种创新框架，有效解决了单角色和多角色动画生成的挑战，推动了面部动画生成领域的发展。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于RGB-LDM的光谱重建方法，通过训练光谱不可观测特征自动编码器（SpeUAE）和RGB预训练的潜在扩散模型（RGB-LDM）的改造，提升了HIS重建的精度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光谱重建（SR）需要从RGB图像重建高光谱图像（HSIs），其中一个关键难题是估计不可观测特征。本研究的动机是通过RGB预训练模型中丰富的空间信息，学习光谱-空间的联合分布以完善不可观测特征的表达能力。

Method: 通过扩展RGB预训练的潜在扩散模型（RGB-LDM），提出了不可观测特征的潜在扩散模型（ULDM）。该方法包含两个阶段：训练光谱不可观测特征自动编码器（SpeUAE）进行光谱结构表示学习；结合空间自动编码器（SpaAE）进行光谱-空间联合分布学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在光谱重建和下游任务（如重光照任务）中均达到了目前的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 本文的两阶段方法通过分别表征光谱和空间信息，并利用RGB图像的引导，成功将RGB-LDM转化为用于光谱重建的ULDM，证明了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Conclusion: DISSect是一种在理论和实践中有效的样本选择方法，可显著提高对比学习的训练效率。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: 涂鸦标注是提升图像篡改定位效率与性能的有效手段，所提方法提出了先进的模块设计和训练策略，为未来弱监督学习提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Conclusion: HCS是一种可兼容各种VLM的即插即用方法，有效提高了VLM在复杂场景中的适应能力。

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Conclusion: 通过这项研究，证明检测器引导的数据集蒸馏框架可以有效提升合成数据的图像质量和标签一致性，为存储与计算资源受限的环境提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了实时性能并降低了计算开销，为安全关键型应用提供了更高效的运动分割解决方案。

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的开放世界目标检测模型Decoupled PROB，通过ETOP和TDQI技术显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有开放世界目标检测方法在处理对象性预测与分类预测冲突问题上的不足，提出改进方法。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB模型，引入了ETOP（早期停止对象性预测）和TDQI（任务解耦查询初始化）技术，同时TDQI可与现有的DETR-based OWOD模型轻松集成。

Result: 在多项OWOD基准上的测试结果表明，Decoupled PROB超过了目前所有现有方法，在多项指标上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过创新性模块设计有效解决了对象性与分类预测之间的冲突问题，在开放世界目标检测的性能上实现了全面的提升。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Method: 提出DiffOSeg，两阶段扩散框架：第一阶段通过概率共识策略建立群体共识，第二阶段通过自适应提示捕捉专家特定偏好。

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能够在医学图像分割中同时实现共识驱动与偏好驱动分割，为医学成像领域提供新的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Motivation: 尽管视觉基础模型在计算机视觉任务中表现强大，但由于特征粒度较粗，其在视觉里程计中的应用仍受限。本文旨在利用DINOv2的鲁棒特性，并集成其特性于单目视觉里程计中，从而提升系统表现。

Conclusion: DINO-VO凭借DINOv2的特性与改进的检测器、特征匹配及估计模块，成功提升了视觉里程计系统的鲁棒性、泛化性与效率。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: GLAD框架减少了提示调优中的过拟合问题，提供了更简单且通用的少样本学习解决方案。代码将公开。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: SE-VLN框架展现了作为自我进化视觉-语言导航框架的巨大潜力，能够随着经验库的增加持续提升性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动驾驶世界模型在长时间生成和复杂情景下泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 设计一个仅基于469M参数、280小时视频数据训练的简单模型，在无额外监督和传感器（如地图、深度、多个摄像头）的情况下实现。还设计了一个兼容连续和离散模型的混合标记器进行比较实验。

Result: 提出的连续自回归模型表现优于离散标记模型，尤其在转弯和城市交通等复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

*Zi Wang,Katsuya Hotta,Koichiro Kamide,Yawen Zou,Chao Zhang,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种基于配准的异常检测框架，通过多原型对齐和簇级差异分析实现精确的3D异常定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云数据在工业检测中虽能有效发现微小结构异常，但其密集和不规则性带来高计算成本、对空间错位敏感及难以捕捉局部差异等挑战。

Method: 框架的核心是将测试样例与多个正常原型对齐，并通过对点云进行聚类及在每个簇内计算测试样本与原型的特征相似度来评估局部异常。采用关键点引导的策略选择几何信息点作为簇中心，以实现更有意义和稳定的距离比较。

Result: 在Real3D-AD基准测试上，该方法在对象级和点级异常检测中达到了最前沿的性能，即便仅使用原始特征。

Conclusion: 实验表明，这种方法能显著提高3D异常检测的准确性和效率，特别适用于工业检测场景。

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

Result: 在真实建筑图像数据集评估中，模型在IoU阈值0.5和0.5到0.95时的平均精度（AP）分别达到0.937和0.642；在合成数据集上表现更优，AP分别达到0.994和0.919。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在解决DNN训练数据稀缺方面显示出潜力，但也存在局限性。

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at

Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared
blurry backgrounds and is essential for various applications. The detection
task is challenging due to the small size of the targets and their sparse
distribution in infrared small target datasets. Although existing IRSTD methods
and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的全局匹配架构 $S^2M^2$，在无需数据集特定微调的情况下实现了高效性和最先进的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的立体匹配方法在高分辨率及广视差范围的泛化能力上存在局限性，局部搜索方法虽然在有限条件下表现优异，但缺乏全局匹配的一致性；而全局匹配架构因计算和存储消耗过高难以实际应用。

Method: 设计了一种多分辨率Transformer以实现稳健的长距离匹配，通过新增的损失函数集中概率于可行的匹配点，提升了视差、遮挡及置信度的联合估计能力。

Result: $S^2M^2$ 在Middlebury v3 和 ETH3D 基准测试中均达到新的技术水平，大幅超越前人方法并以高效性重建高质量细节。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在高效性的同时保持先进精度的立体匹配模型，为全局匹配架构的实际应用提供了可能性。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

Method: 提出RS-TinyNet模型，包括微小物体显著性建模和特征完整性重建两大设计，采用多维协作注意力模块、辅助可逆分支和渐进融合检测头模块进行特征增强与信息整合。

Result: 在AI-TOD和DIOR数据集上验证，分别超越现有最优检测器4.0% AP和6.5% AP75，并展示出在多种遥感场景下的优异性能。

Conclusion: RS-TinyNet通过多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的微小物体检测提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

TL;DR: 提出了VITA，一种通过潜在视觉表示到潜在动作的流匹配方法，专注于改善视觉运动控制效率，减轻传统方法的时间和空间负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善视觉运动控制方法，消除传统方法中图像与动作之间复杂的条件模块，降低计算延迟。

Method: 提出一种流匹配方法，使用潜在图像作为流源，通过自编码器结构化动作潜在空间，并通过动作输出和编码器目标进行监督，实现在编码过程中端到端优化。基于简单的MLP模块构建。

Result: 在ALOHA平台上的5项模拟和2项现实任务中，MLP-only的VITA超越或媲美当前最先进的生成策略，并将推理延迟减少50-130%。

Conclusion: VITA方法在保持模型简洁性的同时，有效解决复杂双手操作任务，并显著提升效率，展现出应用潜力。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到预训练的权重矩阵具有行列向量间的近似正交性，而现有的低秩下/上投影矩阵缺乏此性质，进而可能限制模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT)，利用单个可学习向量生成近似正交的向量，作为下/上投影矩阵，使其与预训练主干参数的性质一致。

Result: 方法通过实验表明在多项图像分类任务中表现出竞争力，有助于验证其对模型泛化能力的提升。

Conclusion: AOFT策略能增强低秩矩阵在ViT细化中的泛化能力，证明了所提出策略的有效性。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效地检测生成视频，有望成为相关领域研究的重要工具，并将公开代码、模型和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiT计算成本高、无法在资源受限设备上实时运行的问题。

Method: 通过压缩VAE、三层剪枝策略、对抗蒸馏减少推理步骤等优化方案。

Result: 实现了iPhone 16 Pro Max上每秒超过10帧的视频生成速度。

Conclusion: 这些优化提升了DiT在移动设备上的实际应用性能，为资源受限环境中的实时视频生成提供了可能性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number
of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to
achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max,
demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on
mobile devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的新视角视频时空一致性较差，影响了视图合成的效果，需要改进生成质量。

Method: 通过定义一个编码图，并在空间和时间维度上通过滑动窗口进行迭代去噪，增强4D一致性，同时降低GPU内存消耗。

Result: 在DNA-Rendering和ActorsHQ数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成高质量、一致性强的新视角视频，比现有方法效果更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的滑动迭代去噪方法能够显著提升4D一致性生成视频的质量，是人类高保真视图合成领域的重要进展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

TL;DR: AutoPartGen是一种自回归模型，可基于图像、2D掩码或现有3D对象生成包含3D部件的对象。它依赖于3DShape2VecSet，逐步生成部件并自动确定数量和类型，最终以无缝方式组装对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种基于部分生成的创新性3D建模方法，旨在提高复杂对象的生成表现，并克服全局优化和手动调整的繁琐过程。

Method: 借助3DShape2VecSet的良好几何表达性，AutoPartGen通过自回归方式逐个预测和生成部件，利用条件信息直至模型决定生成完成，同时无需依赖进一步优化即可组装完整模型。

Result: 实验表明，AutoPartGen在整体3D生成能力及部分生成质量方面达到了当前最先进水平。

Conclusion: AutoPartGen为3D建模提供了一种高效和智能的部分生成框架，在生成质量和可用性上具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: 解决传统基于固定参考视图方法在参考点选择不佳时易导致的重建不稳定与失败问题。

Method: π³是一种完全置换等变的神经网络架构，能够预测仿射不变的摄像头位姿以及尺度不变的局部点图，而无需依赖任何参考坐标框架。

Conclusion: π³提供了一种简单、无偏差且性能先进的视觉几何重建技术，为实现更稳定的3D重建提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Result: 实验表明在合成数据及图像数据上，该方法能够有效提升层级流匹配的表现。

Conclusion: 小批量耦合方法为层级流匹配带来了动态调整复杂性的能力，这优化了模型的多模态速度分布建模效果。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

Motivation: 探讨人类如何在面临新情况时从广泛的背景知识中提取相关信息，并以连贯的方式进行推理。

Method: 设计了“模型合成架构”（MSA），利用语言模型实现全局相关检索和模型合成，利用概率程序生成连贯的定制化世界模型，并在新的推理数据集上评估其表现。

Result: MSA在新推理数据集上的表现优于仅使用语言模型的基线，能够更好地捕捉人类的判断。

Conclusion: MSA证明了其能在开放域中模拟人类的推理能力，为理解和复制人类的推理提供了一种可行的方法。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Motivation: 针对近年来对语言模型模态类别分类能力的质疑，研究探讨了如何通过模型解读技术更好地理解和提升其模态判断能力，并探索与人类模态分类的联系。

Method: 研究确定并分析了模型中能够区分模态类别的线性表示——模态差异向量，评估其表现并探讨其在更复杂模型中的涌现规律，同时通过人类实验对比评估其研究结果。

Result: 发现语言模型对模态类别分类的判断比先前研究更可靠，且模态差异向量在随训练、层数和参数量增加时呈现一致性涌现。此外，这些向量可用来模拟人类在模态分类中的精细行为，揭示了人类模态分类特征的可解释性模式。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提高了对语言模型模态分类能力的认识，还通过模态差异向量为理解人类模态分类过程提供了新的视角，并扩展了模型机制解释领域的潜力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国因芬太尼引发的药物过量致死率上升，需要快速准确的监测。然而，关键的过量数据常隐藏在文字描述的验尸报告中，通过ICD-10编码过程会导致延迟和信息丢失。基于NLP的自动化方法能改进这一过程，但目前的应用有限。

Method: 该研究使用2020年35,433条死亡记录数据进行模型训练和内部测试，并用2023-2024年3,335条数据进行外部验证。评估了多种NLP模型（包括BERT、BioClinicalBERT、Qwen 3和Llama 3）在从非结构化死亡证明文本中分类药物参与情况的表现。采用宏F1分数作为评估标准。

Result: 经过微调的BioClinicalBERT模型在内部测试中表现接近完美（宏F1分>=0.998），在外部验证中的鲁棒性表现也非常优秀（宏F1=0.966），优于传统机器学习和其他NLP模型。

Conclusion: 临床语言模型（如BioClinicalBERT）提供了一种高精度、可扩展的解决方案，用于从自由文本报告中分类药物过量死亡。这些方法可以显著加速监测流程，克服手动ICD-10编码的局限性，支持近乎实时的物质使用趋势检测。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为多模态情感分析领域设立了新标准，具备更深和更准确的数据分析能力，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

Motivation: 当前的自动化语音评估方法与人类偏好之间的相关性较低，且设计专门系统以评估多样化音频特性较为困难。

Method: 提出AudioJudge，利用LAM作为评估工具，通过语音特性检测任务和人类偏好模拟，研究其评估能力，并使用提示工程及多方面集成方法提升性能。

Conclusion: AudioJudge提供了一种统一且高效的语音评估框架，但其在冗长性和位置偏好方面仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

Conclusion: 采用FLEXITOKENS改善了语言模型对多样数据分布的适应能力，有效提高了性能；代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the

performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ThinkLogit的解码过程方法，通过较小的指南模型引导大型语言模型实现复杂的长链推理能力，并进一步推出ThinkLogit-DPO来优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否无需额外训练即可触发大型语言模型的长链推理能力，并提出高效方法实现这一目标。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方案，在解码时利用logits算术调整大型LM的长推理能力；通过ThinkLogit-DPO优化指南模型进行偏好优化训练，提升推理性能。

Result: 在四个数学数据集上，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO在指南模型的帮助下分别实现了26%和29%的pass@1相对提升。同时，ThinkLogit还能通过强化学习转移长推理技能，实现13%的额外提升。

Conclusion: 本文方法能够以最低的计算成本、极少或无需额外训练地显著提高大型模型的长链推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

*Keli Zheng,Zerong Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Synergy的语言模型，展示了无需tokenizer的可能性，并通过比较和实验验证了其性能和优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求一种能够在不同抽象层次之间进行链接并且直接处理字节的语言模型，无需依赖传统的tokenizer。

Method: 设计了一个字节级语言模型（byte-level language model）并结合了一种路由机制；通过移除位置编码实验研究更高层次抽象部分的性能表现。

Result: Synergy模型自发学习字节切分，比现有BBPE产生更少的概念tokens，性能与竞争模型（如Llama3）可比，且更高层表现不依赖位置编码。

Conclusion: 验证了无需tokenizer架构的可行性，为未来更健壮、更灵活的语言处理方法奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本编码器在应对否定语意功能方面表现欠佳，这影响了许多基于文本嵌入的下游应用。作者旨在提高文本编码器对否定语意的鲁棒性。

Method: 从大型语言模型中提取包含否定和模糊表述的多样化数据模式，通过对比学习对BERT模型进行微调。

Result: 改进后的文本编码器在否定理解能力上有显著提升，同时在通用基准上保持了竞争力表现。此外，该方法还能适配于大型语言模型，提高其在否定基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效增强文本编码器和大型语言模型对否定语意的鲁棒性，同时保持其他任务的出色性能。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在无明确音乐训练的情况下，对符号音乐建模的潜力和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在无明确音乐训练的情况下，其隐含的音乐概念能力及其生成符号音乐数据的潜力。

Method: 通过生成描述音乐流派和风格的文本提示的符号音乐数据，生成MIDI文件，并使用这些文件训练神经网络进行分类和旋律补全任务。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs能从文本中推断基本的音乐结构和时间关系，但也显示出因缺乏明确的音乐上下文而存在的局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs具有隐式编码音乐模式的潜力，但在没有明确音乐背景的情况下，仍需改进以提升其在符号音乐领域的生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

TL;DR: 探讨跨语言一致性在模型知识的事实性和语言模型性能中的重要性，并评估和改进多语言模型在这一方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估多语言模型的跨语言知识一致性，研究跨语言迁移能力及其对知识事实性和语言模型性能公平性的影响。

Method: 通过分析跨语言代码混合共指语句，使用解释性方法研究多语言模型的行为，并评估代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐目标对一致性的增强效果。

Result: 发现多语言模型对跨语言一致性的依赖受到语言家族、语言学因素以及特定层的瓶颈限制；代码切换训练和跨语言对齐技术在提升一致性和模型性能方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练是增强多语言表现及一贯性的关键方法。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Method: 将预训练语言模型改造成分层解码器，复制末层的语言生成能力到中间层，并对其进行任务微调。

Result: 分层解码器可以在多个任务上取得领先表现，包括分层文本分类、分类引导生成和分层文本生成。

Conclusion: 该研究表明了构建一个从零预训练的通用分层推理器的可能性。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

Conclusion: 解决了表格形式数据的问答问题，方法的高准确率显示了逐步分解与LLMs结合的潜力，同时证明了其可操作性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

TL;DR: SemCSE是一种无监督方法，用于学习科学文本的语义嵌入，通过对比学习和LLM生成的摘要来优化模型，使语义相关的摘要更接近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法难以准确反映文本的语义相似性，因此需要一种能更好捕捉科学文本语义内容的新方法。

Method: 利用LLM生成科学摘要，通过对比学习使语义相关的摘要在嵌入空间中更接近，从而训练模型抓住文本的真实语义内容。

Result: SemCSE在SciRepEval基准上的表现达到同规模模型的最优水平，并在新的基准测试中展现出更强的语义分离能力。

Conclusion: SemCSE展示了通过关注语义内容进行训练的优势，为科学文本的语义嵌入提供了新的方法。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

TL;DR: 本论文提议开发一个计算框架，用以识别文本中的“自我”相关方面（Self-aspects）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然“自我”作为一个多面体概念在认知科学和现象学中有所描述，但在自然语言处理中仍然缺乏深入研究。因此，有必要对“自我”进行系统的NLP分析，特别是其与心理健康等现象的关联。

Method: 计划构建“自我”方面的本体论和金标准注释数据集，同时开发和评估判别模型、生成模型及基于嵌入的检索方法。评估标准包括可解释性、与真实值的契合度、准确性及计算效率。

Result: 尚处于提议阶段，计划通过案例研究验证高性能模型在心理健康和经验现象学方面的应用效果。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在填补自然语言处理中“自我”分析的研究空白，为心理健康和现象学等领域提供有力支持。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Motivation: 探索注释中的人口统计学偏倚对任务公平性、尤其是性别歧视检测的影响程度。

Method: 利用广义线性混合模型分析人口统计特征与内容特征的影响，评估生成式AI标注是否通过人格设定提高对人类判断的对齐度，并使用可解释性AI技术解析预测依据。

Result: 统计结果表明人口统计学特征影响较小，推文内容是主要决定因素；人格引导的生成式AI方法未能显著改进标注效果，甚至在某些情况下表现退步。

Conclusion: 以内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议为重点，比人格模拟更能提高任务公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Method: 使用简单的机器学习方法分析4到5岁说南非荷兰语和科萨语儿童的录音故事，研究叙事特征。

Result: 词汇多样性和叙述长度为发展的关键指标，但发音速率等特征信息较少；特定动词和助词的使用与较低的干预需求相关。

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为GEMMAS的框架，用于分析多智能体系统内部的协作过程，并通过内部过程评估系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体评估通常专注于最终输出的准确性，而忽略了低效的沟通与协调问题带来的冗余推理和高计算成本。提出新评价方法的目的是解决这一漏洞。

Method: 通过将智能体交互建模为有向无环图，该研究提出了两个新的过程级指标：信息多样性得分（IDS）评估消息语义变化，冗余路径比例（UPR）量化冗余推理路径。

Result: 在五个基准测试中的实验表明，仅2.1%的准确度差异，可导致12.8%的IDS和80%的UPR差异，揭示了内部协作的显著差异性。

Conclusion: 单纯的结果评价不足以充分评估多智能体性能，过程级诊断能帮助设计更具解释性和资源效率的协作AI系统。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

Result: 实验表明，CAST在跨领域和跨语言任务中表现优于其他基准方法，具有更高可扩展性和更低计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST通过操控激活状态有效实现了跨任务迁移，改善了低资源场景下的任务表现，为语言模型的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

Motivation: 研究当前大语言模型在多语言推理能力上的局限性，尤其是对印地语等非英语语言的泛化能力不足。

Method: 构建了一个新的印地语类比测试集(HATS)，并通过多种提示策略对现有多语言LLMs进行基准测试，提出了一种基于认知理论的链式思维类比推理方法。

Result: 使用提出的方法显著提升了模型在印地语类比问题上的表现，但实验发现模型在提示语言为英语时表现最佳。

Conclusion: HATS填补了评估LLMs在印地语推理能力上的资源缺口，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

Method: 提出AutoSteer框架，包含三个核心组件：安全意识评分（SAS），评估模型内部安全相关层；自适应安全探测器，预测潜在有害输出；轻量级拒绝头，在检测到风险时干预生成。

Result: 在LLaVA-OV和Chameleon的安全基准测试中，AutoSteer显著降低文本、视觉及跨模态威胁的攻击成功率，同时保留模型的总体能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer为多模态AI系统的安全部署提供了一个实用、可解释且高效的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

*Jiazheng Li,Hong Lu,Kaiyue Wen,Zaiwen Yang,Jiaxuan Gao,Hongzhou Lin,Yi Wu,Jingzhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为QuestA的策略，通过在训练期间引入部分解答（问题增强）来改善多步推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究质疑RL在提高复杂问题多步推理能力上的效果，作者试图通过引入部分解答来解决这一问题。

Method: 在强化学习训练中引入问题增强策略，即通过加入部分解答减少问题难度，从而提供更具信息性的学习信号。

Result: 应用QuestA后在数学推理任务上提升了模型的准确率，并在AIME24、AIME25和HMMT25等指标上取得了最新的性能表现。

Conclusion: QuestA可改善样本效率，是强化学习扩展推理能力的实用且通用的途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文介绍了TalentCLEF 2025，这是第一个专注于技能和职位标题智能的评估活动，涵盖多语言职位匹配和基于职位标题的技能预测，吸引了76个团队和280多项提交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在人才管理领域中，可靠和公平的语言模型仍然缺乏公开数据和评估基准，因此该研究致力于填补这一空白。

Method: 建立TalentCLEF 2025评估活动，包括两个任务：多语言职位匹配（覆盖英语、西班牙语、德语、中文）和基于职位标题的技能预测（英语）。数据经过严格匿名化和人工注释，并兼顾语言多样性与性别差异。

Result: 该评估吸引了76个团队和280多次提交。大多数系统使用多语言编码器模型，结合对比学习进行微调，有些还使用大语言模型进行数据增强或重排序。结果显示训练策略对模型成果的影响比模型尺寸更大。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF 2025首次建立了该领域的公开基准，推动了劳动力市场中可靠、公正、可迁移的语言技术的发展。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

TL;DR: RCPS框架通过深度结构化叙述规划、自适应布局生成和迭代优化循环显著提升了媒体演示生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的媒体演示往往存在逻辑不一致和布局次优的问题，难以达到专业水准。为了处理这些挑战，研究者提出了RCPS框架和PREVAL评估工具。

Method: 引入了RCPS框架，集成了深度结构化叙述规划、自适应布局生成和迭代优化循环。同时，提出了PREVAL基于偏好的多维度评估工具以量化和评估演示质量。

Result: 实验结果显示，RCPS框架在所有质量维度上均显著优于基线方法，生成的演示内容接近人类专家水准。同时，PREVAL评估工具与人类评判结果表现出高度相关性。

Conclusion: RCPS框架提供了一种生成高质量媒体演示的有效方法，而PREVAL评估工具则是一个可靠的品质评测解决方案，推动了自动媒体演示生成领域的向前发展。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估目前的大语言模型是否能胜任科学研究中的复杂任务，如设计可靠的消融实验研究。

Method: 设计了名为AbGen的基准数据集，包含1,500个专家标注的例子，要求模型基于研究的上下文生成详细的消融实验设计，并开发了AbGen-Eval评估基于自动方法的评价系统的可靠性。

Result: 现有LLMs在消融实验设计的重要性、忠实性和合理性，与人类专家有显著差距；当前自动评估方法在任务中存在较大不可靠性。

Conclusion: 需要改进LLM模型在科学研究应用中的表现，以及开发更有效可靠的评估系统。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了HapticCap，一个完全由人工注释的触觉-文本配对数据集，以及haptic-caption检索任务，通过结合语言模型T5和音频模型AST，获得了最佳任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的触觉振动设计难以与用户产生共鸣，原因在于缺乏足够大的触觉数据集以及模型难以用文本描述振动信号。

Method: 创建了HapticCap数据集，包含92,070对触觉-文本配对，并提出haptic-caption检索任务，通过监督对比学习框架，将分类文本表示与触觉振动信号相匹配。

Result: 结合语言模型T5和音频模型AST的超级表现，尤其是针对每种描述类别单独训练的情况下，效果最佳。

Conclusion: 通过创造新的数据集和任务，以及提出卓越的模型组合，极大推动了触觉信号和用户文本描述的匹配研究领域。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索搜索引擎与用户的意识形态偏见查询如何共同影响搜素结果的偏差以及信息的极化。

Method: 通过一组政治和社会主题数据集分析主要搜索引擎的输出。

Result: 发现搜索引擎会优先呈现有偏见的内容，意识形态化查询会加剧偏见，同时不同搜索引擎在优先选择的来源上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 搜索引擎通过强化意识形态分裂，可能在信息极化中扮演关键角色，影响公众认知。

Abstract: Search engines play a crucial role in shaping public discourse by influencing
how information is accessed and framed. While prior research has extensively
examined various dimensions of search bias -- such as content prioritization,
indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨视觉-语言训练是否能显著改变语言模型的语义表征。结果显示，虽然语言模型和视觉-语言模型在词汇分类知识上无显著差异，但后者在任务中的表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言训练对语言模型的语义表征（特别是词汇分类知识）是否有影响。

Method: 通过比较仅基于文本的语言模型和视觉-语言模型在文本问题回答任务中的表现，分析训练对模型语义表征的影响。

Result: 视觉-语言模型虽然在语义知识上没有本质提高，但在基于语义关系问题上的任务部署能力更强。

Conclusion: 视觉-语言训练可以改善模型在任务情境中的知识运用能力，但对语义知识本身的影响有限。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为TAIL的学习方法，旨在提升大型语言模型（LLMs）对长度归纳问题的泛化能力。tail通过仿造图灵机执行过程生成链式思维数据并验证了其在多任务上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer语言模型在处理比训练时更长序列的推理问题上的局限性，提出一个更普适的解决方案。

Method: 提出图灵机模仿学习(TAIL)方法，以程序生成模仿图灵机执行过程的链式思维(COT)数据，用原子态扩展推理步骤，并引入显式存取机制，减少动态及远程数据访问的困难。

Result: TAIL在8种算法及18个任务的合成数据集上验证了其有效性，在Qwen2.5-7B任务上表现优异且优于现有方法，展示了模型在注意力层上与图灵机一致的读写行为。

Conclusion: 表明图灵机的关键概念对实现长度泛化至关重要，为从合成数据中学得推理能力提供了一个有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大部分计算幽默研究都集中在简单的基于双关语的笑话上，而少有关注更复杂的幽默形式。

Method: 构建了包含600个笑话的数据集，涵盖4种笑话形式，并手动撰写高质量解释，以评估不同大语言模型解释幽默的能力。

Result: 测试的大语言模型（包括推理模型）都无法可靠地解释所有类型的笑话。

Conclusion: 现有的计算幽默工作过于关注简单笑话形式，未来研究应面向更复杂的幽默形式展开。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large
language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain
knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI
positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement,
current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive
nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or
incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is
most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain
underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring
systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,
individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel
multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized
feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to
enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students
to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise
for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized
exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in
education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical
agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and
effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior,
i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle
technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the
operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging
car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling
generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large
parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the
simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model
for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We
couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and
dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more
realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The
proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when
validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high
fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time
efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle
development.

Conclusion: 为XRL领域的进一步研究提供方向，并强调关注更多相关领域的重要性。

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been
accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use
of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and
explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed,
grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a
sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims
to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning.
We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The
first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second
relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide
a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of
domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community.
Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

Motivation: 当前的生成系统难以捕捉静态规则和内容与动态玩家行为之间的关系，作者设计框架旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: 通过强化学习代理对游戏进行多次测试，生成数值游戏指标和图像摘要，随后由LMM设计师根据游戏目标分析这些测试结果，并调整游戏配置以实现目标。

Conclusion: 这一方法展示了AI辅助游戏设计的实用性与可拓展性，为相关设计工具提供了新方向。

Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate
into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect
only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated
design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement
learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model
(LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL
player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or
(ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer

Conclusion: 研究指出现有的欺骗探测方法虽然存在些许改进空间，但在欺骗检测上取得了一定成效，对未来的探测器开发提供了启发。

Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries.
Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to
distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive
versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are
at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to
simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade
detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor
has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without
such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white
box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white
performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance
boosts from existing deception probes.

proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and
focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.

Conclusion: 新框架将促进AI系统向人类般快速适应与通用能力发展，向通用人工智能迈进。

Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and
effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this
profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and
refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to
as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model
induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in
artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static
representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of
the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through
interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we
provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in
cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call
for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.
Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully
designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the
underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We
detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate
metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid
world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire
future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step
towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and
robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general
intelligence.

Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade,
deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already
demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific
contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a
misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to
undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing
threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic
framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we
provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant
threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a
safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines
of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we
specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation
considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the
first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety
governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate
these threats before deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 此研究提出了VAR-MATH框架用于评估大型语言模型在数学推理能力的真实性，发现在变体版本的基准测试中性能大幅下降，表明现有方法依赖表面启发式，难以泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的强化学习方法尽管提升了大型语言模型在数学推理上的表现，但实际反映的是模型训练对基准模式的过拟合，而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出了VAR-MATH框架，通过将固定的数值问题转化为符号化模板，并要求模型解决多个实例化问题，来减轻数据泄露及评估脆弱性的问题。

Result: 实验表明，在变体版本的基准测试（VAR-AMC23和VAR-AIME24）中，强化学习训练的模型尤其小型模型的表现显著下降，性能平均下降48.0%和58.3%。

Conclusion: 许多现有强化学习方法依赖浅层启发式，难以泛化，VAR-MATH提供了一种更可靠的数学推理评估范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial
improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist
even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted
rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true
reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific
patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective
and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,
\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test
problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation
fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are
highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning
consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic
evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting
fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve
multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across
structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and
improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular
benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and
VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for
RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,
with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings
suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail
to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a
principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical
reasoning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种将概率事件演算(PEC)转化为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)的方法，以实现目标导向的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PEC在不确定环境中的叙述推理方面具有优势，但它缺乏目标导向推理的机制，这限制了其实用性。

Method: 通过形式化地将PEC领域转化为MDP，引入 "采取行动的情境" 概念，以保留PEC灵活的动作语义，并开发了一种支持时间推理和目标规划的方法。

Result: 建立了PEC-MDP形式化理论，使科研人员可以将广泛的MDP算法工具运用到PEC解释性叙述领域，并展示了如何将学习到的策略映射回易理解的PEC表示。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了PEC的适用范围，在保持其可解释性的同时增强了其目标导向推理的能力。

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about
actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the
representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal
projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in
interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks
mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by
developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's
flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the
extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to
be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the
translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven
planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable
PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's
capabilities.

Conclusion: X-MILP提供了一个通用框架，用于生成易于理解的对比解释，有助于优化决策透明性。

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing
interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation,
especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes
formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic
approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint
reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes
about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we
determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by
computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set
of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons"
constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among
the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of
well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of
computing explanations.

<details>

Motivation: 目前语言模型在复杂问题求解上存在错误传播和知识整合困难，而ProbTree框架尽管通过树状推理部分解决了这些问题，但其静态实现限制了对中间结果的动态适应，并造成计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出基于动态强化学习的框架，通过实时信心估计对推理树进行增量构建，同时学习最优操作策略（分解、检索和聚合），以改进ProbTree方法的灵活性和效率。

Conclusion: 新框架建立了一个平衡概率框架可靠性与实际问题灵活性的新范式，适用于真实世界问题的解答系统。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工道德代理评估框架假设其架构透明性，而这种假设对于不透明的大型语言模型（LLM）来说已不适用，因此需要重新修订评估标准。

Method: 文章从技术哲学核心主题出发，提出了十项新的功能性标准，包括：道德一致性、情境敏感性、规范完整性、元伦理意识、系统韧性、可信度、可修正性、部分透明性、功能自主性和道德想象力。通过假设场景（如自动驾驶公交车）阐述了这些标准的实际应用。

Conclusion: 新标准更具实用性，可指导以LLM为基础的人工道德代理的设计和社会集成，推动它们朝更高的道德一致性和社会效益发展。

Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)
necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to
evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the
assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their
stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that
traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this
mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper
proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based
artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative
integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,
corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral
imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating
Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater
alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We
illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous
public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally
salient contexts.

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in
decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and
predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing
efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism
presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more
straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and
computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and
fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum
T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order
patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,
soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp
counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the
highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）评估方式的不足，并提出了一个新的评估平台——生成能量竞技场（GEA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型评估方法（如自动测试和人工评估）存在局限性，如与人类判断的相关性不高或评估成本高昂，因此需要一种更有效的方法，同时考虑到模型能耗的重要性。

Method: 引入GEA竞技场，该平台整合了能耗信息，让用户在评估语言模型时考虑其能量消耗，并基于用户反馈进行模型排序。

Result: 初步结果显示，当用户了解模型能耗时，他们倾向于选择能效高的小型模型，从而表明复杂模型的额外能耗成本未能带来显著的响应质量提升。

Conclusion: 当用户接收到能耗信息时，他们更倾向于选择节能模型，这表明，在多数用户互动场景中，权衡能耗与响应质量对模型选择起到了关键作用。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Motivation: 研究探索前沿AI模型在处理现实研究问题中的能力，以验证其接近人类专家水平的可能性。

Method: 构建FormulaOne基准，基于图论、逻辑和算法设计问题，使用MSO逻辑生成数据集，并引入FormulaOne-Warmup，用更简单任务辅助评估。

Result: 当前最先进模型（如OpenAI的o3）在该基准上表现不佳，解题成功率不足1%，说明其能力在某些领域远低于人类专家。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使是最先进的AI模型，在复杂科研问题上的表现仍有很大提升空间，这为新算法和理论研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close
are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can
tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific
understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn
away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on
real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph
theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of
frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of
reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of
commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,
such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is
generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)
logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;
ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately
related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central
conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As
such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known
results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on
FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts
and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from
expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we
additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from
the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive
evaluation framework.

Conclusion: 强化学习与创新训练方法显著提升了语言模型的长远推理能力，并公开发布模型以促进研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate
continued research, we release our model publicly.

Method: 基于复杂性理论对串行和并行计算的区别进行正式化阐述，并分析现有并行计算架构在串行任务中的局限。

Result: 表明当前以并行为中心的机器学习架构，在处理不可并行化的串行任务时存在根本性限制。

Conclusion: 随着人工智能解决更复杂的推理任务，必须在串行计算能力的扩展上下功夫，才能推动机器学习的发展。

Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we
identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential.
These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical
simulations to sequential decision-making-require dependent computational steps
that cannot be parallelized. Drawing from complexity theory, we formalize this
distinction and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face
fundamental limitations on such tasks. We argue that recognizing the serial
nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model
design, hardware development. As AI tackles increasingly complex reasoning,
deliberately scaling serial computation-not just parallel computation-is
essential for continued progress.

Motivation: 传统激活函数（如ReLU）在处理数据拓扑结构时有局限性，尤其是在低维层的训练中表现不够理想。

Method: 设计了两种新的拓扑激活函数，SmoothSplit和ParametricSplit，提升网络对复杂数据流形的转换能力，特别是在低维条件下进行拓扑切割。

Result: ParametricSplit在低维设置中表现优于传统激活函数，同时在高维情况下依然保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知的激活函数有潜力推进神经网络结构的设计，为低维数据训练提供显著优势。

Abstract: This study explores novel activation functions that enhance the ability of
neural networks to manipulate data topology during training. Building on the
limitations of traditional activation functions like $\mathrm{ReLU}$, we
propose $\mathrm{SmoothSplit}$ and $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$, which introduce
topology "cutting" capabilities. These functions enable networks to transform
complex data manifolds effectively, improving performance in scenarios with
low-dimensional layers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{ParametricSplit}$ outperforms
traditional activations in low-dimensional settings while maintaining
competitive performance in higher-dimensional ones. Our findings highlight the
potential of topology-aware activation functions in advancing neural network
architectures. The code is available via

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory
responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent
reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as
explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform
tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs,
and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle
with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process,
which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned
actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how
to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this
could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine
thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three
auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery
Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences
or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We
conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented
and discussed.

Method: 提出了一种融合概念漂移检测器并结合在线K-d树的动态集成选择(IncA-DES)方法。

Conclusion: IncA-DES在保持高精度的同时显著提高了处理效率，适合各种标签可用性水平的数据流场景。

Abstract: Data streams pose challenges not usually encountered in batch-based ML. One
of them is concept drift, which is characterized by the change in data
distribution over time. Among many approaches explored in literature, the
fusion of classifiers has been showing good results and is getting growing
attention. DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an
efficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid
to adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order
to create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may
become prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data. In this work, we
propose IncA-DES, which employs a training strategy that promotes the
generation of local experts with the assumption that different regions of the
feature space become available with time. Additionally, the fusion of a concept
drift detector supports the maintenance of information and adaptation to a new
concept. An overlap-based classification filter is also employed in order to
avoid using the DS method when there is a consensus in the neighborhood, a
strategy that we argue every DS method should employ, as it was shown to make
them more applicable and quicker. Moreover, aiming to reduce the processing
time of the kNN, we propose an Online K-d tree algorithm, which can quickly
remove instances without becoming inconsistent and deals with unbalancing
concerns that may occur in data streams. Experimental results showed that the
proposed framework got the best average accuracy compared to seven
state-of-the-art methods considering different levels of label availability and
presented the smaller processing time between the most accurate methods.
Additionally, the fusion with the Online K-d tree has improved processing time
with a negligible loss in accuracy. We have made our framework available in an
online repository.

Conclusion: Assay2Mol能够充分利用现有筛选数据，优化候选分子的生成，助力药物发现领域。

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside
descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the
functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets.
Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these
targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of
assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been
untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large
language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing
biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol
retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target
and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved
assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches
that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while
also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Result: KRCA在合成和真实数据集上表现出色，显著提升了解决方案质量并提高计算效率。

Conclusion: KRC研究为个性化和大规模决策提供新工具，建议未来研究可在此基础上进一步探索。

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering ranking vectors, where each vector
represents preferences as an ordered list of distinct integers. Specifically,
we focus on the k-centroids ranking vectors clustering problem (KRC), which
aims to partition a set of ranking vectors into k clusters and identify the
centroid of each cluster. Unlike classical k-means clustering (KMC), KRC
constrains both the observations and centroids to be ranking vectors. We
establish the NP-hardness of KRC and characterize its feasible set. For the
single-cluster case, we derive a closed-form analytical solution for the
optimal centroid, which can be computed in linear time. To address the
computational challenges of KRC, we develop an efficient approximation
algorithm, KRCA, which iteratively refines initial solutions from KMC, referred
to as the baseline solution. Additionally, we introduce a branch-and-bound
(BnB) algorithm for efficient cluster reconstruction within KRCA, leveraging a
decision tree framework to reduce computational time while incorporating a
controlling parameter to balance solution quality and efficiency. We establish
theoretical error bounds for KRCA and BnB. Through extensive numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that KRCA
consistently outperforms baseline solutions, delivering significant
improvements in solution quality with fast computational times. This work
highlights the practical significance of KRC for personalization and
large-scale decision making, offering methodological advancements and insights
that can be built upon in future studies.

Motivation: 在现有研究中，基于对数损失的分类器在一般化边界上优于平方损失分类器。作者探讨是否存在能够实现与方差相关边界的损失函数以进一步改进结果。

Method: 提出了一种新型损失函数"betting loss"，通过其实现无需依赖方差信息来获得与方差相关的边界。

Result: 证明了betting loss能够实现与数据方差相关的更精细泛化边界，这是对现有一阶界的改进。

Conclusion: 本文的研究方法展示了如何在未明确使用标签分布或方差信息的情况下，通过调整损失函数来实现更优的一般化性能。

Abstract: We consider the $[0,1]$-valued regression problem in the i.i.d. setting. In a
related problem called cost-sensitive classification, \citet{foster21efficient}
have shown that the log loss minimizer achieves an improved generalization
bound compared to that of the squared loss minimizer in the sense that the
bound scales with the cost of the best classifier, which can be arbitrarily
small depending on the problem at hand. Such a result is often called a
first-order bound. For $[0,1]$-valued regression, we first show that the log
loss minimizer leads to a similar first-order bound. We then ask if there
exists a loss function that achieves a variance-dependent bound (also known as
a second order bound), which is a strict improvement upon first-order bounds.
We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a novel loss function
called the betting loss. Our result is ``variance-adaptive'' in the sense that
the bound is attained \textit{without any knowledge about the variance}, which
is in contrast to modeling label (or reward) variance or the label distribution
itself explicitly as part of the function class such as distributional
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 解决异质表格数据在元学习中的表示问题，特别是为贝叶斯超参数优化任务提供一个高效的冷启动机制。

Method: 提出两种表示学习算法：一种基于深度度量学习，另一种基于标记器重构，并评估其效果。

Result: 新方法虽能捕获标记器属性，但实际上对目标元任务效能提升有限。

Conclusion: 当前方法对表格表示及标记器捕获表现良好，但在元任务中需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning
purposes is still an open problem. Previous approaches rely on representations
that are intended to be universal. This paper proposes two novel methods for
tabular representation learning tailored to a specific meta-task -
warm-starting Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization. Both follow the specific
requirement formulated by ourselves that enforces representations to capture
the properties of landmarkers. The first approach involves deep metric
learning, while the second one is based on landmarkers reconstruction. We
evaluate the proposed encoders in two ways. Next to the gain in the target
meta-task, we also use the degree of fulfillment of the proposed requirement as
the evaluation metric. Experiments demonstrate that while the proposed encoders
can effectively learn representations aligned with landmarkers, they may not
directly translate to significant performance gains in the meta-task of HPO
warm-starting.

Motivation: 现有方法在选择任务数据集混合比例时主要依赖人工和启发式方法，缺乏系统和自动化的方式来优化大语言模型的性能。

Method: 提出的TASKPGM框架利用马尔科夫随机场（MRF）上的能量函数，通过连续任务比例优化任务选择。任务关系通过行为发散（如Jensen Shannon Divergence和点互信息）建模，并提供了简单约束下的闭式解。

Result: 该方法在Llama 2和Mistral模型上表现出稳定的性能改进，并在MMLU和BIGBench等评估集上取得了优异成绩。同时，该方法具有解释任务影响和混合组成的能力。

Conclusion: TASKPGM是一种高效且稳健的LLM微调工具，不仅提升了表现，还提供了对任务影响的可解释性、任务多样性和代表性的平衡。

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically
on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend
of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with
practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We
introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization
that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over
a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral
divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information
computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our
method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably
balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical
guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate
consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation
suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers
interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a
powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

Conclusion: Bootseer框架有效优化了LLM训练的启动过程，为资源密集型AI训练提供了更加高效的解决方案。在大规模训练环境下具有显著的实践意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving
breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs
involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is
important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup
overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training
efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly
critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs
begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,
industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams
operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more
than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training
startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of
startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job
size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level
optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)
container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model
checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three
techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and
(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment
and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in
startup overhead.

Result: 发现推理微调过程中，预新方向被重新利用，形成新的行为电路，基础模型的某些方向在推理模型中被重新编码后能诱导反向追踪。

Conclusion: 推理微调是重用基础模型已有表征的过程，而非从零开始学习新能力。

Abstract: Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has
been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities.
Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors,
but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show
that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part
driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations.
Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream
which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled
reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction
cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that
this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that
the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to
form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction
is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings
offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose
pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities
from scratch.

Motivation: 现有神经接口技术虽然有望成为下一代高带宽输入设备，但其信号编码中包含个人敏感信息，数据共享面临隐私挑战。

Method: 研究提出并评估基于FL的神经解码框架，并在开环和闭环场景中测试其性能与隐私保护能力，闭环用户研究中修改FL方法以适应单用户实时交互。

Result: 开环场景下，FL性能优于本地学习基准；闭环场景中修改的FL方法性能低于本地学习，但本地学习存在更大的隐私风险。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了实时自适应应用中的性能与隐私权衡，强调了为适应单用户实时使用而专门设计FL方法的必要性。

Abstract: Invasive and non-invasive neural interfaces hold promise as high-bandwidth
input devices for next-generation technologies. However, neural signals
inherently encode sensitive information about an individual's identity and
health, making data sharing for decoder training a critical privacy challenge.
Federated learning (FL), a distributed, privacy-preserving learning framework,
presents a promising solution, but it remains unexplored in closed-loop
adaptive neural interfaces. Here, we introduce FL-based neural decoding and
systematically evaluate its performance and privacy using high-dimensional
electromyography signals in both open- and closed-loop scenarios. In open-loop
simulations, FL significantly outperformed local learning baselines,
demonstrating its potential for high-performance, privacy-conscious neural
decoding. In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to
accommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by
standard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing
the adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still
carried higher privacy risks. Our findings highlight a critical
performance-privacy tradeoff in real-time adaptive applications and indicate
the need for FL methods specifically designed for co-adaptive, single-user
applications.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that
incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process,
making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering
problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful
framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to
improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often
exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are
highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we
introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation
capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an
extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected
collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form
of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our
method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average
of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all
without a significant increase in computational cost. The code is available at

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a prevalent issue, stemming from various conflicting
factors, making its utilization complex. This uncertainty, particularly
resulting from disparities in data formats, frequently necessitates the
involvement of experts to find resolutions. Current methodologies primarily
address conflicts related to data structures and schemas, often overlooking the
pivotal role played by data transformation. As the utilization of artificial

streamlined data preparation process, and data transformation becomes
paramount. It customizes training data to enhance AI learning efficiency and
adapts input formats to suit diverse AI models. Selecting an appropriate
transformation technique is paramount in preserving crucial data details.
Despite the widespread integration of AI across various industries,
comprehensive reviews concerning contemporary data transformation approaches
are scarce. This survey explores the intricacies of data heterogeneity and its
underlying sources. It systematically categorizes and presents strategies to
address heterogeneity stemming from differences in data formats, shedding light
on the inherent challenges associated with each strategy.

Conclusion: PinFM成功地大规模部署，大幅提升了推荐系统性能，为超5亿用户提供服务。

Abstract: User activity sequences have emerged as one of the most important signals in
recommender systems. We present a foundational model, PinFM, for understanding
user activity sequences across multiple applications at a billion-scale visual
discovery platform. We pretrain a transformer model with 20B+ parameters using
extensive user activity data, then fine-tune it for specific applications,
efficiently coupling it with existing models. While this
pretraining-and-fine-tuning approach has been popular in other domains, such as
Vision and NLP, its application in industrial recommender systems presents
numerous challenges. The foundational model must be scalable enough to score
millions of items every second while meeting tight cost and latency constraints
imposed by these systems. Additionally, it should capture the interactions
between user activities and other features and handle new items that were not
present during the pretraining stage.
  We developed innovative techniques to address these challenges. Our
infrastructure and algorithmic optimizations, such as the Deduplicated
Cross-Attention Transformer (DCAT), improved our throughput by 600% on
Pinterest internal data. We demonstrate that PinFM can learn interactions
between user sequences and candidate items by altering input sequences, leading
to a 20% increase in engagement with new items. PinFM is now deployed to help
improve the experience of more than a half billion users across various
applications.

Conclusion: 该研究首次理论上解释了深度神经网络训练后观测到的'bulk+tail'光谱结构，为理解深度学习的有效性提供了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized machine learning, yet their training
dynamics remain theoretically unclear-we develop a continuous-time,
matrix-valued stochastic differential equation (SDE) framework that rigorously
connects the microscopic dynamics of SGD to the macroscopic evolution of
singular-value spectra in weight matrices. We derive exact SDEs showing that
squared singular values follow Dyson Brownian motion with eigenvalue repulsion,
and characterize stationary distributions as gamma-type densities with
power-law tails, providing the first theoretical explanation for the
empirically observed 'bulk+tail' spectral structure in trained networks.
Through controlled experiments on transformer and MLP architectures, we
validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate quantitative agreement
between SDE-based forecasts and observed spectral evolution, providing a
rigorous foundation for understanding why deep learning works.

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across

adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Conclusion: LySep模型提供了一种有效改进深度学习求解偏微分方程的方法，理论支持与数值实验共同证明其显著优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new optimization framework, the layer separation
(LySep) model, to improve the deep learning-based methods in solving partial
differential equations. Due to the highly non-convex nature of the loss
function in deep learning, existing optimization algorithms often converge to
suboptimal local minima or suffer from gradient explosion or vanishing,
resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary
variables to separate the layers of deep neural networks. Specifically, the
output and its derivatives of each layer are represented by auxiliary
variables, effectively decomposing the deep architecture into a series of
shallow architectures. New loss functions with auxiliary variables are
established, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.
Corresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where
many variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and
the original deep model. High-dimensional numerical results validate our theory
and demonstrate the advantages of LySep in minimizing loss and reducing
solution error.

Conclusion: FLDmamba在解决时序预测中的多重挑战上表现出色，具备广泛应用潜力并提升了方法的再现性。

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces
significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data,
including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics,
particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based
architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence
length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements
in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for
long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and
transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise
issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier
and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations.
FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to
effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within
time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise
issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior
performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both
Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the
reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible

Motivation: 当前基因组数据压缩存在压缩率不足、吞吐量低和鲁棒性差的问题，限制其在工业和学术界的广泛应用。

Method: 通过自动化多知识学习框架作为压缩器的骨干，结合GPU加速的($s$,$k$)-mer编码器、数据块分区与分步模型传递（SMP）机制，实现压缩吞吐量和资源利用优化。设计了两种压缩模式（PMKLC-S和PMKLC-M），分别面向单GPU和多GPU场景。

Conclusion: PMKLC在压缩率、吞吐量、鲁棒性和资源消耗上表现优异，可有效支持不同概率分布的基因组数据压缩需求，并适应内存有限的设备环境。

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained

Motivation: 解决偏微分方程在多查询场景中计算强度高的问题，如实时预测和不确定性量化，同时克服ROM针对网格灵活性不足的局限性。

Method: 提出RONOM框架，将ROM的严格误差估计与算子学习的无限维空间适应性结合，并建立了离散误差上界。

Result: 数值实验对比表明，RONOM在输入泛化、空间超分辨率和离散鲁棒性方面表现优异，并提供了时间超分辨率的新见解。

Conclusion: RONOM结合了ROM和算子学习的优势，能够灵活适应不同分辨率的数据，并提供了新的误差估计方法和性能提升。

Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based
modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios,
such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification.
Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a
low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which
limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning
approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to
data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical
error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization
convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the
infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the
reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges
concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error
bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization
convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are
presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial
differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard
vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input
generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and
discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal
super-resolution scenarios.

Result: ReLOAD在D4RL基准测试中展现了鲁棒的离线策略学习性能，与传统奖励注释方法的表现相竞争。

Conclusion: 通过内在奖励信号替代手工奖励注释，ReLOAD框架为离线强化学习提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a
static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions.
However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit
reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain
retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning
with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation
framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex
alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to
generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet
effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to
mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.
Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal
for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured
reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a
formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction
errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like
transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables
robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with
traditional reward-annotated methods.

Result: 发现更大的学习率促使最终NTK主特征向量和训练目标的对齐度更高，并揭示了背后的机制。

Conclusion: 研究提高了对深度学习中梯度下降训练动态和NTK在EoS期间行为的理解。

Abstract: The study of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) in deep learning has drawn
increasing attention in recent years. NTKs typically actively change during
training and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on
Gradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in
which the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely
proportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored
the underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the
understanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still
missing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in
detail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates
cause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK
matrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the
underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for
a two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training
dynamics in deep learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于NAMMD的新方法，用于分布接近性测试，提升了测试能力，并适用于更复杂的数据类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布接近性测试基于一维离散空间（如全变差）设计，无法很好地应用于复杂数据（如图像）。

Method: 通过引入最大均值差异（MMD）并改进为规范自适应MMD（NAMMD），作为新的分布差异度量方法。同时基于NAMMD设计了分布接近性测试方法。

Result: 理论证明了基于NAMMD的测试方法拥有更高的测试能力和控制的I型错误率，并通过多种数据实验（如合成噪声、真实图像）验证了有效性。

Conclusion: NAMMD方法不仅提升了分布接近性测试的能力，还在两样本检测任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: The distribution closeness testing (DCT) assesses whether the distance
between a distribution pair is at least $\epsilon$-far. Existing DCT methods
mainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete
one-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their
applications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of
data, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful
measurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex
distributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the
same for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when
assessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the
issue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive
MMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.
Based on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the
NAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.
Theoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to
MMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive
experiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).
Furthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample
testing problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than
the MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.

Conclusion: CSI的扰动能够稳定地编码生物特征，为低成本、无设备、基于Wi-Fi的人体识别在现实场景中的可行性提供了验证。

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing is gaining momentum as a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based systems for human identification. However, person
identification through wireless signals, particularly without user motion,
remains largely unexplored. Most prior wireless-based approaches rely on
movement patterns, such as walking gait, to extract biometric cues. In
contrast, we propose a transformer-based method that identifies individuals
from Channel State Information (CSI) recorded while the subject remains
stationary. CSI captures fine-grained amplitude and phase distortions induced
by the unique interaction between the human body and the radio signal. To
support evaluation, we introduce a dataset acquired with ESP32 devices in a
controlled indoor environment, featuring six participants observed across
multiple orientations. A tailored preprocessing pipeline, including outlier
removal, smoothing, and phase calibration, enhances signal quality. Our
dual-branch transformer architecture processes amplitude and phase modalities
separately and achieves 99.82\% classification accuracy, outperforming

### [174] [Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856)
*Chongli Qin,Jost Tobias Springenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了监督微调（SFT）与强化学习（RL）的联系，提出了基于重要性加权的SFT（iw-SFT），这是一种优化RL目标的变体，能提高性能并与RL算法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模语言模型和控制策略的优化方法，并探索如何改进现有的SFT方法，以提高模型性能。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示了SFT本质上最大化了RL目标的一个下界，并基于此提出了一种重要性加权的SFT变体（iw-SFT）。该方法优化了更紧的RL目标下界，且采用质量评分数据进行进一步推广。

Result: 实验结果表明，iw-SFT在大规模语言模型和连续控制任务上表现优越，例如在AIME 2024数据集上取得了66.7%的成绩。

Conclusion: iw-SFT是一种简单易实现且可推广的框架，能有效优化RL目标，其性能可以与更复杂的RL方法相媲美。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant
paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as
for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection
between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal
policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we
clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL
objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good
performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT
leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL
as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve
performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as
importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to
implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data.
The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for
large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks.
For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of biometric authentication using EEG
signals acquired through in-ear devices, commonly referred to as ear-EEG.
Traditional EEG-based biometric systems, while secure, often suffer from low
usability due to cumbersome scalp-based electrode setups. In this study, we
propose a novel and practical framework leveraging ear-EEG signals as a
user-friendly alternative for everyday biometric authentication. The system
extracts an original combination of temporal and spectral features from ear-EEG
signals and feeds them into a fully connected deep neural network for subject
identification. Experimental results on the only currently available ear-EEG
dataset suitable for different purposes, including biometric authentication,
demonstrate promising performance, with an average accuracy of 82\% in a
subject identification scenario. These findings confirm the potential of
ear-EEG as a viable and deployable direction for next-generation real-world
biometric systems.

Motivation: 因数据匮乏和异构性难题，进一步扩展双臂机器人控制能力的基础研究尤为需要解决。

Method: 提出VIDAR框架，结合了基于750K视频的扩散视频预训练与掩码逆动态模型进行动作预测。

Result: 在仅需20分钟的人工演示下，可实现对新任务和背景的泛化，效果超越现有技术。

Conclusion: VIDAR架构展示了视频基础模型和动作预测方法在实际机器操控中的可扩展性和普适性潜力。

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种方法使得分类器能够拒绝无法提供高质量解释的输入预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用如信用评分中，用户对预测解释的高质量需求导致需要避开难以解释或难以相信的预测结果。

Method: 设计了一个拒绝低质量解释的框架LtX，提出了以用户为中心的低质量解释拒绝器ULER，该方法基于人工评级与特征相关性判断学习rejector。

Result: ULER在八个分类和回归基准以及一个新的人工标注数据集上均优于现有方法，并公开了该数据集以促进后续研究。

Conclusion: ULER框架有效提升了解释质量的筛选能力，为提升用户信任和决策支持提供了新路径。

Abstract: Machine Learning predictors are increasingly being employed in high-stakes
applications such as credit scoring. Explanations help users unpack the reasons
behind their predictions, but are not always "high quality''. That is,
end-users may have difficulty interpreting or believing them, which can
complicate trust assessment and downstream decision-making. We argue that
classifiers should have the option to refuse handling inputs whose predictions
cannot be explained properly and introduce a framework for learning to reject
low-quality explanations (LtX) in which predictors are equipped with a rejector
that evaluates the quality of explanations. In this problem setting, the key
challenges are how to properly define and assess explanation quality and how to
design a suitable rejector. Focusing on popular attribution techniques, we
introduce ULER (User-centric Low-quality Explanation Rejector), which learns a
simple rejector from human ratings and per-feature relevance judgments to
mirror human judgments of explanation quality. Our experiments show that ULER
outperforms both state-of-the-art and explanation-aware learning to reject
strategies at LtX on eight classification and regression benchmarks and on a
new human-annotated dataset, which we will publicly release to support future
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fremer是一种高效且精准的深度预测模型，用于云服务工作负载预测，展现出较传统Transformer模型更优的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进云环境下工作负载预测的效率和准确性，解决Transformer模型在大规模云环境中的计算效率不足问题。

Method: 提出Fremer模型，利用频域方法处理复杂周期性模式的时间序列数据，并基于高质量的开源数据集进行验证。

Result: Fremer在MSE、MAE和SMAPE指标上较SOTA模型分别提升5.5%、4.7%和8.6%，同时减少参数规模和计算成本。

Conclusion: Fremer提供了云环境中高效精准的工作负载预测工具，并通过实验证明其在多项任务和实际应用中均具备显著优势。

Abstract: Workload forecasting is pivotal in cloud service applications, such as
auto-scaling and scheduling, with profound implications for operational
efficiency. Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated
remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls
short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given
that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing
these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this
end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model.
Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior
efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it
achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period
series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source
workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing
workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on
both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer
consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of
5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while
simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally,
in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average
latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its
practical efficacy in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过使用预测不确定性来增强模型解释性，结合经典解释方法，提出了一种基于不确定性分析的解释框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型复杂性的不断提升，其可解释性逐渐下降，特别是对于深度学习模型，透明度问题引发了更多关注。

Method: 通过将预测不确定性分为数据相关的不确定性（Aleatoric）和模型相关的不确定性（Epistemic），使用Epistemic不确定性作为排除不可靠解释的标准，而Aleatoric不确定性用于选择适当的特征重要性或反事实解释方法。

Result: 实验表明，该不确定性感知的方法在传统机器学习和深度学习场景下对解释的鲁棒性和可达性有显著影响。

Conclusion: 将预测不确定性与经典解释框架结合，可以有效提升模型解释质量与透明度，同时为改进训练流程提供新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have emphasized the need for
transparency in model predictions, particularly as interpretability diminishes
when using increasingly complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
leveraging prediction uncertainty as a complementary approach to classical
explainability methods. Specifically, we distinguish between aleatoric
(data-related) and epistemic (model-related) uncertainty to guide the selection
of appropriate explanations. Epistemic uncertainty serves as a rejection
criterion for unreliable explanations and, in itself, provides insight into
insufficient training (a new form of explanation). Aleatoric uncertainty
informs the choice between feature-importance explanations and counterfactual
explanations. This leverages a framework of explainability methods driven by
uncertainty quantification and disentanglement. Our experiments demonstrate the
impact of this uncertainty-aware approach on the robustness and attainability
of explanations in both traditional machine learning and deep learning
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决因噪声引入的DNA序列恢复问题，为DNA数据存储及检索过程提供更好的技术支持。

Method: 通过训练语言模型，利用next-token预测机制实现trace reconstruction，使用合成数据预训练并在真实数据上进行微调。

Result: TReconLM显著优于现有算法和深度学习方法，可更高效地恢复无误的序列。

Conclusion: TReconLM是一种有效的trace reconstruction方法，有潜力提升DNA数据存储和检索的准确性与效率。

Abstract: The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的策略梯度方法在稀疏奖励环境下容易出现不稳定性和样本低效问题。本文旨在通过改进算法来提高稳定性和样本利用效率。

Method: 提出了两个方法：1) 引入预训练、稳定的引导策略来提供离策略经验以正则化目标策略训练；2) 利用零奖励样本并将其视为由专家策略引导的独立批次，从而提升样本效率。

Result: 理论分析表明，这些方法在强化学习理论框架内收敛至最优解，并在探索与利用之间实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 混合策略框架提高了训练稳定性和效率，为更稳健的策略优化提供了有前景的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel modifications to the Differentiable Automatic
Post-editing Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, approached from a mixed-policy
perspective. Standard policy gradient methods can suffer from instability and
sample inefficiency, particularly in sparse reward settings. To address this,
we first propose a method that incorporates a pre-trained, stable guiding
policy ($\piphi$) to provide off-policy experience, thereby regularizing the
training of the target policy ($\pion$). This approach improves training
stability and convergence speed by adaptively adjusting the learning step size.
Secondly, we extend this idea to re-utilize zero-reward samples, which are
often discarded by dynamic sampling strategies like DAPO's. By treating these
samples as a distinct batch guided by the expert policy, we further enhance
sample efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis for both methods,
demonstrating that their objective functions converge to the optimal solution
within the established theoretical framework of reinforcement learning. The
proposed mixed-policy framework effectively balances exploration and
exploitation, promising more stable and efficient policy optimization.

Conclusion: MC$^2$A框架展示了硬件加速MCMC技术可行性，推动了其在不同领域的应用普及。

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms
for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine
learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility
for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC
acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to
maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end
applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware
co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC
acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity
through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd
dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and
memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware
accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels
with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,
reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular
access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel
sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the
end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$,
$1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU
and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC
workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general
hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型推理链中初始错误传播的问题，并提高错误检测的准确性。

Method: 提出ARES概率框架，通过仅基于之前评估过的可靠前提来判断每一步推理的正确性，从而统计并防止错误传播。

Result: ARES在四项基准测试中获得72.1%的Macro-F1分数，提升了8.2个百分点，并在长推理链上的错误检测表现出色，达到90.3%的F1分数，提升了27.6个百分点。

Conclusion: ARES是一种有效的工具，能够增强推理链中错误检测的鲁棒性，同时为每一步推理提供统计保证，显著提高了检测性能。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Abstract: Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,
which is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often
carry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly
through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for
uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.
In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal
large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using
large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range
of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and
tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and
cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the
influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating
directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal
practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into
the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper
mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted
multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model
transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations:

Conclusion: 通过公平算法改进的光谱储存器模型，可以有效控制平滑程度，为图神经网络任务，特别是图分类问题，提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a
preprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying
layer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence
of graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This
work revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir
Graph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a
variant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of
surface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band
spectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted
to the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral
formulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks
where smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph
classification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical
analysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it
shows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the
contribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the
MRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest
promising directions for future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable
multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing
their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However,
training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant
computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings.
Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many
underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying
capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due
to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling
to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data
and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw
form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized
environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address
the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous
U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under
strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether
real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows
that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across
key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation
scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in
multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several
benchmarks. Find our code at https://github.com/youssefga28/HuSCF-GAN.

Result: 通过在Office-Caltech-10、CIFAR-10和Synthetic数据集上的实验验证，FedGA显著提升了公平性指标（如方差和基尼系数），同时保持了强劲的整体性能。

Conclusion: FedGA算法能够有效缓解联邦学习中的公平性问题，同时不损害模型的整体性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fairness has emerged as one of the key challenges in federated learning. In
horizontal federated settings, data heterogeneity often leads to substantial
performance disparities across clients, raising concerns about equitable model
behavior. To address this issue, we propose FedGA, a fairness-aware federated
learning algorithm. We first employ the Gini coefficient to measure the
performance disparity among clients. Based on this, we establish a relationship
between the Gini coefficient $G$ and the update scale of the global model
${U_s}$, and use this relationship to adaptively determine the timing of
fairness intervention. Subsequently, we dynamically adjust the aggregation
weights according to the system's real-time fairness status, enabling the
global model to better incorporate information from clients with relatively
poor performance.We conduct extensive experiments on the Office-Caltech-10,
CIFAR-10, and Synthetic datasets. The results show that FedGA effectively
improves fairness metrics such as variance and the Gini coefficient, while
maintaining strong overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Result: 在多个领域中显著提升了LLM的交叉熵和解释方差指标。

Conclusion: 新方法在保持通用任务性能的同时增强了领域特定的SAE可解释性，为LLM的机制解释性研究提供了新可能。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Conclusion: 模型在捕捉关系和几何变换的相关性方面具有创新性，尤其在进行关系特定几何变换分配时效果显著。

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between
symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their
feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent
relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)
KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such
as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These
geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific
structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs
by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific
transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by
ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite
version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent
all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how
well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this
ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each
relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply
across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT
in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we
use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low
dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The
effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations
on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a
performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a
fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured
and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and
outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and
IRL techniques.

*Ahmed Emam,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为CFR的框架，结合LRP Attention Rollout与DDU估计来分析模型的不确定性对相关性热图解释性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的卫星图像及机器学习方法在解释性和不确定性意识方面存在不足，且未充分研究不确定性对自然性评估的影响，因此需要更好的方法来改进解释性和不确定性分析。

Method: 提出Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR)框架，将LRP Attention Rollout与Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU)估计相结合，分析不确定性对卫星图像自然性评估中相关性热图解释性的影响。

Result: 通过CFR分析发现，CFR对灌木丛、森林和湿地的相关性分配更高，结果与其他研究一致。同时，当不确定性增加时，热图的解释性下降，熵值增大，表明归因更不明确且选择性减少。

Conclusion: CFR提供了一种基于不确定性分区和数据驱动的框架，可用来评估卫星图像模式与自然性的相关性，并揭示不确定性如何影响热图解释性。

Abstract: Protected natural areas play a vital role in ecological balance and ecosystem
services. Monitoring these regions at scale using satellite imagery and machine
learning is promising, but current methods often lack interpretability and
uncertainty-awareness, and do not address how uncertainty affects naturalness
assessment. In contrast, we propose Confidence-Filtered Relevance (CFR), a
data-centric framework that combines LRP Attention Rollout with Deep
Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) estimation to analyze how model uncertainty
influences the interpretability of relevance heatmaps. CFR partitions the
dataset into subsets based on uncertainty thresholds, enabling systematic
analysis of how uncertainty shapes the explanations of naturalness in satellite
imagery. Applied to the AnthroProtect dataset, CFR assigned higher relevance to
shrublands, forests, and wetlands, aligning with other research on naturalness
assessment. Moreover, our analysis shows that as uncertainty increases, the
interpretability of these relevance heatmaps declines and their entropy grows,
indicating less selective and more ambiguous attributions. CFR provides a
data-centric approach to assess the relevance of patterns to naturalness in
satellite imagery based on their associated certainty.

Conclusion: 研究为未来长期时间序列预测中Transformer架构设计提供了指导，并验证了分类方法的有效性，开放代码以促进发展。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.

Motivation: 探讨可数无限图在顶点置换形成的假设类中，可学习性的关键性质及其等价性是否能帮助理解图的结构和标签学习问题。

Method: 利用PAC和在线学习理论，结合描述集合论和可计算性理论，将无限图分类，并研究置换对学习能力的影响及其所需条件。

Result: 证明有限支持图的PAC可学习性等价于自动结构的平凡性，表明k-顶点和2-顶点置换学习等价，并给出四类无限图的分类及复杂度特性。

Conclusion: 通过以置换为角度分析无限图的可学习性，明确各类图的学习条件和复杂度，为理解图结构与学习模型交互提供理论框架。

Abstract: We study PAC and online learnability of hypothesis classes formed by copies
of a countably infinite graph G, where each copy is induced by permuting G's
vertices. This corresponds to learning a graph's labeling, knowing its
structure and label set. We consider classes where permutations move only
finitely many vertices. Our main result shows that PAC learnability of all such
finite-support copies implies online learnability of the full isomorphism type
of G, and is equivalent to the condition of automorphic triviality. We also
characterize graphs where copies induced by swapping two vertices are not
learnable, using a relaxation of the extension property of the infinite random
graph. Finally, we show that, for all G and k>2, learnability for k-vertex
permutations is equivalent to that for 2-vertex permutations, yielding a
four-class partition of infinite graphs, whose complexity we also determine
using tools coming from both descriptive set theory and computability theory.

Conclusion: DASViT弥补了可微搜索在视觉Transformer中的空白，并提供了一种更为高效和创新的设计方案，为神经网络设计带来进步。

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Motivation: 现有的解释性AI方法在模型无关性、确定性及收敛性方面存在局限性，难以广泛适用于不同任务需求，因此需要一种兼具这些特性的通用方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为MUPAX的方法，其通过测度理论和结构化扰动分析，以确定性的方式分配特征重要性，消除伪相关性并发现输入数据模式，适用于任意损失函数与维度的数据分析。

Result: MUPAX在一维音频分类、二维图像分类、三维医学影像分析以及解剖标记检测中均表现出色。与其他方法在屏蔽数据时性能下降不同，MUPAX通过采集重要模式增强了模型准确性。

Conclusion: MUPAX为可解释性AI领域带来了一种通用而有效的解决方案，具有明确性、一致性和通用性的优势，是实现可信AI的关键工具。

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model
agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM
AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable
explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems.
The source code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该框架验证了跨模态知识蒸馏在增强EEG学习中的潜力，为BCI应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a fundamental modality for cognitive state
monitoring in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it is highly
susceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which
lead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG
learning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer
knowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.
Nevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label
misalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual
feature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create
discrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper
addresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined
labels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that
mitigates both modality and label inconsistencies. It aligns feature semantics
through a prototype-based similarity module and introduces a task-specific
distillation head to resolve label-induced inconsistency in supervision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves EEG-based emotion
regression and classification performance, outperforming both unimodal and
multimodal baselines on a public multimodal dataset. These findings highlight
the potential of our framework for BCI applications.

Conclusion: NGTM不仅保留生成质量，还显著提升了图生成过程的语义可解释性和用户控制力。

Abstract: Graph generation plays a pivotal role across numerous domains, including
molecular design and knowledge graph construction. Although existing methods
achieve considerable success in generating realistic graphs, their
interpretability remains limited, often obscuring the rationale behind
structural decisions. To address this challenge, we propose the Neural Graph
Topic Model (NGTM), a novel generative framework inspired by topic modeling in
natural language processing. NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent
topics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful
substructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and
global scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic
distributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic
tracing of each generated graph. Experiments demonstrate that NGTM achieves
competitive generation quality while uniquely enabling fine-grained control and
interpretability, allowing users to tune structural features or induce
biological properties through topic-level adjustments.

Abstract: Current expressive speech synthesis models are constrained by the limited

comprehensive pipeline that integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), NV
tagging, emotion classification, and a fusion algorithm to merge transcriptions
from multiple annotators. Fine-tuning open-source text-to-speech (TTS) models
on the NVTTS dataset achieves parity with closed-source systems such as
CosyVoice2, as measured by both human evaluation and automatic metrics,
including speaker similarity and NV fidelity. By releasing NVTTS and its
accompanying annotation guidelines, we address a key bottleneck in expressive

Abstract: The effect of representation has been demonstrated in reinforcement learning,
from both theoretical and empirical successes. However, the existing
representation learning mainly induced from model learning aspects, misaligning
with our RL tasks. This work introduces Spectral Bellman Representation, a
novel framework derived from the Inherent Bellman Error (IBE) condition, which
aligns with the fundamental structure of Bellman updates across a space of
possible value functions, therefore, directly towards value-based RL. Our key
insight is the discovery of a fundamental spectral relationship: under the
zero-IBE condition, the transformation of a distribution of value functions by
the Bellman operator is intrinsically linked to the feature covariance
structure. This spectral connection yields a new, theoretically-grounded
objective for learning state-action features that inherently capture this
Bellman-aligned covariance. Our method requires a simple modification to
existing algorithms. We demonstrate that our learned representations enable
structured exploration, by aligning feature covariance with Bellman dynamics,
and improve overall performance, particularly in challenging hard-exploration
and long-horizon credit assignment tasks. Our framework naturally extends to
powerful multi-step Bellman operators, further broadening its impact. Spectral
Bellman Representation offers a principled and effective path toward learning
more powerful and structurally sound representations for value-based
reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Monotone gradient functions play a central role in solving the Monge
formulation of the optimal transport problem, which arises in modern
applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robot swarm control. When the
transport cost is the squared Euclidean distance, Brenier's theorem guarantees
that the unique optimal map is the gradient of a convex function, namely a
monotone gradient map, and it satisfies a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In

(mGradNets), neural networks that directly parameterize the space of monotone
gradient maps. In this work, we leverage mGradNets to directly learn the
optimal transport mapping by minimizing a training loss function defined using
the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We empirically show that the structural bias of
mGradNets facilitates the learning of optimal transport maps and employ our
method for a robot swarm control problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了MoTM模型，通过结合多个独立训练的隐式神经表示（INRs）和岭回归方法，来应对跨域时间序列插值问题，为时间序列插值的基础模型研究提供了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于时间序列的预测任务，而跨域缺失值填充任务较少被关注。本研究旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 基于隐式神经表示（INRs）建立MoTM模型，将多种特定时间序列模式的INRs和岭回归器结合，用于适应新的时间序列观察数据。

Result: MoTM模型在多种插值场景（如块状和点状缺失、不同采样率）下表现出了较强的域内和跨域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoTM为时间序列插值基础模型的研究带来了适应性强的解决方案，有望推动相关应用的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.

*Maria Margarida Mascarenhas,Jilles De Blauwe,Mikael Amelin,Hussain Kazmi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了是否使用提前发布的价格数据提升较晚市场的预测精度，并使用先进的模型预测，提高了比利时和瑞典市场的准确率分别为22%和9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索异步发布时间点的市场价格数据能否提升电价短期预测的准确性，以优化互联能源市场中的竞标策略。

Method: 使用先进的模型集合引入其他提前公布价格数据的互联市场(如德国-卢森堡、奥地利和瑞士)进行电价预测，并进行模型可解释性分析。

Result: 预测准确率在比利时提高22%，瑞典提高9%。频繁模型重校准可以提升准确性，但计算代价高；更多市场数据并不总是提升性能。

Conclusion: 异步价格数据对于优化电价预测有显著帮助，研究提供了为决策者和市场参与者在波动的欧洲市场中优化竞价战略的指导。

Abstract: Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for
strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While
data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high
forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input
covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published
prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones
can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a
state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%
and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)
respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with
earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement
holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also
yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary
for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,
and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a
fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast
models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market
participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within
increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.

### [205] [Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13263)
*Zikai Xie,Linjiang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于排序算法的新框架来构建排列空间上的核函数，重点介绍了"合并核(Merge Kernel)"，其复杂度由二次降为线性对数，同时保留有效的排列距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mall​​ows核需要$\Omega(n^2)$的复杂度来显式枚举每个成对比较，效率较低。本研究希望通过改进核的结构，提升贝叶斯优化在排列空间的效率。

Method: 基于排序算法设计了新框架，其中Mall​​ows核被视为由冒泡排序推导而来；提出新的Merge Kernel，这是由归并排序构成的，复杂度降低为$\Theta(n \log n)$。此外结合了三个轻量的任务无关描述符，以增强鲁棒性和紧凑性：位移直方图、分组线和滑动窗口模式。

Result: 实证结果表明，提出的Merge Kernel在多种排列优化基准测试中均优于最先进的Mallows核，提供了更紧凑且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: Merge Kernel显著降低了复杂度，同时保留了固有的排列信息，且在实际优化任务中表现优异，验证了其在排列空间贝叶斯优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box
optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation
spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that
explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close
relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a
novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on
sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as
a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the
\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic
complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.
The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in
linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation
distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing
compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic
descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element
displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,
which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the
two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which
summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation
optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more
compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation
space.

*Vincenzo Marco De Luca,Giovanna Varni,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TRENN的新型架构，该架构通过整合时间序列和关系动态来改进团队建模，并扩展为MT-TRENN以实现多任务预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 团队建模在AI与社会科学交叉领域面临挑战，需兼顾动态与关系，且要求模型具可解释性、能同时推断多个团队指标并提供优化建议。

Method: 提出TRENN架构，包括时间图提取器、时间关系编码器、解码器及两种可解释性模块，支持对团队动态的联合建模，并扩展为MT-TRENN，通过共享社交嵌入与多任务头同时预测多种团队指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著优于仅依赖时间或关系信息的方法，解释功能也提供了可操作的改进建议。

Conclusion: TRENN及其扩展的MT-TRENN是面向人类中心AI应用的有效工具，尤其适用于高风险协作环境中的智能决策支持系统。

Abstract: Team modeling remains a fundamental challenge at the intersection of
Artificial Intelligence and the Social Sciences. Social Science research
emphasizes the need to jointly model dynamics and relations, while practical
applications demand unified models capable of inferring multiple team
constructs simultaneously, providing interpretable insights and actionable
recommendations to enhance team performance. However, existing works do not
meet these practical demands. To bridge this gap, we present TRENN, a novel
tempo-relational architecture that integrates: (i) an automatic temporal graph
extractor, (ii) a tempo-relational encoder, (iii) a decoder for team construct
prediction, and (iv) two complementary explainability modules. TRENN jointly
captures relational and temporal team dynamics, providing a solid foundation
for MT-TRENN, which extends TReNN by replacing the decoder with a multi-task
head, enabling the model to learn shared Social Embeddings and simultaneously
predict multiple team constructs, including Emergent Leadership, Leadership
Style, and Teamwork components. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms approaches that rely exclusively on temporal
or relational information. Additionally, experimental evaluation has shown that
the explainability modules integrated in MT-TRENN yield interpretable insights
and actionable suggestions to support team improvement. These capabilities make
our approach particularly well-suited for Human-Centered AI applications, such
as intelligent decision-support systems in high-stakes collaborative
environments.

TL;DR: 提出GeoReg，一个回归模型，将卫星图像和基于网络的地理空间信息相结合，用于估计经济和社会指标，特别是数据稀缺地区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可获得数据有限，尤其是发展中国家，急需准确的社会经济指标估算方法支持政策制定和可持续发展。

Method: 通过融合卫星影像和地理空间信息，并利用大语言模型(LLM)作为数据工程师提取特征，结合线性回归器和非线性特征交互建模实现指标估算。

Result: 实验表明，GeoReg模型在数据有限的低收入国家也能优于现有基准方法，准确估算社会经济指标。

Conclusion: GeoReg有助于在数据稀缺情况下精确地估算社会经济指标，为政策制定提供支持，实现可持续发展。

Abstract: Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education
levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable
development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates
diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial
information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as
developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large
language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM
functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable
effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains
contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,
categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.
These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight
constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also
identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with
nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different
stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in
estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with
limited data availability.

*Laker Newhouse,R. Preston Hess,Franz Cesista,Andrii Zahorodnii,Jeremy Bernstein,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种在训练过程中保持Lipschitz约束的新方法，并成功应用于transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经网络对输入和权重扰动非常敏感，这会导致对抗样本脆弱性、训练发散和过拟合等问题。研究者希望通过Lipschitz约束解决这些问题，但在现代架构如transformer上的应用尚不成熟。

Method: 提出了计算高效的工具用于保持权重矩阵的规范约束，并将其应用于保持在训练过程中具有Lipschitz界的transformers。并通过更改优化器和设计权重约束方法来提升性能和Lipschitz界之间的权衡。

Result: 成功训练了多种Lipschitz约束transformer模型，其中小型模型达到了60%的验证准确率，大型模型达到21%。但是为接近常规模型的39.4%验证精度，Lipschitz界需提高至极高值。

Conclusion: 尽管结果表明实际表现和理论约束之间存在矛盾，该方法提供了一种不依赖稳定性机制训练transformer的新途径。

Abstract: Neural networks are often highly sensitive to input and weight perturbations.
This sensitivity has been linked to pathologies such as vulnerability to
adversarial examples, divergent training, and overfitting. To combat these
problems, past research has looked at building neural networks entirely from
Lipschitz components. However, these techniques have not matured to the point
where researchers have trained a modern architecture such as a transformer with
a Lipschitz certificate enforced beyond initialization. To explore this gap, we
begin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for
maintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able
to train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.
We find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves
standard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models
to reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's
update having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method
that improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter
transformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches
validation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz
transformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text. However, to match the
NanoGPT baseline validation accuracy of 39.4%, our Lipschitz upper bound
increases to 10^264. Nonetheless, our Lipschitz transformers train without
stability measures such as layer norm, QK norm, and logit tanh softcapping.

Abstract: Image classification currently faces significant security challenges due to
adversarial attacks, which consist of intentional alterations designed to
deceive classification models based on artificial intelligence. This article
explores an approach to generate adversarial attacks against image classifiers
using a combination of evolutionary algorithms and generative adversarial
networks. The proposed approach explores the latent space of a generative
adversarial network with an evolutionary algorithm to find vectors representing
adversarial attacks. The approach was evaluated in two case studies
corresponding to the classification of handwritten digits and object images.
The results showed success rates of up to 35% for handwritten digits, and up to
75% for object images, improving over other search methods and reported results
in related works. The applied method proved to be effective in handling data
diversity on the target datasets, even in problem instances that presented
additional challenges due to the complexity and richness of information.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful generative models but
remain challenging to train due to pathologies suchas mode collapse and
instability. Recent research has explored co-evolutionary approaches, in which
populations of generators and discriminators are evolved, as a promising
solution. This paper presents an empirical analysis of different coevolutionary
GAN training strategies, focusing on the impact of selection and replacement
mechanisms. We compare (mu,lambda), (mu+lambda) with elitism, and (mu+lambda)
with tournament selection coevolutionary schemes, along with a non-evolutionary
population based multi-generator multi-discriminator GAN baseline, across both
synthetic low-dimensional datasets (blob and gaussian mixtures) and an
image-based benchmark (MNIST). Results show that full generational replacement,
i.e., (mu,lambda), consistently outperforms in terms of both sample quality and
diversity, particularly when combined with larger offspring sizes. In contrast,
elitist approaches tend to converge prematurely and suffer from reduced
diversity. These findings highlight the importance of balancing exploration and
exploitation dynamics in coevolutionary GAN training and provide guidance for
designing more effective population-based generative models.
