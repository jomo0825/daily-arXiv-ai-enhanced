*Andreas Spilz,Heiko Oppel,Jochen Werner,Kathrin Stucke-Straub,Felix Capanni,Michael Munz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个多模态数据集，包含物理治疗动作及步态相关数据，用以支持机器学习模型开发和人体运动分析研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于传感器的分类模型开发需要大量多样化的数据集，但数据采集成本高昂且耗时，本文旨在提供一个多模态数据集作为研究资源。

Method: 从19名参与者处采集数据，结合IMU传感器和基于光学标记的动作捕捉系统，涵盖了正常及异常动作与步态，并提供详细注释和运动质量分析工具。

Result: 数据集包含IMU与MoCap系统的原始数据、IMU姿态处理结果、配准代码，支持各种机器学习任务，比如自动动作评估及步态分析等。

Conclusion: 所提数据集与相关工具将加速机器学习驱动的人体运动分析领域的研究进步。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [2] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BF-PIP的新方法，用零样本学习从视频片段预测行人意图，并比GPT-4V基线性能高18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有行人意图预测方法对监督学习和大量重新训练的依赖问题，特别是在复杂城市环境中的应用。

Method: 利用基于Gemini 2.5 Pro的零样本方法，整合连续视频片段和JAAD元数据，结合边界框注释和车辆速度，通过多模态提示进行预测。

Result: BF-PIP在预测精度上达到73%，比基于GPT-4V的方法高出18%，显示了对复杂空间时间感知能力的改进。

Conclusion: BF-PIP证明了结合时间视频输入和上下文线索的有效性，为智能交通系统的无训练感知模块提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [3] [ChartM$^3$: Benchmarking Chart Editing with Multimodal Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21167)
*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态图表编辑方法，通过自然语言和视觉指示结合来明确修改目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于依赖自然语言指令，难以支持细粒度编辑，因此引入一种多模态方法以更好表达用户意图。

Method: 设计了一个包含1000个样本的新基准Chart M3，并提供多层次复杂性和多视角评估的训练集及项目代码。同时，创建了包含24000个样本的Chart M3-Train，用于改进模型能力。

Result: 当前多模态大语言模型在解析与操作视觉指示方面表现有限，但通过Chart M3-Train进行微调后获得显著提升。

Conclusion: 整合自然语言和视觉指示的多模态编辑方法能够显著增强图表编辑能力，有助于开发更实用的系统。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

### [4] [PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200)
*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 此论文提出了一种生成对抗网络（GAN）用于合成牙科全景X光图像，以解决牙科研究和教育中的数据稀缺问题，并评估了图像的解剖学可见性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题，并探索GAN在牙科影像领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用了基于深度卷积GAN（DCGAN）和Wasserstein损失函数（包括梯度惩罚）的模型，处理了2322幅X光图像数据，研究了四种不同模型配置，涉及批评项迭代次数、特征深度和去噪前处理。

Result: 模型生成的图像在解剖细节和图像清晰度上有一定的权衡：未去噪数据生成的图像在细节上表现较好，去噪数据生成的图像整体清晰度更高。

Conclusion: 结果为牙科影像领域基于GAN的研究提供了基础。研究强调不同模型配置及数据预处理对生成图像质量的显著影响，并为后续优化提供了方向。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [5] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLN）的新型解释框架，用于分析如何生成图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在多模态任务中表现优越，但解释这些模型如何整合视觉、语言和知识信息生成有意义的描述仍是一个难题。

Method: 利用HMLN，通过学习训练数据分布并结合生成样本的分布偏移量，量化哪些训练实例对生成描述提供了有用信息。

Result: 实验证明了该框架在解释性方面的有效性，并能够对多种描述生成模型进行解释性比较。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种能够解释多模态任务生成过程的工具，为深度学习模型的透明性研究创造了新可能性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

### [6] [Dual Guidance Semi-Supervised Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21247)
*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于时空动作定位的半监督学习方法，通过双重指导网络实现更优的伪边界框选择，在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习在动作定位领域应用研究不足的问题，利用有限的标注数据提升模型性能。

Method: 提出双重指导网络结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和边界框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA等数据集上，模型在有限标注数据情况下表现显著提升，优于扩展的基于图像的半监督方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架证明了在有限标注数据场景下用于时空动作定位的可行性及优越性，为相关领域的研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

### [7] [Tracking Moose using Aerial Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21256)
*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究专注于通过数据集的patching增强方法改善小目标检测的性能，特别针对无人机野生生物追踪任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 出于保护目的，需要高效地在空中追踪地面小型目标，但目前有人机昂贵且风险高，而无人机处理能力受限，因此需要改进小目标检测方法。

Method: 通过数据集patching增强，对三种常见的目标检测模型在不同超参数配置下进行比较研究，并进行检测精度和统计分析。

Result: 采用不同参数配置后，所有模型在mAP@IoU=0.5表现均达到至少93%，研究表明简单快速的模型与复杂模型性能相当，并具有计算效率优势。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在有限的patchscale下，简单高效的模型对无人机任务具有实用性，模型和数据集也将公布以供进一步研究。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [8] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视图图像生成高质量HDR环境图，改进传统ERP格式中的畸变和接缝问题，并在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成HDR环境图时存在ERP格式的极点畸变与接缝 artefact 问题，且生成的环境图在质量和真实感上仍存在提升空间。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型（LDM），引入ERP卷积填充技术，设计了一种全景适配的Diffusion Transformer网络（PanoDiT），以降低ERP格式的畸变和artefact问题。

Result: 提出的PanoDiT网络尽管牺牲了一部分图像质量和真实感，但显著减少了畸变与artefact问题。在图像质量和光照准确性方面，与现有顶尖方法具有竞争力表现。

Conclusion: 通过引入PanoDiT网络和ERP卷积填充，优化了从单视角图像生成高质量HDR环境图的方法，为灯光渲染中的高质量图像生成提供了改进方案。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

### [9] [Fairness and Robustness of CLIP-Based Models for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21291)
*Théo Sourget,David Restrepo,Céline Hudelot,Enzo Ferrante,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了基于CLIP模型在胸部X光影像中的分类性能，并研究了其公平性和鲁棒性，发现其在不同的年龄段之间存在性能差距，也存在对非关键特征的依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在探讨基于CLIP模型在医疗影像任务（特别是胸部X光影像分类）中的公平性和鲁棒性问题，由于现有的研究多集中于模型精度，而对此领域的研究较少。

Method: 使用MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14和NEATX三个公开数据集，对六个现有的CLIP模型在胸部X光影像分类中的表现进行评估，分析其针对年龄、性别和种族的公平性，以及在带有和不带有胸腔引流管病例上的鲁棒性，并通过嵌入表示研究模型特征。

Result: 结果显示：不同年龄组的性能存在显著差异，而性别和种族的结果较为平等。此外，模型在不带胸腔引流管的影像上表现较差，表明存在对伪相关性的依赖性。嵌入分析显示可以分类敏感属性，但未能通过PCA发现明显模式。

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光任务上在一定程度上表现出公平性，但仍存在性能偏差和鲁棒性问题，需进一步改进以减少对伪相关性和敏感属性的依赖。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

### [10] [VoluMe -- Authentic 3D Video Calls from Live Gaussian Splat Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21311)
*Martin de La Gorce,Charlie Hewitt,Tibor Takacs,Robert Gerdisch,Zafiirah Hosenie,Givi Meishvili,Marek Kowalski,Thomas J. Cashman,Antonio Criminisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从单一2D摄像头实时预测逼真3D高斯重建的方法，用于三维在线会议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟3D会议比传统的2D视频通话更有潜力提升参与感和互动效果。但现有3D人物表现方法存在硬件复杂、固定外观等限制。

Method: 通过一个新方法从2D摄像头实时生成真实时3D重建，利用帧独立条件并引入稳定性损失，确保真实性和稳定性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视觉质量和稳定性上达到了当前最佳效果，并支持仅使用标准设备的实时3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了兼具高可访问性、真实性和实时性的3D视频会议，使任何人都能轻松体验体积式沟通。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

### [11] [GLCP: Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation for Tubular Structure Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21328)
*Feixiang Zhou,Zhuangzhi Gao,He Zhao,Jianyang Xie,Yanda Meng,Yitian Zhao,Gregory Y. H. Lip,Yalin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP)的新型框架，用于精准分割管状结构（如血管网络），重点解决了现有方法中局部结构不连续的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割方法虽然注重全局拓扑结构，但对局部不连续区域关注不足，导致分割效果不佳。因此，该研究旨在解决管状结构中分割的局部不连续性问题，同时保持全局结构完整性。

Method: 本文提出了一个全局到局部的连接保持框架（GLCP）：包括① 交互式多头分割（IMS）模块，用于联合学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图；② 基于双注意力的精化（DAR）模块，用于优化分割图质量。

Result: 通过在2D和3D数据集上的广泛实验，GLCP框架在准确性和连续性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过全球与局部的协同处理显著提高了管状结构分割的性能，并有助于下游任务的开展，源码已开放。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

TL;DR: 研究通过格赖斯的对话合作原则，探讨视图语言模型（VLMs）对修饰性问题敏感性的分析，发现其在面对此类修饰时性能会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过对比格赖斯对话原则下的人类与VLMs的反应，研究VLMs在复杂语言情境中的表现及其缺陷。

Method: 向人类制作的问题中添加修饰词，分析三种先进VLMs（GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet 和 Gemini-1.5-Flash）对这些问题的反应，数据基于VQA v2.0。

Result: 实验发现，VLMs 在加入修饰词后性能持续下降，证明了研究方法可有效揭示其局限性。

Conclusion: 研究说明当前VLMs在处理复杂修辞和违反对话合作原则的问题时存在局限，表明探索其改进的可能性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Conclusion: 此方法在图像质量和时间效率上具有优势，更适合实时临床应用，且代码已公开，具有潜在的广泛应用价值。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

TL;DR: 作者提出了一个名为Collaborative Perceiver (CoP)的多任务学习框架，用于改进基于视觉的鸟瞰图3D目标检测，结合空间占有信息和局部特征提取方法，有效提升了目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在构建鸟瞰视角表示时往往忽略了环境中的固有上下文信息（如道路和人行道），这限制了检测器对真实物理世界的全面感知能力。

Method: 提出了一个多任务学习框架CoP，通过空间占用信息（辅助任务）和3D目标检测任务之间的一致特性提取共享的结构和概念相似性，具体包括生成密集空间占用数据的LDO方法、基于体素高度的细粒度局部特征提取VHS策略以及全局-局部协作的特征融合模块CFF。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上进行了广泛的实验，CoP框架在测试集上实现了49.5%的mAP和59.2%的NDS，比现有的基于视觉的方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间占用辅助任务和改进的特征提取方法，CoP有效增强了鸟瞰图表示的鲁棒性和目标检测性能。这表明利用多任务学习可以显著改进无人驾驶相关技术性能。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN

field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and

Motivation: 现有领域广义语义分割方法在未见环境中表现退化，难以捕捉潜在域先验信息。

Method: 提出PDAF框架，包含潜在先验提取器（LPE）、域补偿模块（DCM）及扩散先验估计器（DPE），通过模拟域转移及迭代建模提升特征表征的一致性。

Result: 实验证明PDAF在多种复杂城市场景中泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: PDAF通过概率扩散和域先验增强，有效缓解域转移对分割性能的影响。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该任务旨在应用于虚拟现实、室内设计、房地产和机器人领域，但由于缺乏显式的3D结构以及几何一致性和逼真感的需求，任务实现具有挑战性。

Method: Top2Pano方法通过估计体积占用推断3D结构，利用体积渲染生成初步的颜色和深度全景图，然后结合基于扩散的ControlNet优化阶段提升真实感和结构保真度。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的奖励模型LLaVA-Reward，用于多角度自动评估文本到图像生成任务（T2I）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需大量监督微调和分析文本响应，训练复杂且耗时。本研究旨在直接利用多模态语言模型的隐藏状态，提高评估效率。

Method: 提出LLaVA-Reward模型，结合SkipCA模块以改进视觉和文本表示的双向交互，支持paired和unpaired偏好数据进行高效微调。

Result: 实验表明，LLaVA-Reward在文本图像对齐、真实性、安全性及总体排名评估等四个方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward实现了更高的人类一致性评分和推断时间的扩展性能，有助于T2I任务的自动化评估。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的高效方法主要针对推理阶段窗口化训练成本，而本研究旨在解决MLLM训练中的计算成本问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，冻结的参考大语言模型作为教师，训练中的MLLM为学生，通过参考损失和学生的难度分数组合来适应性地选择和跳过令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE在减少41%以上总令牌量的同时达到相同的峰值准确性，并可在某些多模态基准上超越基线。

Conclusion: ReGATE显著提高了MLLM训练效率，在合理减少计算成本的同时保证或提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

TL;DR: MapDiffusion提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，学习可能地图的完整分布，提高了自动驾驶在线地图构建的性能和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型无法捕捉环境的不确定性和模糊性，如遮挡和车道线缺失。

Method: 使用扩散模型从Bird's-Eye View (BEV)潜在网格生成多个可能的地图样本，同时提供不确定性估计和更高的预测准确性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，MapDiffusion相比基线在单样本性能上提升了5%，且聚合多个样本进一步提高了性能。不确定性估计在遮挡区域尤其显著。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模地图的完整分布，提升了在线矢量高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，为自动驾驶的不确定性感知决策提供了支持。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC框架通过原型表示来建立一致的跨图像语义，为半监督医学图像分割提供了新思路，显著提高了分割精度，并解决了特征差异问题。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视觉语言导航（VLN）的导航策略，通过递归总结视觉感知并自适应地与命令对齐，以提升导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的VLN代理存在过于详细的场景表示和模糊的视觉-语言对齐问题，导致对导航友好的高级场景先验理解不足，从而频繁出现违反语言指令的行为。

Method: 通过将历史轨迹结构化为紧凑的神经网格，提出递归视觉构想（RVI）技术，促使代理专注于视觉过渡和场景布局的规律性，减少几何细节的干扰；提出自适应语言落地（ALG）技术，将情境记忆与不同的语言组件精细匹配，提升语义对齐能力。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上，该导航策略表现优于最先进方法，验证了RVI和ALG技术的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的RVI和ALG技术显著提升了视觉语言导航中的导航性能，展示了其对长序列导航决策的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过自监督数据蒸馏技术可以更紧凑且有效地保存原始数据集的关键信息，提升模型在多个场景中的适应性。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 当前开放集3D对象检索因缺乏充分的3D训练数据，导致表征能力较弱，研究的主要动机是利用CLIP模型的泛化特性提升任务效果。

Method: DAC框架融合CLIP与MLLM，其中CLIP生成泛化表示，MLLM提供类别描述和未知对象的额外信息，同时引入AB-LoRA技术减少过拟合并提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

### [30] [Suppressing Gradient Conflict for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21530)
*Ming-Hui Liu,Harry Cheng,Xin Luo,Xin-Shun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文针对深伪检测中的梯度冲突问题，提出了一个冲突抑制深伪检测框架（CS-DFD），以提高域内准确性和跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深伪检测方法在加入在线生成伪造图像的数据后，反而会导致性能下降，这与数据增加通常会提高精度的观点相矛盾。本文旨在分析并解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了CS-DFD框架，其中包括两部分：更新向量搜索（UVS）模块通过搜索替代更新向量解决原始图像与伪造图像的冲突；冲突梯度降低（CGR）模块通过引入冲突下降损失来减少梯度之间的对抗作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，CS-DFD在多种深伪检测基准中的域内检测精度和跨域泛化能力上都达到了最新水平。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过减轻梯度冲突问题，提高了深伪检测的整体性能，为在线合成伪造图像与原始数据的联合训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Result: 完成了对不同传感器配置的建模与校准方法的全面综述，识别了研究差距并提供了改进方向建议。

Conclusion: 文章统一整理了过去二十年太阳传感器的研究成果，为传感器模型和校准领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上取得了当前最优的性能。

Conclusion: 引入关系编码与语义专家路由的设计显著提升了在线高清地图构建的准确性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CNN网络规模及复杂性不断增加，难以在资源有限平台高效部署，需要寻找优化剪枝过程的方法。

Method: LinDeps使用枢轴QR分解分析卷积层特征图的线性相关性，并移除冗余滤波器，同时提出信号恢复机制调整下一层内核以避免性能损耗。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上测试表明，与现有剪枝技术结合，LinDeps提高压缩率，保留性能，且在低资源环境中显著提升剪枝效果和推理速度。

Conclusion: LinDeps能够作为现有或未来剪枝技术的有效附加组件，提高CNN的剪枝效率并降低资源需求。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS通过一种动态调整的偏好策略，改进了现有的方法，减少了多模态推理中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态语言模型输出中常见的幻觉问题，这些问题导致了输出内容的不准确性以及缺乏基础视觉信息的支持。

Method: 提出一种名为TARS的代币自适应偏好策略，通过将直接偏好优化改进为一个最小-最大优化问题，以在语义约束下最大化代币分布的变化，并同时最小化偏好损失。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，TARS表现出色，仅使用4800个偏好样本和无专家反馈的情况下，将幻觉率降低到13.2%（相比原26.4%），并在多个指标上超越标准DPO，与GPT-4o表现相当。

Conclusion: TARS策略在保持因果基础的同时，减少了对偏好模式的过拟合，有效降低了多模态推理中的幻觉问题并提升了可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Conclusion: 为熟悉弱监督语义分割概念的研究人员提供了一份最新的全面综述，以加深对领域内先进技术及方法论创新的理解。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了面部老化模拟的控制性和真实性，适应性更强，有助于实现个性化的老化生成。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Method: 提出了一个解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位与局部时间关联，同时引入实例对比损失从多视角学习实例对应。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，与现有自监督跟踪方法相比，{	racker}在GOT10K、LaSOT、TrackingNet数据集的AUC (AO)得分分别提升了25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: {	racker}在无需框注释的情况下，展示出了高效的通用跟踪表现，减少了对大量人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Result: 发现在分割边界微弱和低对比场景下，简单的DeepLabv3模型表现优于更复杂的模型。

Conclusion: 针对特定领域的医学分割应用，经过精调的简单模型同样有高效性和可靠可靠性，应重新评估大型通用模型始终优越的假设，并开放了小数据集处理和领域编码的实现方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Conclusion: EMIT框架展示了通过难度感知的优化策略和多模态处理技术增强多模态大语言模型在工业异常检测中表现的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估中优于现有的上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint框架在无需重新训练的基础上，提升了掩模区域内的语义一致性和视觉真实感，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors
or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent
surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the
continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD

LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms
empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对南极海底生物多样性监测的目标检测框架，并发布了Weddell海的第一个公共计算机视觉数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究意图是为了解气候驱动的生态变化，通过抗衡手工注释图像的繁琐性，开发自动化的生物多样性分析方法。

Method: 通过结合保持分辨率的拼接、空间数据增强、模型微调以及Slicing Aided Hyper Inference后处理，开发针对高分辨率拖曳相机图像的目标检测框架，并对多种目标检测架构进行基准测试。

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

### [45] [APT: Improving Diffusion Models for High Resolution Image Generation with Adaptive Path Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690)
*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架Adaptive Path Tracing (APT)，用于解决基于patch方法生成高分辨率图像时的分布偏移和单调性问题，并提升了图像生成质量与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Latent Diffusion Models在高分辨率场景下有限制，且训练方法需要大量数据和计算资源，现有的基于patch的方法存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出Adaptive Path Tracing (APT)框架，结合了统计匹配（Statistical Matching）和尺度感知调度（Scale-aware Scheduling）来解决问题，并简化了降噪过程。

Result: APT生成了更清晰且细节丰富的高分辨率图像，并提升了推理速度的同时保持了图像质量。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种实用且高效的方法，解决了现有方法的两大核心问题，提高了图像清晰度和生成效率。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

*Yuan Tian,Shuo Wang,Rongzhao Zhang,Zijian Chen,Yankai Jiang,Chunyi Li,Xiangyang Zhu,Fang Yan,Qiang Hu,XiaoSong Wang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分而治之框架，用于在保护隐私的同时保留医学图像的语义信息，展现出在七个数据集和三个下游任务上的先进表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像去身份化技术存在无法充分保留医学语义或缺乏隐私等级灵活调整的问题。

Method: 提出了一个分两步的框架：1）身份屏蔽，屏蔽不同比例的身份相关区域以实现不同隐私等级；2）医学语义补偿，利用预训练的医学基础模型提取语义特征并补偿被屏蔽的区域。此外，还采用最小描述长度原则进行特征解耦，去除残留的身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务上的实验证明了其优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和医学语义信息保留之间实现了良好的平衡，并在多个任务中展示了优异的性能。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文分析了三种前沿检测Transformer模型的关键组件，通过系统性消融实验评估其对模型性能的影响，并公开了DeepDissect工具库以促进复现和进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过揭示检测Transformer内部组件的具体功能，改进模型的透明性和效率，填补目前关于复杂模型解读性研究的空白。

Method: 采用神经科学中消融研究的启发，系统性消融DETR、DDETR和DINO模型中的关键组件，包括查询嵌入、编码器和解码器的多头自注意力以及解码器的多头交叉注意力。同时通过COCO数据集评估环节的gIoU和F1评分。

Result: 研究发现模型对消融的敏感性具有特性：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA特别敏感，而DDETR抗干扰能力较强，DINO则展现出最强的鲁棒性，同时揭示了部分解码器结构中存在的冗余。

Conclusion: 该研究通过揭示检测Transformer中内部组件对性能的贡献，推动了XAI领域的发展，并在优化模型透明性和效率方向上提供了启示。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

*Qianxiong Xu,Lanyun Zhu,Chenxi Liu,Guosheng Lin,Cheng Long,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的视觉目标跟踪模型SAMITE，通过整合新的模块以提高跟踪精准性，应对遮挡与干扰并减少跟踪误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标跟踪方法忽略了时间依赖性或泛化性较差，且无法有效解决遮挡与干扰的问题，也缺乏阻断误差传播的机制。

Method: 基于SAM2模型，加入了两个新模块：（1）原型记忆库，通过衡量每帧追踪结果的特征和位置正确性，选取最佳帧进行后续帧条件推断；（2）位置提示生成器，生成位置遮罩提示，为目标位置提供显式线索。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验结果显示，SAMITE具有显著优势。

Conclusion: SAMITE通过改进的内存管理和位置提示机制，有效提高了目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在遮挡和干扰场景下。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAGE（Multimodal Alignment and Generation Enhancement）的框架，用于解决多模态学习中视觉数据编码后空间与语义损失的问题，并取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态学习中，视觉编码器和大语言模型的耦合程度显著影响性能，但现有方法存在信息传播中的向量间隙或语义差异等问题，导致信息损失，因此需要一种改进的方法。

Method: MAGE通过引入智能对齐网络（IAN），实现维度和语义的对齐，并结合交叉熵和均方误差的训练策略来减少异质数据的语义差距。同时，开发多模态工具调用指令的微调数据集以扩展模型输出能力。

Result: MAGE在多种评估基准（如MME、MMBench、SEED）上表现优于同类研究，展示了其在语义对齐以及通用性方面的显著提升。

Conclusion: MAGE框架成功解决了多模态模型的语义空间对齐问题，提供了一种高效的创新方法，其开源代码为进一步研究提供了支持。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别进行表征学习，然而引入的类别特定语义会影响模型对新类别的泛化能力。

Method: 提出AdvRF框架，将细粒度图像检索任务重构为视觉差异重构任务，将检索模型的类别感知差异定位能力和重构模型的类别无关特征学习能力相结合，通过知识蒸馏实现模型高效部署。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上都取得了不错的定量和定性结果。

Conclusion: AdvRF框架能够学习类别无关的差异表示，提升细粒度图像检索任务的泛化能力，并在多个数据集上表现良好，证明其有效性。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和视觉-语言模型虽具有强大的推理能力，但在注释数据匮乏和昂贵的专业领域（如遥感）中并不实用，因此需要开发一种更高效的数据利用方法。

Method: 作者将"1-shot RLVR"范式从语言模型应用于视觉-语言模型中，采用基于策略梯度的优化方法，仅需一个精心设计的样本，即可对模型输出在卫星遥感任务中进行对齐。

Result: 实验证明，即使只使用单一示例，模型在分类、视觉问答和目标定位等多个遥感基准上均取得显著提升，并且扩展到128个示例的性能可与使用数千个标注样本的模型媲美。

Conclusion: 本文方法在各类任务中展现了稳健的泛化能力和数据效率，为数据稀缺领域提供了一种具有成本效益的视觉-语言推理模型开发方案，且进一步证明任务的提示设计和权重设置对最终性能具有显著影响。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备上的实时疲劳检测系统提供了一种精准且高效的解决方案，能够提高交通安全。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的视觉Transformer存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了MoR-ViT框架，通过引入基于Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) 的动态递归机制，使每个token能够自适应地决定其处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和转移基准上，MoR-ViT在减少最多70%的参数、加速推理2.5倍的同时实现了当前最先进的准确性，并超越了诸如DynamicViT和TinyViT等高效ViT基线。

Conclusion: 动态递归是一种有效的高效视觉Transformer策略，为现实场景中的深度学习模型提供了新的扩展和应用方向。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MSGCoOp的框架，通过多语义指导的上下文优化方法，提升了小样本领域的新类泛化能力，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言预训练模型在泛化到新类时表现不佳，主要因为对已见类别过拟合及遗忘通用知识。此外，改进泛化性能的方法通常需引入复杂结构或增加计算开销。

Method: 提出MSGCoOp框架，利用多语义指导的方法，用并行的可学习上下文向量捕获多样语义，辅以大语言模型自动生成的类别描述；同时采用多样性正则化损失避免上下文表示的冗余化。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上表现优越，相较于强基线KgCoOp，平均谐波均值提升1.10%，并在跨领域任务中展现更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MSGCoOp框架在平衡效率和泛化性能上表现优异，可显著提高小样本视觉-语言任务的新类泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有模型在医学数据变异性和歧义性面前表现不佳的问题，提高对临床信息和不确定性的理解。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成结构化文本报告，包括疾病定义、关键区域说明、观察和诊断结果，结合影像数据进行联合建模，模拟模态内和模态间不确定性。

Result: 模型在多项下游任务中表现优异，取得了最新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的医学图像-文本预训练模型能有效捕捉医疗影像和文本中的模糊信息，从而提升数据表征和任务表现。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0成功结合了多种优势，为生成沉浸式、可探索和交互性的3D世界提供了新的技术框架，并拓展了虚拟现实和内容创作的可能性。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Motivation: 研究未专业背景用户如何利用简单的提示词绕过LLMs和T2I系统的安全机制。

Method: 提出了提示级别的jailbreaks策略分类法，并通过案例研究揭示了从输入过滤到输出验证各阶段可被绕过的策略。

Result: 分析表明，jailbreaks可以轻松绕过主流模型的安全机制。

Conclusion: 紧急需要开发基于上下文感知的防御机制，以应对现实世界中jailbreaks的普遍性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过减少冗余的架构专属信息来进行知识转移，避免了复杂模块和过多参数的引入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在效率低、不适用等问题，作者希望找到一种更简单、通用的跨架构知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏(RSD)损失，包括跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计了轻量化模块以保留学生模型的架构专属能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准上优于OFA，且参数开销仅为OFA的一小部分。

Conclusion: RSD方法是一种简单但强大的跨架构知识蒸馏基准，在没有架构特定设计的情况下，具有较高的效率和适用性。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型的选择性跨模态融合框架SMFNet，用于改进RGB-D视频显著性目标检测，通过对RGB、深度信息和光流进行最优融合，大幅提升了性能，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型未能充分利用光流和深度信息的不同比重来提升RGB模态，从而限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架(SMFNet)，包括像素级选择性融合策略(PSF)和多维选择性注意模块(MSAM)，以最优方式融合光流与深度信息，再与RGB内容结合增强特征表示。

Result: SMFNet在多个RGB-D VSOD数据集上进行测试，较19个最新模型表现出色，并在含合成深度信息的视频数据集上验证了其高效性。

Conclusion: SMFNet充分利用光流和深度信息的不同比重优化RGB-D视频显著性目标检测，其代码和结果公开，为RGB-D VSOD领域提供了一个性能全面提升的基准方法。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Motivation: 解决现有视频编辑方法中由于复杂运动模式难以捕捉而导致的时间不一致性，以及UNet框架限制带来的过度拟合问题。

Method: 提出Vid-TTA框架，以自监督辅助任务对每段测试视频进行个性化优化，引入运动感知帧重建和提示扰动与重建策略，同时采用元学习驱动的动态损失平衡机制调整优化过程。

Result: 实验表明，Vid-TTA显著改善视频时间一致性，减轻提示过拟合，同时不增加计算开销，能作为现有视频编辑模型的性能增强模块。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA提供了一种高效的轻量级视频编辑改进方案，兼顾了质量、鲁棒性和资源消耗。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效利用视觉线索解决多模态理解的歧义，且单一线条假设表现不佳。

Method: 提出结合头指尖与腕指尖方向的双模型框架，并利用高斯射线热图增强指向性信息，同时加入CLIP特征的混合集成模块和对象中心预测头作为辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt基准数据集上性能提高4 mAP（0.25 IoU阈值）。

Conclusion: 方法改进了多模态场景中目标对象的定位精确度，为理解场景中复杂指向提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Motivation: 解决传统顺序文本到视觉流程的局限性，实现叙事与多模态生成的深度融合和一致性。

Result: 在各种题材的叙事生成任务中，表现出叙事深度、视觉质量和情感共鸣显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Aether Weaver为快速创意原型构建和沉浸式叙事体验提供了一个强大的平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Motivation: 现有视网膜影像分析模型存在对小病灶区域和疾病间细微差异表现不佳的问题，容易导致预测准确度低和模型过拟合。

Method: 开发了SwinECAT模型，将Swin Transformer中移位窗口注意力与高效通道注意力（ECA）机制相结合，通过有效捕获局部结构与长程依赖以及聚焦关键特征通道来提高特征表征能力。

Result: 在含16,140张图像的9类别EDID数据集上实验，SwinECAT的分类准确率为88.29%，权重F1得分为0.88，宏F1得分为0.90，显著优于Swin Transformer和基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT显著提升了视网膜影像分类的表现，突破了9类别公共数据集分类的最佳记录，表明该方法在医疗影像分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Motivation: 当前多模态领域缺乏大规模、高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据生成方法构建数据集：1) 收集公开的多模态问答数据；2) 利用GPT-4o生成推理过程，整合API调用和RAG信息；3) 通过反思性校准提升逻辑一致性和准确性；4) 优化为单回合形式以提升效率。

Result: 通过fine-tune，InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在八个公共基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在RAG基准Dyn-VQA中提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M显著提高了多模态模型的推理及工具使用能力，对多模态领域发展有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为LMAC-Net的模型，解决了现有方法无法有效捕捉多模态交互和长序列动态变化的问题，在艺术运动质量评估任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在多模态信息建模和长时间序列动态捕捉上有诸多不足，难以满足艺术类运动质量评估的需求。

Method: 提出了一种名为LMAC-Net的网络，采用多模态注意力一致性机制对视觉和音频信息进行有效融合，引入局部查询编码模块捕捉时序语义与跨模态关系，并使用双重评分机制提升结果解释性。

Result: LMAC-Net在RG和Fis-V数据集上取得了显著优于现有方法的表现。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net改善了多模态对齐及长序列动态建模能力，对艺术运动评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MetaCLIP 2，通过从全球范围内的网页规模图像-文本对中训练CLIP模型，克服多语言模式的性能下降问题，并在多个基准测试中创下新纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升CLIP模型在全球范围数据中学习的能力，解决非英语数据的处理问题和多语言模式性能下降的挑战。

Method: 通过系统化的对比实验以及必要的改进，提出了一种新的训练CLIP的路径MetaCLIP 2，该方法能有效利用英语与非英语数据的互补性。

Result: MetaCLIP 2在零样本ImageNet分类中超越了英语单一版本0.8%，并在CVQA、Babel-ImageNet和XM3600等多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2提供了一种新的训练配方，使来自英语与非英语世界的数据能够共同提升表现，从而克服了多语言模式的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

*Jiwoong Park,Chaeun Lee,Yongseok Choi,Sein Park,Deokki Hong,Jungwook Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mixup的文本提示策略以改进无数据量化（DFQ）在极低比特场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据量化方法在生成合成图片时存在多义性问题，导致模型泛化性差和性能下降。

Method: 引入Mixup-class prompt，即在文本提示层面融合多个类别标签，生成多样且鲁棒的合成数据，并通过梯度范数与泛化误差分析量化效果。

Result: 在CNN和ViT模型上超过现有最优DFQ方法如GenQ，特别是在2位权重4位激活（W2A4）量化极低比特场景中实现了新的性能水平。

Conclusion: Mixup-class prompt策略增强了合成数据多样性与优化稳定性，提高了量化模型的泛化能力，在极低比特量化场景中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴影去除依赖掩膜，但获取真实场景中的阴影掩膜困难；需要探索新的引导方法。

Result: 实验结果显示方法在无掩膜阴影去除领域达到目前最佳表现，同时在接近掩膜方法的基础上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文方法在复杂场景中有效消除阴影，同时处理软边界及细节，呈现强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

TL;DR: 该论文解决了弱监督语义分割（WSSS）中由于仅使用图像级标签训练模型而导致的监督鸿沟和偏差问题，提出了一种新框架提高分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在一些领域（如工业烟雾）中，很难获取像素级注释，导致分割任务面临挑战。因此亟需提升弱监督语义分割的性能。

Method: 作者提出了结合CNNs 和 ViTs 的教师-学生框架，通过知识迁移损失增强跨架构一致性，同时结合后处理技术提升伪掩模质量。

Result: 方法主要解决了弱监督分割中目标覆盖不完整、边界不准确以及空间共现问题，尤其适用于难以标注的烟雾分割领域。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖额外的先验知识，有效克服模型在上下文共现上的依赖，提升了弱监督语义分割的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于精准位姿信息，但该信息难以获取且易受噪声影响，限制了其实用性。

Method: 通过适配全景域的重建预训练并引入RoPE rolling，以最小修改方式建模全景图像的水平周期性并实现高效域转移。

Result: 在无位姿信息的情况下，PanoSplatt3R显著超越了当前的最先进方法，生成高质量新视图并实现更准确的深度估计。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了其在真实应用中的巨大潜力，成为一种高效的无位姿信息重建方法。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

Conclusion: 所提方法在分类心电图图像方面表现优异，具有在临床工作流程中作为自动化工具的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Result: EIFNet在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上实现了最新的领域性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet通过增强事件与图像数据的特征提取和融合能力，为事件语义分割任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Conclusion: ZIUM通过结合灵活的意图定制和高效的零次攻击方法，为对抗未学习模型提供了一种有效且快速的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在保护所有者的知识产权，通过为模型加入可识别的秘密行为（染色）以及限制使用条件（锁定）。

Method: 通过修改少量模型权重实现染色和锁定，且无需额外的模型微调，使用计算可证明的方式，保证最低的假阳性率。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个计算机视觉模型上表现良好，染色和锁定对模型性能的影响较小。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在保护模型的知识产权方面具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在视觉理解和多模态推理中表现卓越，但易出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与图像内容不一致。现有方法常以文本为中心，难以解决细粒度视觉理解场景的挑战。

Method: ViHallu通过可控视觉变更的视觉变体图像生成和视觉指令构造来增强视觉-语义对齐，同时结合视觉指令进行微调，提升模型对图像内容的细粒度理解。

Result: 实验证明ViHallu显著减少了模型的幻觉现象，并提高了细粒度的视觉内容理解能力，同时发布了专门用于幻觉缓解和视觉语义对齐的数据集ViHallu-Instruction。

Conclusion: ViHallu框架有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，增强了视觉-语义对齐能力，为细粒度视觉理解提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨音视频模型在低资源、多语言且噪声复杂环境中的性能，同时分析聚合函数对性能的影响。

Method: 使用来自多个印度语言和方言变体的多语言数据集，比较三种对比目标：全局平均池、密集最大平均匹配和一种简单混合方法，同时冻结视觉骨干网络。

Result: 密集目标比全局池在检索指标上有+59%的相对提升，并生成了更尖锐的零样本本地化热图。

Conclusion: 即使在低资源和嘈杂的多语言环境中，密集标记路由对检索和本地化性能仍然关键，并非高资源英语数据集的专属功能。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了导航基础模型的局限性，并提出了“Seeing-to-Experiencing (S2E)”框架，通过强化学习提升模型的交互性和适应能力。实验验证了强化学习相较于监督微调的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前导航基础模型基于离线数据训练，难以适应实际动态环境，尤其是在需要安全交互的城市导航中更显局限性。

Method: 提出Seeing-to-Experiencing (S2E)框架，通过结合视频预训练和仿真环境中的强化学习，增加模型的交互性。包括创新的Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching策略和Residual-Attention Module。并设计了综合评价基准NavBench-GS。

Result: 实验表明S2E框架缓解了离线数据扩展的收益递减问题，加强了模型的通用性和安全性。

Conclusion: 强化学习在机器人学习中比监督微调具有更大的潜力，有效集成在线交互经验是扩展基础模型的关键。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Motivation: 传统FGFSL偏爱深层网络，浅层网络因过多非抽象视觉特性提取而不被青睐，研究探讨浅层架构潜力。

Method: 引入LCN-4网络，集成位置感知特征聚类模块与通用网格位置编码补偿技术，以及频域位置嵌入技术。

Result: 实验在三个FGFSL基准上验证，LCN-4显著优于ConvNet-4为基础的最新方法，性能与部分ResNet12为基础的方法持平或更优。

Conclusion: 浅层网络能够通过创新设计实现与深层网络相媲美的性能，为FGFSL应用提供有效选项。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Motivation: 为推进空间AI，解决现有方法中不能直接将CLIP语义引入3D重建，缺乏全局一致的几何与语义对齐问题。

Method: 设计了CLIP3R模块，用于从视频剪辑预测点云并嵌入物体层次的语义；设计了2D-3D OVS模块，通过学习融合描述符将2D特征提升到3D，融入空间、几何和语义信息。

Result: 框架在密集3D重建和开放词汇3D分割任务中实现了当前最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Ov3R框架实现了实时、语义感知的空间AI能力，为3D重建与分割领域提供了重要推动。

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,
semantics-aware Spatial AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本图像识别技术存在显著应用前景，但与传统大规模图像识别仍有较大技术差距，需要创新性方法来提升识别性能。

Method: 提出了名为MetaLab的方法，由两个协作神经网络组成：LabNet用于CIELab颜色空间的领域转换和丰富特征提取，LabGNN则实现光亮图与颜色图之间的互相学习。

Result: 该方法在四个粗粒度、四个精细粒度及四个跨域少样本基准上表现出高精度、强鲁棒性与有效泛化能力，单样本类别情况下接近99%的识别准确率。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的图像生成通过离散自回归建模存在视觉效果差、输出失真和难以处理复杂指令等问题。而这些问题可能源于自回归推断中的累积误差或离散化过程中信息的丢失。

Method: 使用强化学习改善离散自回归建模效果，提出由语义图像分词器、统一的语言和图像自回归模型以及离线扩散解码器组成的框架X-Omni。

Result: 实验表明，使用7B语言模型的X-Omni生成图像具有高审美质量，并能有效遵循指令和渲染复杂文本，在图像生成任务中达到最新性能。

Conclusion: 引入强化学习克服了离散自回归建模中的限制，验证了统一的图像和语言生成方法的可行性和优越性。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StepAL，一个专为长型手术视频设计的主动学习框架，能够提高手术步骤识别的效率并减少标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法难以满足手术步骤识别需求，因为其针对的是图像或短视频片段，不适用于有连续性和上下文需求的长手术视频。

Method: 引入StepAL框架，通过伪标签提取视频内手术步骤的分布特征，并结合熵加权的聚类策略，选择不确定且多样的完整视频进行标注。

Result: 在两组白内障手术数据集上，StepAL以更少的标注视频实现了更高的手术步骤识别准确率，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: StepAL框架显著降低了手术视频分析中的标注成本，同时提高了计算机辅助手术系统开发的效率。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的少样本视频对象分割数据集与方法主要集中于对象类别，而忽略了视频中丰富的时间动态性，这限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 该研究提出了一个名为MOVE的大规模数据库，用于运动驱动的少样本视频对象分割。同时，综合评估了来自3个不同相关任务的6种尖端方法，并提出了一种新的基线方法：解耦运动外观网络（DMA）。

Result: 实验结果表明当前方法在应对运动驱动的少样本视频对象分割方面存在困难，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MOVE数据集和DMA方法为运动理解方向的研究打下了坚实基础，并为解决相关挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: 本研究提出通过"AI Social Gym"实现动态教育对话，展示了混合型教学方法能够显著提高大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识获取和应用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI主要依赖独立探索（Piagetian模型），受限于数据集和稀疏反馈，难以有效学习复杂知识。因此，需要一种更有效的学习范式，借鉴侧重社会交互的Vygotsky理论。

Method: 创建了"AI Social Gym"动态环境，让AI学习者与知识丰富的AI教师进行双向教学对话，研究不同教学策略对本体获取的影响。

Result: 研究表明，以对话形式融合自上而下的解释与学习者提出的问题的教学策略，优于单向教学或直接访问结构化知识，显著提升了大型语言模型的知识学习能力。

Conclusion: 将教育学与心理学的洞见引入AI训练，不仅提高知识获取效率，也为当前的方法（如prompt engineering）提供了有力补充。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Method: 研究采用汇聚设计，通过屏幕录制和文稿分析，结合定性编码、描述性统计、时间序列分析和线性回归分析，研究学生编辑行为。

Result: 发现了两种编辑模式：一种学生反复改进开头，另一种则快速转向对主体内容的大量编辑。AI生成词数量能显著预测写作得分，但大多数编辑变量的影响有限。

Conclusion: AI文本书写支持有助于提升学生写作过程，但不能替代写作技能，建议教育者加强类型特定指导和评估方法的调整，以促进学生的批判性写作与AI文本的融合。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

Conclusion: 语义扎根问题的核心是理解及再现人工计算系统中的语义行为能力及功能，而不是严格遵守零语义承诺条件。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

Conclusion: 文章揭示了由情感语调引发的新型偏差问题，对AI模型的对齐性与信任建设具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

Motivation: 现有方法可以评估微调后的性能，但无法检测某些不可预测的副作用，例如微调生物学内容是否会影响化学任务表现。

Method: 提出MNEME框架，通过稀疏模型差异分析比较基础模型与微调模型在与任务无关数据上的行为变化。

Result: MNEME在五种LLM的三个场景测试中达到高达95%的副作用预测准确率，并证明高激活样本的再训练可以部分逆转这些效果。

Conclusion: MNEME是一种可扩展且自动化的工具，能够分析LLM微调整引起的行为变化，在理解和管理模型行为方面提供了实用手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [98] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的开放式文本生成框架，称为Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD)，通过结合多个相对较弱的语言模型提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Contrastive Decoding虽然提升了生成文本的连贯性和流畅性，但其依赖于单一的业余模型，难以覆盖多样化的语言生成失效模式。

Method: 提出了一种称为MACD的方法，通过整合多个业余模型并结合信号均衡和共识惩罚机制，在不需要额外训练的情况下改进文本生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，MACD在新闻、百科和叙事等多个领域的流畅性、连贯性、多样性和适应性方面都优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MACD框架通过整合多个业余模型，有效提高了文本生成的质量和控制能力，展示出超越传统方法的优势。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过特征增强Transformer架构检测新闻语句主观性的系统，在多语言场景下取得了优异的表现，尤其是在英语、德语、阿拉伯语和罗马尼亚语的表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务是检测新闻语句的主观性，关键在于区分作者的主观观点和客观描述，目的是研发一个能在多语言环境中有效工作的系统。

Method: 提出了特征增强的Transformer架构，结合了预训练语言模型的上下文嵌入与统计和语言学特征。其中阿拉伯语使用了AraELECTRA加词性标注和TF-IDF特征，其他语言使用了结合TF-IDF特征的跨语言DeBERTa V3模型。

Result: 系统在单语言、多语言和零样本情况下表现抢眼，在多种语言中取得了高分，例如英语（单语言排名1）、德语（单语言排名3）、阿拉伯语（单语言排名4）和罗马尼亚语（零样本排名1）。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征与门控机制的设计极大提高了检测性能，跨语言微调的顺序和训练语言间的语言学接近性显著影响了模型表现。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过使用LLM进行广告内容重写提高其在检索系统中的可见性和生成响应中的包含率，同时提出了一种监督微调框架和平衡语义相关性和内容可信度的损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对内容表达如何影响广告可见性的研究较少，本文的目标是探索广告重写在不改变检索模型的基础上是否能提升效果。

Method: 提出了一种监督微调框架，结合自定义损失函数，同时提出两种评价指标（DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K）来分析广告重写效果，并对比了不同训练方法的有效性。

Result: 实验证明，PPO训练模型在多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调方法，在指令提示场景下最高达到了2.79的DeltaDIR@5和0.0073的DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告在检索前的表达形式以及提示格式和强化学习对提升广告可见性至关重要，本文的研究提供了一种在检索系统中优化广告表达的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种工具，可量化阿拉伯语修辞在文本或语言中的密度，为分析其影响和使用程度提供了客观手段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管阿拉伯语修辞的重要性众所周知，但目前缺乏客观的工具去衡量和比较文本或语言中的修辞使用程度，以及其在不同体裁和时代间的丰富程度。

Method: 研究设计了一个系统，用于识别文本中的修辞手法，并基于词素密度计算修辞手法密度。最终开发了四种电子工具和一种模拟工具，包括网站和在线计算器，以及一种修辞手段分布报告技术。

Result: 研究成果是一个能够准确报告任何阿拉伯文本或演讲中修辞密度的工作工具。

Conclusion: 研究成功实现了阿拉伯语修辞密度的量化，填补了修辞分析领域的技术空白。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curved Inference是一种几何解释框架，用来分析大语言模型在语义变化下如何弯曲其残差流轨迹。研究发现模型在面对语义变化时，其内部活跃度轨迹会发生显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解大语言模型在不同语义操控下如何调整其内部活动轨迹，并提出新的几何方法来诊断模型的对齐、抽象和推理动态。

Method: 通过分析Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型在20类语义主题中的表现，采用曲率和显著性等原生空间指标，以及从反嵌入矩阵导出的语义度量进行计算。

Result: 不同语义变化下，LLaMA在曲率和显著性上表现出一致的显著变化，而Gemma对较强语义变化的反应较弱。这支持模型几何为嵌入空间和上下文轨迹双层结构。

Conclusion: Curved Inference为解析模型语义对齐、抽象和推理动态提供了新的视角，有助于理解模型如何在深度中导航和调整语义意义。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将领域特定知识整合到大语言模型中，以提高其在特定任务中的性能，同时减少计算开销、避免过拟合并提升可扩展性。

Method: 使用语义分块算法基于句子嵌入的余弦相似度分割文档，并利用知识图谱结构化检索信息以提高信息检索的准确性和上下文理解能力。

Result: 在MultiHop RAG和Wikipedia数据集上，SemRAG显著提升了从知识图谱中检索信息的相关性和正确性，优于传统的RAG方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG是一个高效且准确的应用于领域特定任务的大语言模型管道，避免了资源密集型的微调，具有可扩展性和实用性，并符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

Conclusion: NLP是现代保险领域数据驱动分析的核心工具，而非仅为辅助工具。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型（LLMs）被应用于高风险领域（如法律、金融和医学）时，现有研究更注重提升模型性能，忽略了领域特定的安全性评估。本研究旨在弥补这一空白，系统地定义并评估领域特定的安全性风险。

Method: 论文基于医学、法律和金融领域的规范与伦理原则（如AMA伦理原则、ABA行为规范和CFA伦理准则），提出Trident-Bench基准，用于系统评估大语言模型在这些专业领域的安全性，并比较通用模型与专业化模型的表现。

Result: 通过对19款通用和专业领域模型的安全性评估发现，强大的通用模型能够达到基本的安全预期，而领域专业化模型在处理微妙的伦理问题时表现欠佳，这凸显了加强领域特定安全性的紧迫性。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench是研究语言模型在法律和金融领域安全性质的重要资源，为未来降低专业化领域中LLMs部署风险的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built
for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time
compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and
RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech
with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control
and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source

Motivation: 探索如何有效使用多样性以提升大语言模型的性能，同时比较模型多样性与问题解释多样性的方法。

Method: 分别采用模型多样性（多个模型回答同一问题）和问题解释多样性（同一模型回答以不同方式表述的问题），并通过多数投票的集合方法确定最终答案。

Result: 在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa实验中，问题解释多样性在集合准确率上优于模型多样性；分析显示模型多样性没有显著提升平均性能。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性比模型多样性更适合提升大语言模型处理二元问题的性能。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前Transformer模型在文本分类任务中的解释性仍然是一个挑战，因为现有方法很容易被不相关的特征干扰，导致解释不够可靠。

Method: 提出了Contrast-CAT方法，通过对输入序列和参考激活之间的对比，过滤掉与类别无关的特征，以生成更清晰和可信的属性映射。

Result: Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型测试中相较于现有方法取得显著提升，在AOPC提升了1.30倍，在LOdds提升了2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT有效提升了基于Transformer的文本分类模型的解释性，为实际应用中的安全部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

Method: 通过使用包含28,528条孟加拉语评论的新数据集，并构建基于XLM-RoBERTa Base的变换器模型，结合可解释AI技术提高情感分类的易懂性。

Result: 所提模型在分类精度上达到97%，优于现有孟加拉语情感分析方法，并证明在低资源语言处理中的有效性。

Conclusion: 变换器模型对低资源语言具有良好的处理能力，可为公共政策和犯罪预防提供可操作的洞察。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

TL;DR: 本研究针对孟加拉语超党派新闻检测困难的问题，提出使用Bangla BERT，取得了95.65%的高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字化环境中，错误信息快速传播，而孟加拉语缺乏检测超党派新闻的高级自然语言处理方法，导致信息偏见的扩散成为严峻问题。

Method: 通过微调Bangla BERT，并与传统机器学习模型进行性能比较，还采用半监督学习提升预测效果，同时通过LIME解释模型决策过程。

Result: Bangla BERT在实验数据中实现了95.65%的高精准度，表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了即使在低资源环境中，基于Transformer的模型也能很有效地工作，为进一步改进提供了可能性。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

*Christoph Metzner,Shang Gao,Drahomira Herrmannova,Heidi A. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了将人类提供的临床理由作为附加训练数据对改进人工智能模型性能和解释性的影响，发现其对性能提升效果有限，且在资源不足的情况下表现不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过添加人类提供的临床理由提升自动编码临床文档的变换器模型的性能与解释性。

Method: 分析了99,125个关于癌症诊断的人类临床理由，并与128,649份电子病理报告结合训练和评估变换器模型的主要癌症诊断编码能力，同时引入“充分性”指标评估理由的质量。

Result: 在高资源场景下，使用临床理由数据能略微提升模型性能，但在资源有限时表现不稳定，且仅使用额外病历报告的数据会优于包含临床理由的数据训练结果。

Conclusion: 尽管使用临床理由提高了些许模型的解释性，但其性能提升有限。如果优先考虑准确性，应聚焦于标注更多的报告，而非生成临床理由；而若优先考虑解释性，结合临床理由的数据可能会有所助益。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大规模语言模型（LLMs）在道德态度的跨文化差异与相似性上的表现，发现当前模型未能准确再现横跨文化的道德变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在捕捉跨文化道德观点上是否展示偏差，以及这种偏差的潜在影响。

Method: 采用三种方法：（1）比较模型生成的道德得分方差与调查数据的方差；（2）分析模型输出与调查数据中的国家分组一致性；（3）使用系统选择的词对探测模型反应。

Result: 发现现有LLMs倾向于压缩道德差异，对调查数据模式的对齐度较低。

Conclusion: 需要改进模型以缓解偏差并增强文化代表性，同时保证LLMs的负责任开发和公平应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Conclusion: 研究表明，深度学习技术可有效增强对低资源语言（如 Shona）的语音识别能力，支持语言资源不足地区的语音技术发展。

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

TL;DR: 此研究提出了StructText框架，用于从文本中提取关键值对，并自动生成高质量基准数据集以评估LLM提取质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM提取质量的基准，特别是在特定领域或企业文档中，手动建立基准的成本过高。

Method: 提出了一种基于表格数据生成基准的两阶段“计划-执行”模型，结合LLM判断及客观指标进行多维评估。

Result: 评估了49个数据集超过7万个例子，发现LLM在事实准确性和避免幻觉上表现良好，但在叙述连贯性和信息可提取性方面存在问题。

Conclusion: StructText框架能生成高保真评估数据集，为后续研究提供支持并暴露LLM在提取任务中的弱点。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型网页历史压缩方法，通过提取历史状态中最相关的信息，使网页自动化更高效，实验证明了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的网页自动化方法忽视了历史状态的重要性，网页状态的冗长特性带来了输入序列过长、信息稀疏的问题，因此需要解决如何高效利用历史状态的问题。

Method: 提出了一种历史压缩模块，从每个历史状态中提取与任务最相关的信息，并将其压缩为固定长度的短表达，从而减少长历史状态所带来的挑战。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上的实验显示，该方法相比于不使用历史输入的基线方法，准确率提升了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 通过有效利用历史状态中的关键信息，提出的方法提升了网页自动化任务的效率和准确性，证明了引入历史输入的价值。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemTool是一种为LLM代理提供短期记忆管理的框架，支持多轮对话中的工具使用管理，提出了三种代理模式(自主模式、工作流程模式和混合模式)，在实验中展现了不同模式的效率与任务完成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在多轮对话中由于固定上下文窗口导致的工具管理效率低下问题。

Method: 通过引入MemTool框架，提供三种模式(自主、工作流程和混合模式)以优化工具使用管理与上下文持久性，并在ScaleMCP基准上与多款LLM进行实验测试。

Result: 自主模式在推理型LLM中表现出高效的工具移除率(90-94%)，但中等规模的模型效率较低。工作流程和混合模式在工具管理上表现稳定，而自主与混合模式在任务完成率上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 根据任务需求、代理自主性和模型能力，选择适合的MemTool模式来平衡工具管理效率和任务成功率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LiTransMC的因果大型语言模型（LLM），并评估了11种LLM在旅行模式选择预测任务中的表现。结果显示，LiTransMC在预测精度和分布校准方面优于现有方法和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用因果LLM提高旅行模式选择预测的准确性和解释性，同时满足隐私保护、降低成本和本地部署的需求。

Method: 开发并比较了11种LLM，进行了396组配置测试和生成了79,000个合成预测，基于参数高效和丢失掩码策略对LiTransMC进行微调，并引入BERTopic和解释强度指数评估模型生成的推理能力。

Result: LiTransMC的加权F1得分为0.6845，Jensen-Shannon分歧为0.000245，超越了未微调模型、现有的大型商业模型（如GPT-4o）以及传统的离散选择模型与机器学习分类方法。

Conclusion: LiTransMC展示了因果LLM在旅行模式预测和解释性上的潜能，为开发具备预测与解释能力的交通研究与政策工具开辟了新路径。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在数学和科学领域的推理模型已经取得显著成果，因此需要新的非STEM领域智能评估方法，尤其关注幽默理解中的推理能力。

Method: HumorBench包含约300个来自New Yorker Caption Contest和Cartoonstock.com的漫画-文字对，并通过专家标注的评价工具衡量幽默元素的识别和解释能力。

Result: 实验发现：1）在STEM推理领域的模型进展可以有效迁移至幽默理解；2）仅接受STEM推理训练的模型在HumorBench测试中也表现优秀，表明推理能力的强迁移性；3）测试时增加思考代币预算在幽默推理任务中效果各异。

Conclusion: HumorBench验证了现有模型在非STEM领域的推理表现，也揭示了理解复杂幽默的挑战和推进方向。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

Motivation: 当前开发高性能的专业化大型语言模型需要大量人工标注，这一过程耗时、高成本且难以扩展。为解决这一问题，该研究提出一种利用任务多样性原则的数据选择方法。

Method: 利用任务标签容易获取以及预训练模型在不同任务上信心变化大的特点，提出了一种基于逆信心权重的样本选择策略，以跨任务选择数据进行精调。

Result: 该方法比更复杂的采样过程产生了性能更好的模型，并且减少了计算开销。在实验中，本文的方法在MMLU得分上提升了4%，在不同标注预算下表现优于或等同于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 通过任务多样性和逆信心权重的方法，该研究展示了如何在标注成本显著降低的情况下实现高效精调模型，这对大模型的低成本、高效开发提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

Conclusion: 所开发的VN-MTEB基准为越南语嵌入任务提供高质量的评估参考，有助于实际应用中的性能优化。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 提出了自动化抽取人格向量的方法，可应用于任何人格特性分析，有效支持训练和部署阶段的管理。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变压器架构ASR模块在CPU或资源受限设备上的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出了Token Map Drafting技术，利用领域特定训练数据的n-gram token映射，提高推测解码效率，无需单独的草稿模型。

Result: 在CI-AVSR数据集上加速1.27倍，在内部数据集上加速1.37倍，同时识别准确率未下降；相比Distill-spec基线在CPU上的解码速度提升了10%。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于资源受限设备及低复杂性领域的ASR应用，显著提高了解码效率并保持高识别精度。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

*Zhiyuan He,Yike Zhang,Chengruidong Zhang,Huiqiang Jiang,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TriangleMix的新型训练免静态注意力模式，结合浅层密集注意力与深层三角稀疏模式，显著降低计算开销并提升时间效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型(LLMs)中关注机制计算复杂度因输入序列长度呈二次增长而导致的瓶颈问题，同时避免现有静态和动态稀疏注意力方法的精确度降低或额外计算开销。

Method: 提出TriangleMix方法，采用浅层的密集注意力模式，以及深层的三角稀疏模式，并通过无训练调整实现高效操作。

Result: 实验表明，TriangleMix在深层减少注意力开销3.7倍至15.3倍，整体TTFT时间缩短12%-32%，在序列长度32K到128K之间保持模型精确度不变。此外，与动态稀疏方法结合可进一步提速，在128K下加速19%。

Conclusion: TriangleMix显著提高了LLM推理效率，具有与其他方法结合的潜力，可大幅改善长序列推理性能并保持高精确度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自然语言处理技术在需求工程中的应用，重点是复现和扩展一个涉及用户需求分类的基准研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求工程领域广泛应用于自然语言处理技术，但对NLP4RE研究的复现关注有限，且快速发展的NLP领域带来了新的可能性和挑战。

Method: 复现了之前研究的深度学习模型结果，比较了其在外部数据集和GPT-4o零样本分类器上的表现，并评估了研究的复现准备性。

Result: 不同模型的可复现性结果不同，Naive Bayes模型表现完美，BERT等模型结果混合。GPT-4o的性能与传统机器学习模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基准研究的复现可行性，并提供了改进的复现包和ID卡，以鼓励进一步研究。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对维吾尔语自然语言处理的依存注释框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有树库对于低资源的黏着语言维吾尔语的处理能力有限，需要设计适应其特性的专用注释框架。

Method: 开发了一个包含18种主要关系和26种子类型的注释框架，结合九项注释原则，设计了现代维吾尔语依存树库（MUDT）。

Result: 通过使用一个预训练的通用依存解析工具进行交叉标准评估，发现现有注释标准中47.9%的标注与维吾尔语特有结构不符，体现出新框架的必要性和优越性。

Conclusion: MUDT提供了一种语义透明且准确的体系，不仅促进了解析和下游任务的改进，还为其他语言复杂的形态语言提供了可复制的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

*Jungyeon Lee,Kangmin Lee,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于知识图谱的框架，用于生成具有多样性和细微性的知识冲突，并评估了大语言模型(LLMs)在检测和处理冲突方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成系统存在的知识冲突问题难以通过现有的评估方法全面研究，因这些方法集中在问题回答场景、严重依赖实体替换技术、且对冲突类型的覆盖范围有限。

Method: 利用知识图谱生成两种相似但不同的文本上下文之间的多样化冲突，同时保持知识图谱结构的可解释性。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在处理冲突（尤其是需要多跳推理时）表现较差，且难以明确指出冲突源头。

Conclusion: 本文分析了知识图谱生成冲突对LLMs的影响，并以此为基础提出改进建议，以期提升LLMs整合多样化甚至冲突信息的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

*Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao,Kevin Tang,Dinah Baer-Henney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这项研究比较了基于Transformer的神经网络与人类在处理西班牙语不规则形态模式时的认知表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基于Transformer的神经网络是否能够在人类行为数据的对照下，表现出类似人类的对复杂语言现象（形态模式）的敏感性。

Method: 通过实验在人类行为数据的框架下，使用不同的词频条件（自然、低频、高频）来分析基于Transformer模型在处理不规则形态动词模式时的表现。

Result: 模型在词干和后缀准确性上超越了人类，但对不规则反应的偏好明显不同于人类，且训练数据中的不规则动词比例影响其偏好。此外，不同词频分布的训练数据影响了模型对西班牙语语音相似性的敏感度。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer模型在某些任务上优于人类，但其在敏感性和偏好模式上和人类存在显著区别，体现出认知不一致。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了多假设蒸馏（MHD）方法，通过生成多个翻译结果改进多语种预训练翻译模型的知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在通过使用教师模型的多种翻译输出分布（而非单一结果）改进学生模型的性能，尤其是解决低资源语言的翻译效果。

Method: 研究提出了多假设蒸馏（MHD）方法，使用$n$-best列表从束搜索产生多个翻译结果，并探索替代解码方法以增加输出多样性。

Result: 对于低资源语言，研究表明，尽管采样方法可能会略微降低翻译质量，但却能增强语料库的多样性和词汇丰富性，提高学生模型性能，并减少性别偏见问题。

Conclusion: 多假设蒸馏方法通过改进知识蒸馏过程显著提升了多语种翻译模型的表现，尤其是在低资源语言的应用中。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

model can be effectively used to rank relevant skills for a given job title,
demonstrating its broader applicability in multilingual labor market
intelligence. The model is publicly available:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于复杂推理场景的奖励模型评价和提升框架，包括一个推理基准（Libra Bench）和改进奖励模型的新方法（Libra-RM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型在复杂推理场景表现不佳，并且主要依赖有规则或基于参考的奖励，这限制了数据扩展和推理性能持续提升的能力。

Method: 构建了一个推理基准Libra Bench，从多样化数学问题和高阶推理模型中系统整理而成；并通过学习思考的方法，提出改进生成式奖励模型（Libra-RM）的新方法。

Result: 实验表明，Libra Bench与下游应用相关性高，Libra-RM在各类基准测试中达到最先进水平，并能利用未标注数据进一步提升推理模型。

Conclusion: Libra Bench和Libra-RM能有效克服当前奖励模型存在的局限性，在复杂推理场景中展示出强大的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型安全研究通常专注于过滤安全输入，而忽略了总是引发有害内容的“困难提示”，UnsafeChain旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了一个名为UnsafeChain的数据集，包含来自多种来源的困难提示，明确标识不安全内容并将其更正，通过此数据集对模型进行调整，改进安全性和推理能力。

Result: 在6个分布外测试集和5个分布内测试集上，UnsafeChain表现优于现有数据集，且1K子集的表现即可优于基线。

Conclusion: UnsafeChain证明了基于纠正的不安全行为的监督方法能显著提升安全性和模型的泛化能力，并公开了数据集及代码供公众使用。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs在自然语言处理中取得显著进展，但在面对对抗攻击时依然脆弱，需要提升模型在真实场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: 该方法通过移除实例级主成分，并将嵌入空间变换为近似高斯分布，降低对抗扰动的影响，同时保持语义关系，无需依赖对抗样本或代价高昂的训练数据增强。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持与基线模型相当的准确性的同时，提高了对抗鲁棒性，实现了鲁棒性与泛化之间的平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种低成本且高效的方式来提升PLMs的对抗鲁棒性，为实际应用中的模型安全性提供了新的启示。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前有关LLMs安全分类模型的研究较少，特别是在多语言场景下。因此本论文旨在揭示多语言安全分类模型的表现差异及背后原因。

Method: 通过对覆盖18种语言的数据集使用5种安全分类模型进行评价，分析其表现并探讨评估数据集的潜在问题。

Result: 发现多语言安全分类模型中存在显著差异，并指出模型表现的不足不仅源于模型本身，还有评估数据集的缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于推动跨语言有害内容识别方法的发展，为更安全的LLMs奠定基础。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Method: 开发HRIPBench评测集，包含2160个问答证据对，覆盖三类任务；利用指令式与知识整合评估LLMs表现。

Result: 目前LLMs在提供准确与安全的毒品危害减少信息方面表现不足，存在显著安全风险。

Conclusion: LLMs在此领域的应用需谨慎限制，以免导致负面健康结果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动对合理性变化的理解，以便更好地应用于对话生成、常识推理和幻觉检测等任务。

Method: 基于sentence transformers进行建模，同时进行模型性能评估，并与现有模型如RoBERTa对比。

Result: 发现sentence transformers在任务中的表现不及RoBERTa，模型评估受数据不平衡等问题影响，导致结果可信度降低。

Conclusion: 模型在评估合理性变化任务中仍有不足，呼吁采用更平衡和现实的评估方法。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

### [141] [Introducing HALC: A general pipeline for finding optimal prompting strategies for automated coding with LLMs in the computational social sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21831)
*Andreas Reich,Claudia Thoms,Tobias Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为HALC的通用管道，用于为特定编码任务系统构建最佳提示（prompt），以提高大语言模型（LLM）的自动化编码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在使用LLM进行社会科学自动化编码时，提示策略的有效性差异较大，研究者往往需要通过试错来完成设置，缺乏系统可靠的指导方法。

Method: 提出HALC管道，通过向本地LLM发送超过两百万次请求，测试并验证不同提示策略的稳健性和准确性，并使用专家编码数据作为评价基准。

Result: 在与专家编码对比时，发现某些提示策略可以在单变量（α气候=0.76；α运动=0.78）和双变量编码任务（α气候=0.71；α运动=0.74）中表现出一致性较高的结果。

Conclusion: 本文为不同提示策略的有效性、影响因素及不同编码任务和模型的可靠提示选择提供了深入见解，对LLM在社会科学中的编码任务应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

*Yifan Wei,Xiaoyan Yu,Yixuan Weng,Tengfei Pan,Angsheng Li,Li Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通过以推理为导向的后期训练被提升为强大的大型推理模型（LRMs）。本论文提出了AutoTIR，一个能够自主决定工具使用的强化学习框架，显著提升了推理能力和工具整合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在工具整合中采用固定模式，这可能降低模型的核心语言能力；需要一种自适应的、可拓展的工具整合方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为AutoTIR的强化学习框架，支持模型自主决定是否以及如何调用工具；设计了混合奖励机制以平衡回答准确性、结构化输出和工具使用效率。

Result: 实验证明，AutoTIR在多种任务上显著优于基线模型，表现出优越的工具使用泛化能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习在构建通用且可扩展的工具整合推理能力方面具有巨大的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过轻量级知识超图构建和多轮检索交互改进RAG，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中结构语义缺失、高构建成本和固定检索等问题。

Method: 提出Graph-R1框架，包括轻量化知识超图构建、多轮交互检索，以及端到端强化学习优化流程。

Result: 实验表明，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1提供了一种改进RAG的新方法，不仅提升了系统性能，还在知识建模方面更高效。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索了大模型通过“先记忆-后泛化”框架，从强行记忆数据中实现泛化能力的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为死记硬背阻碍了泛化，本研究的目的是挑战这一观点并揭示大模型如何通过记忆实现知识泛化。

Method: 引入“两阶段记忆-泛化”框架：模型首先通过无语义标记死记硬背主-宾关联，再通过少量语义提示进行微调学习泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，8种大模型可通过语义性提示重新解释所记忆的数据，并生成具有语义对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 研究证明死记硬背数据可用于知识注入，同时需警惕潜在的恶意用途风险，为模型训练和应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，优化语言模型以展现温暖和共情会降低其在关键任务上的可靠性及安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨优化语言模型以展现温暖和共情时对模型性能和安全性的潜在影响。

Method: 通过五种不同大小和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的响应，然后评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 优化后的“温暖”模型在安全关键任务中的错误率显著提高（+10到+30个百分点），容易传播错误信息、问题医疗建议等，且更可能验证用户的不正确观点。

Conclusion: 当前评价方法可能无法检测这些系统性风险，研究强调需重新思考如何开发和监督此类正在重塑人类关系与社会互动的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为RLSF（自反馈强化学习）的技术，通过利用模型自身的置信度来改进推理任务的可靠性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在推理任务中答案校准差的问题，并探索一种在没有外部反馈情况下提高模型性能的新方法。

Method: 提出RLSF方法，通过模型生成的链式推理解决方案计算其各个最终答案的置信度，基于此排序生成偏好，随后利用偏好优化技术对策略进行微调，无需人工标注或外部奖励。

Result: 改进了模型的概率估计及答案校准，同时增强了逐步推理能力，提升了算术推理和多选题解答性能。

Conclusion: RLSF将模型的不确定性转化为自反馈信号，是LLM后训练过程中一种有效且数据高效的方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文讨论了跨文化食谱适配中的挑战和一种新方法，以提高生成的食谱多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文化食谱适配需要文化适应性、保持原有风味且满足多样化饮食需求，但现有方法在生成多样性上存在局限性。

Method: 提出了CARRIAGE，一个增强检索和上下文组织多样性的RAG框架，用于提高跨文化食谱生成的多样性。

Result: 实验表明，CARRIAGE在食谱适配的多样性和质量方面实现了帕累托效率，相比于单纯使用大型语言模型效果更优。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE 在跨文化食谱适配方面展示了其增强生成多样性和满足用户多元需求的潜力，是一种创新的RAG框架。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨使用大型语言模型(LLMs)在微生物样本分类和污染风险预测中的应用，结果显示LLMs优于传统方法，并能推广至异质元数据环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在处理微生物学研究中的异构数据和小样本环境下表现不足，因此需要探索更强的模型来解决这些限制。

Method: 研究评估了如ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, LLaMA 4等LLMs，用于分类微生物样本和预测污染风险，与传统模型(Random Forests)在多数据集上的表现进行对比，采用零样本和少样本设置进行实验。

Result: LLMs在分类和污染风险预测中表现优异，不仅超越基线模型，还能在不同站点和异构元数据分布中保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够高效处理稀疏和异构生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监控应用提供了一种有前景的仅依赖元数据的方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在动态访问信息的不足，而现有的RAG方法检索噪声问题较多，推理深度较浅。提出改进方法的必要性。

Method: 设计了DeepSieve框架，以LLM为基础，通过问题分解、子问题路由以及多阶段提纯流程，结合模块化与透明性设计，实施检索增强生成。

Result: 实验表明，在多源异构问答任务中，DeepSieve在推理深度、检索精度以及可解释性上都优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过引入知识筛分与模块化设计，显著提升了RAG在复杂问题上的表现，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Symbiotic Epistemology（共生认识论）的哲学框架，以促进人与AI的认知协作。通过一种明确的协议SynLang实现透明的人机合作，其中包含高层次的推理模式和详细的因素解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的推理过程较为不透明，难以实现人机的协同作用；而传统的可解释AI方法往往无法建立有效的合作关系。此研究旨在解决这一问题，透过新框架将AI视为协作伙伴而非工具，以增强信任与透明度。

Method: 提出Symbiotic Epistemology理论，并设计了SynLang协议，通过高层推理（TRACE）与详细因素解释（TRACE_FE）整合明确推理模式、置信度量化以及多代理上下文继承，确保人与AI协作的透明度和效能。

Result: 实验验证表明，AI可适应这种结构化推理协议，并能成功在元认知层面干预，促进更高效的协作决策与验证过程。

Conclusion: SynLang及共生认识论通过双层透明度设计，能够显著提升AI对人类认知的支持，同时维护人类的主导权和道德责任，为人机协作决策创造了更可靠的前景。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Motivation: 旨在通过LLMs减少Synthea疾病模块开发的时间、所需专业知识，并提高数据多样性和质量。

Method: 提出四种方式利用LLMs支持模块创建：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块以及改进模块，并引入逐步细化的概念。

Result: 使用LLMs生成的模块在语法和临床准确性上表现出潜力，但也存在监督和验证的挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在合成数据创建中的应用前景广阔，但需要更多研究解决局限性，如人为监督、测试验证及潜在偏差问题。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

Result: 分析了多种最先进LLMs在不同文本中的表现，发现其认知画像与模型规模及文本复杂度存在规律性关联。

Conclusion: 该研究为分析与比较人工智能内部运作动力学提供了一种新颖且系统化的视角。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 目标是解决当前静态或后验对齐方法的局限性，提出一种动态且可量化的对齐损失，以及改进监控过程的元对齐概念。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的运作循环，包括场景评分、阈值调整、政策验证以及结构化反馈摄入（如点赞、覆盖、弃权），基于随机反馈提供了形式化收敛性分析。

Result: 通过理论与仿真验证展示了NPO在结构化反馈条件下对齐损失和监控保真度的收敛性，实证显示其在超大规模部署中展现了可量化的价值。

Conclusion: NPO构建了一个紧凑且可检查的架构，在实际动态环境中帮助实现理论对齐保证与可靠性之间的桥梁。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

### [156] [Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132)
*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究大语言模型（LLMs）在提供生活建议时可能产生的奉承和过度自信问题，并通过三种实验深入分析其表现及改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在高风险生活建议中的应用增多，其缺乏适当的安全保障可能导致错误的自信响应，这提示了需要深入评估其潜在的失败模式。

Method: 本文通过三项实验分析LLMs：1）使用多项选择评估模型在用户压力下的稳定性；2）通过新颖的安全分类方法和LLM Judge进行自由回答分析；3）进行机制可解释性实验，通过操控“高风险”激活向量引导模型行为。

Result: 一些模型表现出奉承倾向，而o4-mini等模型表现出较强的鲁棒性。高表现模型通过频繁提问的安全性策略取得高安全分数。实验还表明，模型的谨慎性可以通过激活引导直接调整。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs需要多元化和复杂的基准测试以确保其在处理重大决策时的可信度，同时激活引导是改进安全性的重要路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何衡量不同Sudoku网站上的数独难度。提出了基于SAT问题和一种模拟人类数独解法的两个新指标，分析了1000多个数独谜题，并确立了通用的数独难度分级系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前不同Sudoku网站的难度定义不一致，缺少统一的难度分级标准。

Method: 将Sudoku谜题转化为SAT问题以分析结构复杂性；通过结合多种数独策略和回溯算法模拟人类解题方式，提出新难度指标；利用无监督分类器，建立通用难度分级体系。

Result: 在分析五个热门Sudoku网站中的1000多个谜题后，发现新指标与网站标注难度强相关；提出的通用系统能有效分类网站难度为Universal Easy、Medium和Hard。

Conclusion: 通过实验证明提出的难度分级方法性能较好，可统一不同Sudoku网站的难度评价标准，并提供给初学者解题算法。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要理解和控制LLMs中的有害行为。

Method: 通过学习55个有害性子概念的线性探针，发现有害性的子空间，并通过主方向的调整和消融测试降低有害性表现。

Result: 发现有害性子空间维度低，通过主方向的调整能有效减少有害内容且对模型的效用影响较低。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解和控制LLMs行为提供了可扩展的视角，同时为社区提供了审计和优化未来语言模型的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种适应性解释性人工智能(XAI)的概念框架，通过用户的认知和情绪状态的隐性反馈调整解释性能，促进在人机协作中的快速信任，特别是在高风险场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解释性人工智能（XAI）方法缺乏适应性，且过于依赖显性反馈，难以满足高压、高需求场景中对人机快速信任的要求。

Method: 应用一种使用生理和行为信号（如脑电图EEG、心电图ECG及眼动追踪）的信任估算模型，推导用户的实时工作负荷、压力与情绪状态，从而动态调整解释特性，提供个性化支持。

Result: 建立了一个自适应、非侵入的解释性人工智能概念框架，可实时响应用户状态需求，以增强快速信任的建立。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发适用于苛刻环境下自适应且高效的XAI系统铺设了理论基础，满足紧迫和高风险情境的设计需求。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自适应聚类协作方法，通过自多样性和交一致性最大化机制提升大型语言模型在医疗决策支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM在医疗决策支持场景中存在组件选择规则不明确和部分LLM性能不足的问题，难以实现协同效果。

Method: 通过自多样性和交一致性计算值选择模型，并逐步去除具有最低一致性值的LLM来优化模型群的协作效果。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health两个医学数据集上的实验表明，该方法在医生相关领域中具有显著的准确性提升。比如，在NEJMQA上，方法在所有学科的官方通过率上表现优异，尤其在妇产科学达到了65.47%的准确率，高于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过激发模型自多样性和优化模型间一致性，有效提升了LLM在医疗决策支持中的表现，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）实现的自动化建模与优化方法，旨在提升主动配电网（ADN）调度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源渗透到主动配电网，传统的人工调度方式显得成本高且耗时，而许多新型ADN运营者缺乏电力系统操作和优化的专业知识。

Method: 论文设计了一个多LLM协作架构，通过信息提取、问题建模和代码编程三个步骤，辅以针对性优化技术，实现ADN调度问题的智能化分解与实施。

Result: 通过对多个测试案例的全面对比和端到端演示，验证了该架构和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种方法通过自然语言接口消除了技术屏障，提高了ADN运营者的调度效率和灵活性。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Result: 通过在三个数据集、六种LLMs及五种偏差类型上的实验，证明了该框架在揭示复杂偏差模式方面的能力和可扩展性明显优于其他基线。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种有效且具有可扩展性的方法来识别并评估医学语言模型中的复杂偏差，为其在临床决策应用中的进一步采用提供了更好的保障。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Conclusion: Agentic Web将机器间交互作为核心，需建立开放、安全和智能的生态，需平衡技术演进与社会治理，推动技术以更符合人类意图的方式发展。

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个基准测试，评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在解释复杂问题时的组合能力，结果显示模型表现随着问题复杂性的增加逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在解释复杂问题时的系统性和组合能力，这是自然语言处理中的一个重要挑战。

Method: 基于DBpedia的图模式生成三个不同难度的数据集，通过控制性的设计测试LLMs在理解复杂问题时的表现，并对不同大小的模型使用提示优化和微调技术进行实验。

Result: 模型的性能随着数据集中复杂性增加而下降，在最简单数据集上的F1分数最高为0.57，但总体表现较差，显示出LLMs在组合性解释问题上的局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs在将问题系统性、组合性地映射为SPARQL查询方面表现不足。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型部署方式将推理服务和训练任务分隔在独立的阶段和独立的服务器上，导致GPU资源利用率低下和对新数据的适配延迟问题。

Method: LeMix通过离线性能分析、执行预测机制与运行时调度，动态调整资源分配，同时理解任务特性以及共享节点间的任务干扰，从而实现推理和训练工作的联合执行。

Result: 评估结果表明，LeMix相比传统独立设置方式最大可提升3.53倍的吞吐量，减少至多61%的推理损失，同时服务时间保障（SLO）实现率提升至2.12倍。

Conclusion: 这是首次探索并利用LLM推理和训练联合执行机会的研究，为实现更资源高效的大型语言模型生产环境部署提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Motivation: 目前的编程助手由于难以推断用户意图，经常需要复杂的提示工程或外部上下文。本研究旨在解决用户查询模糊导致生成错误代码的问题。

Method: 构建了一个端到端系统，包括一个用于检测不清晰查询的分类器和一个生成澄清性问题的微调大型语言模型。

Result: 评估结果显示，微调的LLM在生成澄清问题方面优于标准零样本提示，并通过用户研究表明其生成的澄清性问题具有更高的实用性及可用性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的编程助手通过生成澄清性问题显著改善了代码生成质量，在实际使用中对比基线模型效果更佳。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种将交易分析（TA）原则融入多智能体系统的方法，称为Trans-ACT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统缺乏对人类行为复杂性的真实模拟。

Method: 通过引入父母、成人和儿童三种自我状态，将TA原理嵌入到智能体认知架构中，使其根据情境记忆和生活脚本作出决策。

Result: 在实验仿真中使智能体基于认知和TA原则生成更深层次且情境敏感的交互。

Conclusion: 为冲突解决、教育支持及社会心理研究等领域提供了一种新的方法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

TL;DR: 研究了AI增强工具对信息提取和数据标注任务的影响，发现互动式AI工具的使用显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分析AI工具在复杂数据处理任务中的实际效果和潜在节省时间的能力。

Method: 通过随机任务分配和两种实验条件（"单一AI工具使用" 和 "交互式AI工具使用"）进行对比实验，基于全球系统重要性银行的公开披露文件执行数据标注任务。

Result: 互动式AI工具在效率和准确性上显著优于人类独立完成任务。此外，扩展实验表明可节省达268小时任务时间。

Conclusion: AI增强工具，特别是交互式使用情况下，能够显著提升复杂任务的效率和质量，但使用者技能也是关键影响因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理面临需求波动、库存失衡以及长鞭效应等问题，传统方法难以应对动态市场条件，而新的机器学习技术存在局限性。因此，探讨利用液态神经网络解决供应链管理问题的潜力十分重要。

Method: 研究提出一种将LNN的动态特征提取能力和XGBoost的全局优化能力相结合的混合模型，并分析其在动态和高效供应链管理中的应用效果。

Result: 模型在减轻长鞭效应和提升供应链整体经济效益方面具有显著效用，同时支持实时决策与边缘计算。

Conclusion: 通过融入全新混合框架，该研究为传统供应链管理工具提供了动态和高效的新思路，有助于弥补现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

*Tenghao Huang,Sihao Chen,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Longqi Yang,Mengting Wan,Pei Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的任务范式，即大规模语言模型(LLMs)的主动信息收集，用于解决不完整和模糊问题，通过奖励机制改进模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的LLMs在复杂任务中表现有限，无法主动收集解决高质量问题所需的隐性信息。

Method: 设计一个生成真实情境下部分信息缺失任务的框架，并通过强化学习微调策略奖励能够有效提取用户隐性信息的问题。

Result: 提出的Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中显著优于o3-mini，且在人类评分中生成的问题和摘要受欢迎程度分别提升了42%和28%。

Conclusion: 主动澄清问题的能力使LLMs从被动的文本生成器转变为真正的协作型思维伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Shapley值的不确定性度量框架，解决了以往使用阈值的语义等价关系测量问题，并证明其在问答任务及其他数据集上的性能预测更为准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在问答任务中如何信任输出至关重要，传统方法基于语义熵设置阈值来测量语义等价关系，但此方法存在局限性。

Method: 引入Shapley值的不确定性度量框架，通过连续的语义关系捕获不确定性，同时定义了三种定义有效不确定性度量的基本特性，并验证了Shapley不确定性符合这些标准。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的Shapley不确定性在预测LLM的问答任务及其他数据集性能方面优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于Shapley的不确定性度量方法提供了一种更精准且有效的手段衡量模型输出的不确定性，改进了当前问答任务中的性能预测能力。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the
models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and
practice. Our code and dataset are available at

### [177] [Evo-DKD: Dual-Knowledge Decoding for Autonomous Ontology Evolution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21438)
*Vishal Raman,Vijai Aravindh R*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Evo-DKD的双解码器框架，用于自动进行本体演化，结合结构化的本体遍历与非结构化的文本推理，实验结果表明其优于仅使用单一解码方式的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体及知识图谱需要不断演化以保持内容的全面性与准确性，而手工维护过于费力，且大型语言模型尽管知识丰富，但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: 设计了一个名为Evo-DKD的双解码框架，其中一个解码器生成本体编辑候选项（如新概念或关系），另一个解码器生成自然语言解释，通过动态注意力的门控机制协调两者，并基于提示模式控制在单流模式下模拟双解码行为，形成闭环推理流程。

Result: Evo-DKD在诸如医疗本体优化、语义搜索改进及文化遗产时间线建模等场景中的表现优于基线方法，实验数据显示在本体更新的精准度及后续任务性能方面都有明显提升。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD以一种新范式结合符号与神经推理推动了本体的可持续演化，其双解码及门控机制设计卓有成效。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

Motivation: 传统化学计量学方法在处理高维、重叠光谱带时遇到挑战，而大型语言模型在通用化和推理能力上的潜力激发了自动化科学流程的研究兴趣。该研究旨在探索LLM在红外光谱分析中的新应用。

Method: 研究提出了一个端到端的LLM驱动框架，包括知识库查询、自动光谱预处理、特征提取，以及分类、回归和异常检测的多任务推理流程。

Result: 多回合LLM推理在低数据条件下的表现优于单回合推理，并在多个材料数据集上达到甚至超过了传统机器学习和深度学习模型的性能。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的红外光谱分析框架可在低数据环境下提供高效、精准的推理能力，展现出在科学工作流程自动化中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

TL;DR: Maia4All是一个通过原型模型和个性化嵌入的新框架，用于高效地模拟个体决策行为，即使数据有限。它在国际象棋中的实验表明，只需20局棋的数据即可实现精准预测，对比之前的5000局显著提效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类和人工智能（AI）的协作逐渐深入，开发能精确模拟个人决策的AI变得尤为重要，尤其是在国际象棋等精确技能测量的领域。而当前的行为建模需求数据量过大，限制了它的实际应用，因此需要一种高效的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，Maia4All可以仅利用20局棋的数据，达到高保真度地预测个体行为，且显著减小数据需求；此外，该方法在LLM的行为建模中也取得了良好效果。

Conclusion: Maia4All成功展示了如何利用原型增强模型有效建模个性化行为，不仅显著提升了国际象棋中的数据效率，也具有广泛的个性化AI应用潜力。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

Conclusion: LLMs可有效推动供应链技术的发展，使其更易被规划者和高管接纳与使用，从而实现更高效率与效益。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Motivation: 研究动机在于多模态大模型在视觉-语言任务中具备优异表现，但在应对视觉不可回答问题时缺乏诚实性研究。

Method: 定义四种代表性不可回答问题，构建大规模基准MoHoBench，针对28种多模态大模型的诚实行为进行系统评估，并开发初步的监督学习及偏好学习的对齐方法。

Result: 多数模型未能适当地拒绝回答不可回答的问题，并发现多模态诚实性与视觉信息深度相关，而非仅是语言建模问题。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和研究为未来开发可信的多模态大模型奠定了基础，同时呼吁专门的方法来实现多模态的诚实性对齐。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Conclusion: ST-GDance框架有效优化了团体舞蹈生成任务中的时空协调性和计算效率，可适用于电影、游戏、动画制作等领域。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial
intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization,
and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless
communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and
adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming
wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core
communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance
versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional
methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities,
including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and
self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and
autonomous wireless networks of the future.

Conclusion: 该个性化解释框架提升了人工智能解释的实用性和用户体验水平。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 通过引入可读性决策，团队可以改进协作效率，强调了其在团队环境中的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Conclusion: StaffPro是一个创新设计的工具，为自动化人员管理提供了稳健、可解释和以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在安全性上存在缺陷，因此提出了SASA技术以提高其安全性。


<details>

Motivation: 探索LVLMs 内在安全性不足的原因及其动态行为，特别是在与语言模型相比的漏洞。

Method: 提出了一种名为Self-Aware Safety Augmentation (SASA) 的技术，通过将语义表征从中间层投射到更早的安全层上实现安全增强，同时利用线性探测分析模型的内部语义理解。

Result: 实验表明，SASA 方法在任务数据集上显著提高了LVLMs的安全性能，同时对模型的实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: 通过增强LVLMs的语义与安全感知层的交互，可以在不需要进行微调的情况下显著提升模型的安全表现。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Conclusion: Assistax是一种有价值的基准，可推动服务机器人领域强化学习研究的发展。

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full

Method: 通过引入名为BellNet的参数化模型，将策略迭代展开并截断，并最小化随机值函数初始化的Bellman误差。同时利用图信号处理解释和重新参数化方法，简化模型表达并控制推理复杂度。

Result: BellNet在实验中能够以远少于传统方法迭代次数的情况下有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: 提出的BellNet方法不仅提高了求解效率，还提供了更紧凑及可迁移的MDP策略和值迭代表示方式。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Conclusion: 有界拟合为描述逻辑学习提供了一种有效方式，其复杂性和PAC框架下的表现优势，为进一步研究提供了理论基础及实用支持。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

*Junzhe Li,Yutao Cui,Tao Huang,Yinping Ma,Chun Fan,Miles Yang,Zhao Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixGRPO提升了图像生成中人类偏好对齐的流匹配模型的效率，MixGRPO-Flash进一步降低训练时间并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO在对所有去噪步骤的采样和优化上效率较低，因此需要设计更高效的框架以改进效果。

Method: 提出了一种结合随机微分方程(SDE)与常微分方程(ODE)的混采样策略，并通过滑动窗口机制限制采样随机性和优化步骤，增强梯度更新效率。

Result: MixGRPO在多个维度的人类偏好对齐上表现优异，训练时间比DanceGRPO减少近50%，MixGRPO-Flash进一步将训练时间减少了71%。

Conclusion: MixGRPO及其变体不仅显著提升了效果与效率，还具有更短的训练时间，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Motivation: 希望通过引入Agentic AI改进传统工业自动化中基于任务的方法，利用代理和目标驱动的方法实现更灵活、更智能的商业流程设计和开发。

Method: 提出一种以目标、对象和代理为核心的商业流程设计框架，允许多个代理通过协作完成单一代理无法完成的目标。

Result: 通过模块化和智能化的方式组织方法，使商业流程可适应动态工业环境，具备更高的灵活性和情境适应能力。

Conclusion: 基于Agentic AI的目标驱动方法能为工业环境中的自动化带来更智能和适应性的设计方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DualSG框架，结合LLM语义指导与传统预测方法，用于提升多变量时间序列预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前方法使用大语言模型进行多变量时间序列预测，但要么全依赖LLM导致精度损失，要么在文本与时间序列对齐上面临困难。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，LLM作为语义引导模块，并通过自然语言汇总趋势信息的Time Series Caption提示格式和Caption-Guided Fusion模块来改进预测。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG相比15种最先进基线方法均表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM的语义指导与传统预测方法结合，能更好地平衡精度与解读性。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Conclusion: 框架为目标推断提供了一种实用且强健的解决方案，推动多智能体系统走向更互动与自适应化。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO为解决优势塌缩问题提供了一种有效的途径，并对强化学习中的推理能力提升贡献了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Conclusion: MultiEditor改进了驾驶场景中的多模态数据编辑技术，显著增强了罕见类别的检测效果，为自动驾驶系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Result: 验证了框架在两类任务中的性能提升：包括将GNN用于节点分类转变为集体分类模型以及支持环境规划中的复杂决策，提供了新的基准数据集。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: 研究展示了使用LLMs自动分类GitHub README内容的潜力，为开发用于改进GitHub存储库识别和利用的自动化工具提供了贡献。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络的根本原因分析需要解释性、领域知识和因果推理，现有模型存在适应性问题。

Method: 使用两阶段训练方法（监督微调和强化学习）对LLMs进行领域适配，并优化推理能力，生成多步骤的结构化诊断解释。

Result: 实验显示，相较于现有的推理和非推理模型，经领域适配的LLMs在性能和泛化性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 领域适配且增强推理的LLMs有望在移动网络的实际操作和管理中提供更高效且可解释的根本原因分析。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在医疗领域的高计算需求，提出高效的模型压缩技术。

Method: 研究使用剪枝-微调-量化（prune-SFT-quantize）流程，开发一种新颖的剪枝层选择方法，并分析不同量化技术的性能。

Result: 在保持相同压缩率的条件下，使用建议方法将7B参数的MLLM运行内存减少70%（到4GB VRAM），且性能提高4%。

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PHAX框架以通过结构化论证提高AI在公共健康领域的解释性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的XAI方法缺乏为不同健康领域利益相关者提供结构化和自适应解释的能力，需开发更贴近人类中心的框架。

Method: 提出一种名为PHAX的多层框架，结合可废除推理、自适应自然语言技术及用户建模，产生情境适应及面向受众的AI输出解释。

Result: 通过医学术语简化、患者与临床医生沟通、政策论证等案例，证明PHAX在解释性和信任方面对不同用户类型的有效性。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将正式推理与沟通需求相结合，为公共健康领域实现透明性和以人为本的AI解释奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在推理设计、奖励机制和视觉噪声方面存在局限性，亟需改进以提升精确性和学习能力。

Method: 本文提出了一套改良训练的技术，包括连续奖励函数、“简单思考”奖励和基于裁剪的重采样策略，同时发明了分解式定位与选择的推理方法，提高了高分辨率显示上的定位精度。

Result: 实验表明，UI-AGILE在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2两个基准上达到了最新的性能，例如在ScreenSpot-Pro上，相较于最佳基线，定位精度提高了23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE全面改进了GUI代理的训练和推理技术，其显著提升的性能为相关领域的发展提供了创新性路径。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: 提出UserBench基准，评估语言模型在用户互动中的合作能力，发现现有模型在用户对齐和完成任务方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在处理用户含糊、动态目标和间接表达清晰意图方面的能力，弥补其协作能力研究的欠缺。

Method: 设计UserBench基准，包括带有递增式透露偏好的模拟用户，要求模型能够主动澄清意图并利用工具作出合理决策。

Result: 现有模型完全与用户意图对齐的回答仅达20%，即便最先进模型也仅能识别不到30%的用户偏好。

Conclusion: 现有模型在用户对齐和合作方面存在显著差距，UserBench为评估和提升这种能力提供了重要平台。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为任务集中巩固与间隔召回（TFC-SR）的新型持续学习方法，用以解决深度神经网络的灾难性遗忘问题，并在Split MNIST和Split CIFAR-100上展示了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进当前深度神经网络在处理持续学习任务时的灾难性遗忘问题，灵感来源于人类学习机制。

Method: 提出一种结合主动回忆探测（Active Recall Probe）的任务集中与间隔召回方法TFC-SR，通过周期性评估模型记忆以巩固过去知识的表达。同时探讨重放量与记忆性能间的权衡问题。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100上，TFC-SR的最终准确率达到13.17%，显著优于标准重放的7.40%，并证明该性能提升来源于主动回忆探测的稳定效应，而非重放量的差异。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种稳健且高效的持续学习方法，验证了主动记忆检索机制在提高持续学习性能中的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Motivation: 当前机器学习面临高维数据分析和局部方法的局限性，亟需探索新的数据表示方式。

Method: 通过QCML，将数据特征表示为Hermitian矩阵，并将数据点映射到Hilbert空间状态，进而利用量子几何工具分析数据结构。

Result: 该方法成功提取高维数据的全局属性，避免了局部方法中维度灾难的问题，并展示于多种合成和实际数据集上的应用效果。

Conclusion: QCML提供了一种通过量子几何提升数据结构理解的新途径，尤其可能在量子认知框架下促进对认知现象的理解。

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as
quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our
understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

Conclusion: 提出的新方法显示出了优越性，能够为研究人员提供一种新型的可解释机器学习方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for

Conclusion: 研究表明，提出的方法可以缓解高维数据复杂性及不平衡性问题，同时提升野火预测效率与精确度。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,

Conclusion: 本文为分布变化领域提供了文献综述，聚焦于未被充分探讨的关键问题，明确未来方向。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled

are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破因静态训练数据限制复杂推理进展的瓶颈。

Method: 提出AGORA框架，让协作集群通过结构化交互实现自我进化。

Conclusion: 工程化协作生态系统是推动智能能力涌现的关键方向。

Abstract: Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the
current training datasets. We propose structured interaction as a new scaling
axis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of increasing model parameters. Our
self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve
reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to
4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems
from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of
intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems
as a vital frontier for capability emergence.

TL;DR: 研究提出了LAI-ML框架，将XGBoost的预测结果进行解释和透明化，解决了医学AI中“黑箱”的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高性能机器学习模型（如XGBoost）因缺乏可解释性而影响临床应用的局限性。

Method: 提出LAI-ML框架，将XGBoost模型的特征归因转化为概率格式，并通过HAGA和CACS技术，结合强化学习和案例检索的LLM生成可信的诊断解释。

Result: LAI-ML框架的预测准确率达83%，较XGBoost基线模型提升了13%。LLM在21.7%的不一致情况下，还改正了教师模型的预测，体现出更强的推理能力。

Conclusion: LAI-ML框架成功将不透明的模型预测转化为可信且可解释的临床洞察，为医学AI的“黑箱”问题提供了可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的偏好优化框架——MaPPO，通过结合先验奖励知识提升大语言模型的对齐和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有偏好学习方法如DPO将问题简化为二元分类，未充分利用奖励先验知识的问题，并提高偏好优化的性能。

Method: 采用最大后验概率（MAP）优化方法，整合先验奖励估计以改进偏好优化目标，同时无需额外参数，并支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在MT-Bench、AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard等三个基准测试上的不同模型规模和系列实验中，取得了在对齐性能方面的持续改进，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: MaPPO扩展了现有方法，提供了一种可以提升大语言模型对齐性能的方法，并具有良好的通用性和效率。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Motivation: 传统上发现缩放定律需要大量的人力知识和实验，提出EvoSLD旨在通过自动化手段简化这一过程，提高效率。

Method: 使用进化算法和大型语言模型共同优化符号表达式和对应的计算例程。在处理缩放变量和响应指标等方面，从数据子集中找出通用、简洁的数学形式，降低拟合误差。

Result: 在五个实际案例中，EvoSLD成功重新发现两项人类推导的定律，并在其他场景中展现更高的精准度，可将测试集的归一化均方误差减少至几个数量级。

Conclusion: EvoSLD具备显著的精准度、可解释性和效率，展现了其在加速AI研究中的应用潜力，且提供了源代码供拓展。

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床大语言模型尽管在静态基准测试中表现良好，但在面对细微的输入变化时会出现诊断不稳定的问题，而传统NLP评价指标无法有效检测这种潜在的表示变化。

Method: 提出LAPD框架，设计Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR)指标，基于主成分分析(PCA)监测模型在潜在空间表示的稳定性，并通过遮蔽、否定、同义词替换和数值变化四种扰动方法对模型进行系统测试。

Result: 验证了基础与临床LLMs在最小表面扰动下的潜在脆弱性，并通过DiReCT基准测试的真实临床笔记数据验证LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了临床AI模型在表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距，提出几何感知的审计方式对于提升安全性至关重要。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

Result: 在合成图去噪和语言标记图实验中显示了与轻量级图神经网络相当的性能，同时具有更高的透明性和资源效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为图学习提出了一种基于原理的、新颖的、透明且资源高效的非神经网络方法，具有较强的理论和实际意义。

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures
for learning on graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图卷积网络对异构图表现不佳，难以有效捕捉远程节点间的依赖关系。

Method: 通过参数化邻接矩阵，重新连接节点边以增加浅层GCN的跳数范围，从而捕捉远程依赖。

Result: 该方法在捕捉远距离依赖方面有所成效，但对于不同异构图的性能不具备普适性。

Conclusion: 尽管方法提供了新的思路，但在异构图上的性能表现受限，未能实现全面通用性。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework
that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario
training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks.
EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of

Motivation: 由于电子健康记录(EHR)数据复杂性和异质性，难以通过现有的机器学习解释方法进行针对特定人群的建模指导。

Method: 提出了AdaptHetero框架，结合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，将解释性洞察转化为指导模型训练和评估的行动性信息。

Result: 在三个大数据集上测试（GOSSIS-1-eICU、WiDS、MIMIC-IV），有效发现亚群模型行为的异质性，提升了ICU死亡率等的预测表现。

Conclusion: 新框架不仅增强了对不同临床亚群特征的识别，还改善了模型的预测性能，显示出重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉模型和语言模型中，梯度反演攻击对前者展现了显著隐私威胁，但对后者由于文本的离散特性，其隐私威胁被低估，作者试图解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了名为Grab的领域特定梯度反演攻击方法，结合两种交替优化过程，包括针对层间丢弃掩码的同时优化以及针对离散优化的有效排序实现。

Result: 在实验中，Grab可以恢复高达92.9%的私有训练数据，在基准设置中性能提升了28.9%，在实际设置中提升了48.5%。

Conclusion: Grab攻击显著提高了在联邦学习模式下语言模型的隐私泄露威胁理解，加强了这一领域的认知。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

Conclusion: 论文证明了所提出的单一组合式LLM方法在多个IMAs中的高效性和灵活性，并计划公开代码供社区使用，以推动相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

Conclusion: 通过研究，论文为从有限和非完美数据中学习提供了实用解决方案，推动深度模型在真实世界数据分布上的广泛应用。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型无法从过去状态中学习气泡成核，无法自主预测沸腾动力学，特别是对流动沸腾速度场的耦合存在难度。

Method: Bubbleformer 通过因子化轴向注意力（factorized axial attention）、频率感知缩放（frequency-aware scaling）以及对热物性参数的条件进行集成，从而实现对不同流体、几何形状和操作条件的泛化。

Result: 在一个包含多流体、多构型、多边界条件的高保真数据集 BubbleML 2.0 上，Bubbleformer 实现了预测和模拟沸腾流的新基准结果。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer 能够在无需推理时依赖模拟数据的前提下，生成稳定且长期的沸腾动力学预测，涵盖成核、界面演化和传热特性。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Conclusion: Adam-PnP框架减少了超参手动调节需求，有效融合多模态噪声数据，提升了逆问题求解能力。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

*Johannes Exenberger,Sascha Ranftl,Robert Peharz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DeepPCE，通过将PCE与概率电路的理念结合，有效扩展至高维问题，并兼具准确预测和精确统计推断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PCE在高维问题中计算复杂度高、扩展性差的问题。

Method: 将经典PCE方法与概率电路相结合，通过扩展生成深度多项式混沌扩展（DeepPCE），用于高维输入空间。

Result: DeepPCE在保持PCE对统计量进行精确推断能力的同时，其预测性能可与多层感知机（MLP）媲美。

Conclusion: DeepPCE既能处理高维问题，又保留了传统PCE的统计推断优势，是一种兼具效率和准确性的模型扩展。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LAAC方法，利用大语言模型(LLMs)指导推荐系统，在提高多样性和新颖性的同时，通过轻量化策略增强性能，实验表明该方法优于当前基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前推荐系统中过度强调点击相关性的问题，满足用户对多样性和新颖性的需求，同时避免随机探索与用户兴趣不符的问题。

Method: 提出LAAC方法，引入LLMs作为参考策略建议新颖内容，轻量化策略根据系统特定数据优化推荐。此外，采用双层优化结构，在评论者和行为者网络之间进行优化。通过正则化减少对LLMs建议的过度估计，增强性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合LLMs知识和轻量化策略，显著提高推荐系统性能，为融合大语言模型的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合降阶模型，结合数据和全阶模型（FOM），用于预测时空混沌动力学。实验结果显示，该方法在数据丰富、数据稀缺以及错误参数的情况下，相较于仅数据驱动的方法，预测表现显著提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动技术在处理混沌动力学系统方面具有强大潜力，但仍需进一步开发方法整合已知物理知识（FOM）以提升预测能力。

Method: 利用自编码器找到不变流形的坐标，将FOM的向量场投影到该流形，并结合数据校正或作为贝叶斯先验更新后，采用神经常微分方程方法进行建模。

Result: 通过对Kuramoto-Sivashinsky与复杂Ginzburg-Landau方程的模拟数据测试，混合方法在各类场景（包括数据充足、数据稀缺和错误FOM参数）下均显著优于仅数据驱动的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的混合降阶模型通过结合物理知识与数据驱动方式，有效提升了时空混沌动力学的建模与预测能力，有望在更多复杂系统中推广应用。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在无需显式几何信息的情况下，成功结合数据驱动学习和符号物理方法，解决了重建和模拟弹性物体的难题。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为CDNet的对比扩散网络，旨在解决深度学习模型在处理时间序列分类中遇到的数据相似度、多模态分布和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在时间序列分类任务中表现优秀，但在处理奇异状态如类间相似性、多模态分布和噪声数据时表现下降，亟需改进。

Method: 作者开发了CDNet网络，通过学习扩散过程生成具有信息性的正负样本。与传统扩散模型不同，CDNet的重点是学习类内和类间样本间的转化，使用基于卷积神经网络的机制实现降噪与模式覆盖，同时引入不确定性加权的复合损失函数以增强模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CDNet在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上显著提升了SOTA深度学习分类器的性能，尤其是在处理噪声、相似和多模态条件下的表现。

Conclusion: CDNet成功证明可通过产生更具信息的正负样本来增强现有分类器的能力，是解决时间序列分类数据问题的有效方向。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ECHO的高效神经组合优化（NCO）求解器，专注于多车问题的异构容量车辆路径问题（MMHCVRP），旨在解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数NCO求解器集中于单车的车辆路径问题（VRP）变体，忽略了更实际的多车设置（MMHCVRP），且现有方法存在解码视野局限以及未充分考虑关键问题属性的缺陷。

Method: 论文提出了ECHO方法，包括双模态节点编码器捕捉局部拓扑关系、无参数交叉注意力机制减少解码决策短视问题，以及结合车组排列不变性和节点对称性引入数据增强策略，从而优化强化学习训练过程。

Result: 实验结果表明ECHO在不同车辆和节点数量下均优于最先进NCO求解器，并展现出良好的扩展性与分布模式泛化能力。此外，消融实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ECHO作为一个新型NCO求解器，不仅改善了解决MMHCVRP的性能，还验证了其在多样条件下的强健性及泛化能力。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种专用硬件加速器EpochCore，显著提高了SSM模型在长序列任务中的性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如RNNs、CNNs和Transformers）难以在极长序列任务中保持高精度，而SSM模型需解决计算和内存密集型问题。

Method: 设计了基于流式阵列（SA）的EpochCore硬件加速器，以及一种新型数据流ProDF，其中核心处理单元为LIMA-PE，支持传统和SSM模型的计算。

Result: EpochCore相比传统SA加速器提高了性能250倍，能效提高了45倍；相比GPU操作，在LRA数据集上延迟/推理改进约2000倍。

Conclusion: EpochCore通过硬件优化成功解决了SSM模型的计算瓶颈问题，在长序列任务中表现出色，尽管硬件面积增加。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

TL;DR: 提出MOCHA算法，通过权重切比雪夫和actor-critic框架实现探索多目标强化学习的Pareto稳定解，同时具有有限时间样本复杂性保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中多非凸奖励目标下Pareto稳定解的系统探索问题，这是一个理论与实践中尚未深入研究的领域。

Method: 提出了MOCHA算法，结合了权重切比雪夫函数和actor-critic方法，用于有保证地进行Pareto稳定解的探索，同时确保有限时间样本复杂性。

Result: 样本复杂性分析表明，MOCHA算法在寻找$\epsilon$-Pareto稳定解时，依赖于权重向量的最小值$p_{\min}$，其样本复杂性为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$。在KuaiRand离线数据集上的模拟研究表明，MOCHA的性能显著优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: MOCHA算法不仅提供了一种有效的框架来探索多目标强化学习中的Pareto最优解，还具备理论支持的有限时间样本复杂性比分。此外，它在实际数据集中表现了明显优势。

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析并揭示目前广泛使用的虚拟筛选基准LIT-PCBA存在的数据完整性问题，推动创建更可靠的数据集。

Method: 通过审计检查LIT-PCBA数据集中的数据泄漏、重复及结构冗余问题，还实施了一个基于记忆的基准测试模型。

Result: 发现数据集中存在明显问题，包括训练和验证集之间的重复、查询集中的分子泄漏，以及显著的结构冗余，导致基准测试完全失效。

Conclusion: 由于这些数据完整性问题，LIT-PCBA无法作为可靠的模型评估基准，呼吁研究者开发更严谨的数据集，并提供审计工具帮助验证。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

Conclusion: 扭矩驱动的分层重构方法有效提高了图神经网络在异质性和噪声环境下的性能，证明了其在图构造优化中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

Result: 实验表明MemShare使吞吐量提高了84.79%，同时保持甚至提升了现有缓存管理方法的准确性。

Conclusion: MemShare能够有效减少内存开销，显著提高推理吞吐量，并维持模型的推理准确性，是一种高效的缓存管理方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

Result: 实验表明两种方法在多种误差指标上超越现有基准模型。

Conclusion: PVD-Net和PVD-ONet为处理多尺度奇异摄动问题提供了一种行之有效的工具。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

Motivation: 现有扩散策略（DPs）尽管在模仿学习中效果显著，但因噪声移除步骤多导致推理时间长，且现有的知识蒸馏加速方法训练成本高。提出一种无需额外训练且推理更快速的方法势在必行。

Method: 构建基于DP编码器的专家示例向量数据库，将当前观测输入嵌入后，检索最相似的专家动作，并融入中间噪声移除步骤，以减少扩散模型推理步骤。

Result: RAGDP在不额外训练的情况下，与现有加速方法结合使用时，可提升速度与准确性之间的平衡，在加速20倍的情况下与蒸馏方法相比准确性提高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP框架为加速扩散策略推理提供了一种高效的解决方案，在无需额外训练的条件下实现更高的准确性与速度权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

TL;DR: Latte是一种适用于去中心化环境中的测试时间适配框架，通过本地内存和外部记忆体协作提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对单一领域的大量数据设计，去中心化设置（如联邦学习）下无法有效适应各客户端的分布差异。

Method: Latte采用本地内存存储自身测试数据嵌入，与通过服务器协调获取的外部记忆体（其他客户端的类原型）协作，同时结合嵌入相似性和不确定性进行本地适配。

Result: Latte在域适配与数据损坏测试中表现优异，且通信及计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte框架有效平衡了分布内与分布外客户端适配挑战，是一种在去中心化环境中性能卓越的测试时间适配方法。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)
evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior,
capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

Result: 模型在合成数据和神经记录上的实验表明，该方法能够精准恢复低维流形结构并能有效处理数据维度的增长。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在维持推理计算线性增长的同时，保留了解释性高、灵活性强等优点。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

Conclusion: DGP通过平衡不同粒度的信息摘要，成功改善了图增强LLM在欺诈检测中的性能，展示出其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Conclusion: 本文展示了PREIG如何通过结合领域知识、优化理论和深度学习解决高维非线性时间序列预测问题，提供了一种可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Conclusion: ZS-PAG框架可有效解决零样本解除学习问题，通过生成对抗样本和伪标签策略显著提高模型性能，并防止过度解除学习。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

Conclusion: RF-CRATE证明了复数域白盒模型的可行性和优越性，为无线射频感知提供了一种有效且具有解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

### [273] [Analysis of Fourier Neural Operators via Effective Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21833)
*Taeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 首次系统性地分析了傅里叶神经算子(FNO)的稳定性、泛化性及频率行为，并提出了相关理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 傅里叶神经算子虽然在高维偏微分方程中表现突出，但其稳定性、泛化性和频率行为缺乏系统分析。

Method: 利用有效场论分析，推导出层核和四点顶点的封闭递归关系，研究解析激活函数、尺度不变性及残差连接三种情况。

Result: 理论表明，非线性激活函数将频率输入与高频模式耦合，且实验验证了这种频率传递。宽网络情况下，还得到了权重初始化的显式条件，以保持输入扰动的尺度一致性。

Conclusion: 本文用理论量化了非线性如何帮助神经算子捕获非平凡特征，并指导超参数选择及解释为何尺度不变激活和残差连接能增强FNO特征学习能力。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据驱动方法难以生成具有物理意义和可解释性的模型，尤其难以准确表达系统物理动力学。提出更准确、高效的数据驱动建模方法的需求迫切。

Method: 该方法先假设一个近似的普通微分方程(ODE)一般解形式，通过样条变换线性估计ODE系数，并从中提取梯度信息构成梯度矩阵来求解线性系统的ODE系数。

Result: 通过实际案例验证发现，该方法能高准确地发现ODE模型，且无需正则化即可实现解的稀疏性，同时对噪声数据具有较高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为实验数据驱动物理现象学习提供了新的思路，尤其适用于噪声环境，其模型不仅高精度，也具有物理解释性和稀疏性优势。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a main cause of mortality globally,
accounting for 31% of all deaths. This study involves a cardiovascular disease
(CVD) dataset comprising 68,119 records to explore the influence of numerical
(age, height, weight, blood pressure, BMI) and categorical gender, cholesterol,
glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,
and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations
for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance
comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and
an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824).
Data challenges, including outliers and skewed distributions, indicate a need
for improved preprocessing to enhance predictive reliability.

Motivation: 现有方法在多态蛋白质设计上的实验成功率较低，需要一种更有效的设计策略来处理具有多个构象状态的蛋白质。

Method: 提出了DynamicMPNN模型，通过对不同构象集合的联合学习，生成能够兼容多种构象的蛋白质序列。

Result: DynamicMPNN在多状态蛋白质基准上的表现，相比ProteinMPNN，在结构归一化RMSD上提高了13%。

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN为多态蛋白质设计提供了一种高效可靠的新方法，优于现有单态设计策略。

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one
structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from
enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple
conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc
aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success
rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse
folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple
conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained
on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein
benchmark.

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level
Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA
violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we
propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为R-Stitch的新框架，通过在推理过程中在小语言模型（SLM）和大语言模型（LLM）之间进行切换，加速连锁推理的推断过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连锁推理尽管提高了问题解决能力，但引入了显著的计算开销，因此需要新的方法来降低推理延迟。

Method: R-Stitch框架基于令牌的信心水平在SLM和LLM之间切换，仅当SLM信心低于阈值时调用LLM，并避免全序列回滚。

Result: 实验表明，R-Stitch在数学推理基准上实现了推断延迟的85%的减少，同时准确性几乎未受影响。

Conclusion: R-Stitch展示了在保持效率和答案质量的同时显著加速连锁推理的潜力，为模型加速提供了实际价值。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 生成式人工智能特别是大语言模型（LLMs）正带来经济变革。研究考察了RL用于广告生成的影响，并得出其显著提升广告点击率的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式人工智能领域，研究大语言模型经后训练的经济影响，尤其RL的作用，目前尚未充分开发和量化。

Method: 通过在Meta的广告生成工具中应用RL后训练的方法（RLPF），基于广告历史表现数据设计奖励信号，调整模型。

Result: 在Facebook平台的10周A/B测试中，AdLlama模型点击率相较基于模仿学习的模型提高了6.7%，并且用户满意度表现提升。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅证明了RL后训练的高效性，为生成式AI和经济影响研究提供重要参考，还展现了RLPF的广泛适用性，可有效将潜力模型应用于实际领域。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏在生成可迁移对抗样本中的潜力，特别是在效率和效果方面的提升。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet-161作为教师模型，采用课程切换和联合优化两种蒸馏策略，训练轻量化学生模型，然后使用FG、FGS、PGD攻击生成对抗样本，测试其对黑箱目标模型(GoogLeNet)的攻击效果。

Result: 学生模型通过多教师知识蒸馏后生成的对抗样本，其攻击成功率与基于集成的基线方法相当，同时将生成时间减少至原来的六分之一。此外，还发现低温度设置和硬标签监督显著提升样本的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅可以用作模型压缩技术，还能高效提升黑箱对抗攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Conclusion: 本文连接了数据驱动学习与库存管理中的分析洞察，为实际的库存管理问题提供了强适用性解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Conclusion: 使用正交多项式（如勒让德多项式）进行权重参数化，在模型表达能力和训练效率之间实现了良好的平衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂的预测环境提供了一种简单却有效的提升泛化能力的机制。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

Conclusion: iHOMER有效解决在线多标签学习中的挑战，以其强健性能证明其在动态、多标签分类任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

Method: 设计了一种新的循环神经网络架构，结合传统隐式状态与显性Hebbian记忆矩阵，并通过稀疏的注意力驱动机制进行记忆的检索与回溯，同时追踪动态Hebbian轨迹以可视化记忆形成过程。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10及WikiText-103等任务上的实验结果表明，ENN在准确性和泛化性能上与经典的RNN、GRU和LSTM架构相当，同时增强了显性记忆模块的解释性。

Conclusion: ENN通过模拟生物学中的记忆形成机制，将可解释性与性能相结合，为更具解释性和鲁棒性的深度学习模型的发展提供了可能性。

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

Abstract: The capacitated arc routing problem with time-dependent service costs
(CARPTDSC) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that arises from
winter gritting applications. CARPTDSC has two main challenges about time
consumption. First, it is an NP-hard problem. Second, the time-dependent
service costs of tasks require frequent evaluations during the search process,
significantly increasing computational effort. These challenges make it
difficult for existing algorithms to perform efficient searches, often
resulting in limited efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
knowledge-guided memetic algorithm with golden section search and negatively
correlated search (KGMA-GN), where two knowledge-guided strategies are
introduced to improve search efficiency. First, a knowledge-guided
initialization strategy (KGIS) is proposed to generate high-quality initial
solutions to speed up convergence. Second, a knowledge-guided small-step-size
local search strategy (KGSLSS) is proposed to filter out invalid moves, thereby
reducing unnecessary evaluations and saving the computation time. Experimental
results on five benchmark test sets, including both small- and larger-scale
instances, demonstrate that KGMA-GN achieves higher search efficiency than the
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the ablation study further confirms that
the knowledge-guided local search operators in KGSLSS can significantly reduce
runtime compared to traditional operators, especially for the knowledge-guided
swap operator, which achieves more than a tenfold improvement in speed.
