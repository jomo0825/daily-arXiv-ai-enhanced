### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RetinexDual的新方法，应用于超高清图像修复，结合了空间与频率域的优势，效果显著优于近期方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统方法在超高清图像修复中的信息丢失和降解区域局限性问题，提出解决方案。

Method: 基于Retinex理论，设计了两个互补子网络：SAMBA用于细节还原，FIA用于色彩与亮度校正，结合了空间和频率域操作的优点。

Result: 在降雨、去模糊、去雾和低光图像增强四个任务上，RetinexDual在定性和定量结果上均超越了近期方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过不同分支的独特设计与组件，嵌合了空间与频率域的优势，为超高清图像修复提供了卓越的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ENTRep，旨在解决耳鼻喉科内镜图像分析中的分类、视觉和文本检索难题。该数据集包括具备越英双语叙述的专家标注数据，并定义了三个基准任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化的内镜图像分析在耳鼻喉科仍欠发展，现有数据集缺乏支持细粒度分析和多模态检索的能力。

Method: 通过ENTRep基准数据集整合细粒度的区域分类、图像和文本检索任务，提供双语标注及标准化评估流程。

Result: 报告了基准任务的性能评估结果，并分享了表现最佳团队的案例分析及相关见解。

Conclusion: ENTRep为耳鼻喉内镜分析领域提供了新型工具，以促进自动化分析的研究和临床实践。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了共识导向的遮蔽蒸馏框架（CoMAD），通过蒸馏多个SOTA自监督视觉变换器的知识，将其整合到一个轻量化的ViT-Tiny学生模型中，生成紧凑、有力的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督学习方法多独立预训练，忽视相辅相成的信息，导致资源约束环境下部署困难，该研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出的CoMAD框架利用不对称遮蔽策略，将三种教师模型（MAE、MoCo v3和iBOT）的特性提取并融合，并通过联合共识门控权重教师输出，由点和全局级别的KL散度联合训练学生模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，CoMAD的ViT-Tiny模型达到了75.4%的Top-1准确率，比之前的SOTA高0.4%。在ADE20K和MS-COCO数据集上的密集预测传输任务中，也取得了新的SOTA表现。

Conclusion: CoMAD框架有效地统一了多种自监督模型的知识，提出了一种高效且实用的新型蒸馏方法，适合有限资源环境下的部署。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需重构的基于注意力扩散模型的异常检测方法（RADAR），在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集的检测指标上均优于现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽在异常检测中取得良好效果，但基于重构的方法存在计算开销大、对复杂模式效果有限以及中间噪声级别难选等问题。

Method: 提出RADAR方法，不再依赖图像重构，直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，从而提升检测精度和计算效率。

Result: RADAR在MVTec-AD数据集的F1分数提高了7%，在3D打印材料数据集提高了13%，性能全面超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: RADAR方法在异常检测任务中展现了较大优势，尤其是在精度和效率方面，适合多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究利用事件相机和深度学习实现高精度和经济型眼球跟踪，应用于VR/AR设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决眼动追踪需要高成本高速度相机的问题，通过发展低成本、高性能算法用于消费电子领域。

Method: 采用CNN_LSTM模型对事件相机输入进行处理，预测眼球中心位置（x，y）。

Result: CNN_LSTM模型达到大约81%的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出了一种解释性高、成本低的深度学习算法，并计划在未来通过LRP方法进一步提升模型性能和解释性。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KAN）和Lucas多项式激活函数的3D人体运动预测模型LuKAN，展示了其在精度和计算效率上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，本研究提出一种新方法以解决此问题。

Method: 使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕获关节依赖性，核心为使用Lucas多项式参数化的KAN层的时间依赖学习，最后通过逆小波变换重建运动序列。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验结果显示，与现有强基线方法相比，模型在定量和定性评估中表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: LuKAN模型结构紧凑，通过Lucas多项式的线性递归实现了高计算效率，且能生成时间上连贯的预测。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估框架VER-Bench，专注评估MLLMs对细粒度视觉证据的提取与复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准无法充分测试MLLMs在分析视觉微小细节和复杂推理方面的能力，需设计更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过VER-Bench框架，提供包含374个设计问题的测试集，并结合可视化线索与关联推理进行评估，涵盖多个推理类别。

Result: VR-Bench表明现有模型在提取和利用细微视觉线索以及构建基于证据的推理方面仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 需增强MLLMs在精细视觉证据提取、整合与推理方面的能力，以实现更真实的人类分析水平。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAMM框架，通过多模态查询和双流注意力机制提升目标检测的准确性和效率，并在四个基准上取得SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于Transformer的目标检测中固定查询和稠密注意力导致的在遮挡、精细定位和计算效率上的问题。

Method: 引入多模态查询（包括外观、位置和随机学习查询）和双流交叉注意力模块来分别优化语义和空间特征。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准上达到了最先进的性能（AP和召回率）。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制能够有效提升目标检测的精度和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨在线视频内容中仇恨言论检测中的时间粒度问题，并通过精细化的方法分析仇恨片段，揭示了标签噪声对模型分类信心和决策边界的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态仇恨视频检测方法大多依赖粗粒度的视频标注，忽视了仇恨内容的时间颗粒度，导致存在较大的标签噪声问题。

Method: 对仇恨视频数据集HateMM和MultiHateClip进行了基于时间戳的精细化处理，裁剪出明确的仇恨片段，并进行对这些片段的探索性分析及控制实验。

Result: 研究表明，粗糙的时间戳标注会显著影响模型决策边界及分类信心，同时也揭示了仇恨言论表达的上下文依赖性及时间连续性。

Conclusion: 提出了多模态仇恨视频检测中需要时间感知模型及基准的需求，从而改善检测的鲁棒性与可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Highlight-TTA方法，通过测试时动态适应视频特性提升视频关键片段检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法无法很好地泛化到所有测试视频，原因在于固定模型未能针对每个测试视频的独特特点进行适配。

Method: 引入Highlight-TTA，在测试时通过辅助任务联合优化并动态适应每个测试视频的特性。

Result: 通过三种主流模型和三种基准数据集的实验，证明引入Highlight-TTA显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA能够让现有方法更好地泛化并提高在新视频上的表现，是视频关键片段检测的有效改进。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方法，通过校准令牌对单目深度估计器（FMDEs）进行分布对齐，使其无需重新训练或微调即可扩展到鱼眼图像上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FMDEs虽然在大规模的透视图像上接受过训练，但在相机标定参数变化下（例如内参、失真）表现出协变量偏移，导致深度估计误差。

Method: 方法提出了一种轻量级的校准令牌机制，通过自监督训练，将透视图像被重新校准为鱼眼图像，并在训练过程中强制保持两者估计间的一致性，避免了以往重新投影或重校准方法带来的负面影响。

Result: 在室内外场景的多种FMDEs实验中，使用单一校准令牌的情况下优于现有的最新方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入校准令牌，成功实现了鱼眼图像的深度估计扩展，同时避免了传统方法的弊端。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于ImageNet 2012数据集的前馈神经网络，模型表现卓越但因数据集中的双标签问题未达到100%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在大规模图像数据集（ImageNet 2012）上提升分类模型的准确率。

Method: 采用前馈人工神经网络，通过一种新训练方法，将模型参数精确度提升至4位小数，共322,430,160参数。

Result: 最终模型在ImageNet 2012上的准确率达98.3%，Top-1准确率为99.69%，单批次平均完美分类的标签数为285.9个。

Conclusion: 提出的神经网络模型精度极高，但由于数据集中的双标签问题，未能达到100%准确率。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM是一个增强条件化提示学习的框架，通过引入掩码图像建模改进现有视觉语言模型的泛化能力，同时无需对原有架构做出重大改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型虽然在零样本学习中表现出色，但在适配新任务时需要大量资源，同时现有的提示学习方法易在已知类别上过拟合，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出ProMIM框架，将掩码图像建模与现有视觉语言模型的提示学习相结合，通过对可见图像块进行掩码，并利用这些表示生成更加鲁棒的实例条件化提示，同时保持较低的计算成本。

Result: 实验证明，在零样本和少样本分类任务上，ProMIM能够在现有方法中持续提高泛化性能。

Conclusion: ProMIM是一个高效且轻量级的解决方案，可应用于真实世界的视觉语言应用中，显著提升分类任务的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRKT方法通过增强对象检测和关系预测，解决了传统外部检测器在动态场景关系图生成中的不足，并在Action Genome数据集上取得了领先表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督动态场景关系图生成方法依赖于静态外部检测器，但该检测器在动态且需要关系感知的场景中表现不佳，亟需改进对象定位与关系预测精度。

Method: 提出了一种名为TRKT的方法，包括：1)关系感知知识挖掘，通过类别特定的注意力图和帧间光流增强策略，提升运动感知与关系感知能力；2)双流融合模块，将注意力图融入外部检测器的结果，优化对象定位与提议置信度。

Result: TRKT方法在Action Genome数据集上表现出色，实现了弱监督动态场景关系图生成的最新性能。

Conclusion: TRKT成功解决了弱监督动态场景关系图生成中的外部检测缺陷问题，证明了关系感知和运动感知增强技术的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the

*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AdvDINO的域对抗自监督学习框架，通过引入梯度反转层减少域偏差，显著提升在生物医学成像中的鲁棒性和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督学习在面对域偏差时的鲁棒性问题，尤其适用于生物医学成像中数据源差异带来的挑战。

Method: 提出基于DINOv2架构的域对抗自监督学习框架，结合梯度反转层来实现域不变特征学习，并应用于非小细胞肺癌患者的多重免疫荧光数据分析。

Result: 模型成功减少切片特异性偏差，分类出了具有不同蛋白质组学特征和预后意义的表型聚类，并在预测生存模型中表现优于非对抗性方法。

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学成像场景，还能够推广到辐射成像、遥感和自动驾驶等领域，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HOW-Seg，这是一个面向开放世界点云语义分割（OW-Seg）的新型人机协作框架，通过少量人工标注实现高效的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖资源密集型的增量学习或密集标注支持数据，限制了其实用性，需要一种更加高效和实用的解决方案。

Method: 提出HOW-Seg通过在查询数据上直接构建类原型避免原型偏差，引入分层原型消歧机制优化模糊原型，并应用CRF模型进一步优化标签分配，同时结合人类反馈逐步提高分割质量。

Result: 在使用稀疏注释（如每类点击一次）时，HOW-Seg达到了或超过了GFS-Seg的性能。当使用更高性能的骨干网络和更多标注时，在S3DIS和ScanNetv2数据集上取得了显著高于替代方案的分割性能。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg提供了一种资源高效且实用的框架，即使使用少量人工标注，也能够实现对基础类和新类点云的高质量语义分割。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

*Zhihao Guo,Peng Wang,Zidong Chen,Xiangyu Kong,Yan Lyu,Guanyu Gao,Liangxiu Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的3D高斯分割方法，通过自适应调整高斯的权重来提高稀疏视图场景下的新颖视图合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯分割方法中，高斯权重相等，导致稀疏视图场景下容易过拟合。

Method: 引入学习不确定性，通过差分更新高斯不透明度，并结合软差分丢弃正则化，将不确定性转化为控制最终高斯渲染的连续丢弃概率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图3D合成中优于现有方法，例如在MipNeRF 360数据集上，PSNR提升了3.27%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持管线完整性的同时，提高了渲染质量，尤其在稀疏视图场景中表现显著优越。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Result: 实验表明，改进的框架实现了更优的质量/成本权衡，与现有技术相比，保持了更高的平均精度（mAP）和召回率。

Conclusion: 可变大小和帧率的帆布框显著提升了目标检测系统在边缘设备上的表现效果，同时解决了实时性与计算资源之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODEC是一种新的单步扩散图像压缩模型，解决了传统扩散压缩模型解码缓慢和保真度差的问题，在速率失真感知性能和解码速度上明显优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散图像压缩方法表现出色，但解码速度慢且保真度差，因此需要一种既能保持高效解码又能提高保真度的新方法。

Method: 提出SODEC模型，通过预训练的基于VAE的模型产生具有丰富信息的潜变量，采用单步解码代替多步去噪过程；引入保真度指导模块以提升输出图像的保真度，并设计了速率退火训练策略以适应极低比特率的训练。

Result: SODEC显著优于现有方法，在率失真感知性能上表现更出色，在解码速度上提升超过20倍。

Conclusion: SODEC提供了一种高效且高保真的图像压缩解决方案，同时大幅提高了解码速度，具有显著的研究与应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的深度补全框架，通过利用深度基础模型有效提升模型的健壮性，无需大规模训练。在16个OOD场景中对模型进行了评估，其表现超越现有方法，并且代码开放供研究使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全模型依赖有限的、精心准备的数据集，但在分布外场景（OOD）中表现不稳定。因此，需要一种能够增强模型健壮性的方法。

Method: 提出了一种结合深度基础模型的深度补全框架，从RGB图像中提取结构和语义上下文，指导稀疏深度信息传播。设计了一个无参数的双空间传播方法，结合3D与2D传播以保持几何结构和局部一致性。同时引入可学习的修正模块逐步调整预测深度。

Result: 框架在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上进行训练，并在16个其他数据集上的OOD评估中表现优异，超越了现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了深度补全任务在分布外场景中的鲁棒性，并展示了深度基础模型在此类任务中的潜力，同时无需大规模的数据训练。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的预训练视觉语言模型在未标注领域的迁移性能表现欠佳，主要受限于模态之间的自然差异(模态间隙)。

Method: 提出了一个模态分离框架，将模态特定和模态不变成分从特征中分离出来，并在测试时通过自适应权重融合。此外，设计了一种模态差异度量方法对样本进行分类并采用针对性处理。

Result: 所提方法在不同基线和数据集上的性能提升达到9%，同时具有9倍的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 通过统一模态处理和高效的提示调优方法，有效克服了模态间差异对跨领域适应性能的限制。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Method: 使用基于Vision Transformer的自编码器，结合Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 模拟快权重，通过熟悉训练研究全局情境敏感性。

Result: 熟悉训练使自注意力机制完成神经回路相似的流形变换；调整早期层和顶层潜在表示一致性；扩展记忆图像情境中的自注意范围；LoRA快权重大幅增强这些效应。

Conclusion: 熟悉训练可引入全局敏感性至网络早期层，快慢结合的权重结构为研究大脑快速全局学习提供可能的计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的Re-ID任务尤其是遮挡Re-ID面临预训练视觉-语言模型难以处理细粒度属性信息的挑战，特别是部分遮挡或有细微差异的行人。

Method: 提出AG-ReID框架，通过两阶段流程：1）生成捕获视觉特点的属性伪标签；2）结合全局和细粒度属性信息进行特征提取。

Result: 在多个常用Re-ID数据集上取得了最先进的结果，在遮挡和细微属性区分场景中展现显著改进，同时在标准Re-ID场景中实现了具有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: AG-ReID框架成功利用了预训练模型的能力，无需额外数据或注释，就能提升在遮挡及难以区分场景中的Re-ID表现，展现提升潜力。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了用于视频持续学习的CRAM方法，通过存储压缩视频代码（嵌入向量）代替原始输入，显著降低内存需求并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频持续学习方法中存储和内存受限的问题，支持处理长视频和连续流数据。

Method: 提出CRAM方法，在线训练视频压缩器以存储视频代码，并引入代码刷新机制解决遗忘问题，将旧版本解压重新压缩至新版本。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700大规模基准数据集上进行评估，方法实现了低于2GB存储的数千视频，并且优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CRAM方法显著减少视频持续学习的内存占用，同时提高性能，为应对自然的分布变化提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在面对医疗影像时存在领域泛化能力不足的问题，主要原因是医疗图像中存在多种领域偏移现象，如设备差异、操作伪影等，导致模型在未知领域上的表现欠佳。

Method: 提出了MCDRL框架：第一步利用CLIP的跨模态能力，通过文本提示识别病灶区域并构建表示领域偏移的混杂词典；第二步设计因果干预网络，利用该词典剔除领域相关变异的影响，同时保留对分割任务至关重要的解剖结构信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，MCDRL在分割精度和泛化能力方面均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCDRL框架提出了一种有效的使用因果推断解决医疗影像领域泛化问题的新方法，为零样本学习和医学图像分割提供了强有力的支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Conclusion: 现有质量评估方法在AI-UGC上的表现仍有改进空间，提供的AU-IQA数据集有助于推动这一领域的进一步研究和进步。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，早期诊断和准确的治疗对于提高病患的生存率至关重要。然而，传统的SOAP医学记录手工生成过程耗时费力，导致医师工作负担加重。

Method: 提出skin-SOAP，一个弱监督的多模态框架，能够利用病变图像和稀疏的临床文本生成完善的SOAP医学记录，同时引入新的评估指标MedConceptEval和Clinical Coherence Score (CCS)。

Result: skin-SOAP在多个关键临床相关性指标上的表现可媲美GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro。

Conclusion: 该方法能够降低对人工标注的依赖，提供可扩展且有临床依据的文档生成方案，有助于减轻医师负担，实现高效的医学文档生成。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

Method: 提出了基于 Cuboidal 分层划分的统计测量的分析型、无需训练的指标SCSSIM，用以量化SCS的保留情况，克服了现有评估方法的不足。

Result: 实验表明，SCSSIM对非组成性失真高度不变且对组成性失真表现出良好的单调下降特性，能准确反映SCS的变化。

Conclusion: SCSSIM优于现有的结构评估指标，可作为开发和评估生成性AI模型的一种不可或缺的工具，确保场景组成完整性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

TL;DR: 研究提出一种名为HAMoBE的框架，用于视频中的行人再识别，通过多层次特征提取和专门化专家模块提升匹配准确性，实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频场景下的行人再识别在监控和安全领域至关重要，但现有方法未能充分提取和选择查询-库对中最具辨别力的特征。

Method: 设计了HAMoBE框架，通过预训练大模型（如CLIP）的多层特征提取，独立建模外观、静态体型和动态步态，还引入了双输入决策门控网络自适应调整专家权重。

Result: 在MEVID等基准上测试，显示主要性能指标如Rank-1准确率提高了13%。

Conclusion: HAMoBE框架通过模拟人的感知机制有效提升了视频行人再识别的准确性，证明了专门化特征集成的可行性。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Motivation: 现有的多模态语言模型在处理复杂文档中的细粒度信息提取任务时能力不足。

Method: 引入NiM基准测试作为测试任务，并提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能块选择和高斯注意机制增强模型在文档搜索任务中的能力。

Result: 实验证明当前MLLM在细粒度文档理解任务上的局限性，同时表明Spot-IT方法在复杂布局文档的精细细节提取上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT改进了MLLM在复杂文档的高精度细节处理能力，尤其适合需要精准信息提取的场景。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Conclusion: DualMat框架通过双路径机制和新型技术显著优化了PBR材质的估算能力，可集成至图像到3D的流程中。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

Motivation: 解决持续语义分割任务中，学习新类时的遗忘问题，通过减少类别间的干扰，优化知识保留与更新的平衡。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段框架：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器结合LoRA进行类特定信息编码；第二阶段利用Segment Anything Model (SAM)生成精准分割掩码，实现新旧类别知识共享。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法在多个挑战性任务中达到了最新的性能水平。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS有效改善了持续语义分割任务中保留性与适应性的平衡，提出的方法具有高效性与鲁棒性，具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Result: 针对图像上色任务探索了新的方法，并基于改进模型进行了实验对比。

Conclusion: 提出结合分类任务和对抗学习的新方法，为图像自动上色任务提供了新的角度和理论支持。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup是一种无需辅助面部控制组件的高保真、身份一致的化妆转移框架，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化妆迁移方法因依赖复杂的损失函数或额外模块导致效果欠佳，FLUX-Makeup旨在解决这些问题以实现更优结果。

Method: 以FLUX-Kontext为基础，通过RefLoRAInjector模块解耦化妆特征路径，并引入新数据生成管道以改进训练监督。

Result: 实现了最先进的化妆转移性能，展示了在多种场景中的强大鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup无需额外模块即可实现高质量化妆转移，并在实际应用中展现出广阔前景。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 当前病理基础模型存在训练上下文多样且不透明的问题，导致其在应用中的可泛化性和透明性受到限制。

Method: 提出AdaFusion框架，将多个病理基础模型的特征进行压缩和对齐，并利用轻量级注意力机制根据组织表型上下文动态融合这些特征。

Result: 在治疗响应预测、肿瘤分级和空间基因表达推断三个实际基准上，AdaFusion通过分类和回归任务表现超越单一模型，并提供了模型的生物语义专长解释。

Conclusion: AdaFusion成功地整合了异构病理基础模型，实现了性能提升的同时增强了模型特定归纳偏差的理解能力。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

TL;DR: PoseGen是一种新框架，可以从单一参考图像和驱动姿势序列生成任意长度的视频，克服了现有扩散模型的短视频限制和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型难以生成具有身份保持和动作准确性的长视频，且常局限于短时视频，PoseGen旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出一种创新的LoRA微调策略，在令牌级别注入主题外观以保持身份信息，同时在通道级别进行姿势条件控制；采用交替分段生成的方法，通过共享的KV缓存机制和特定的转换过程实现背景一致性和时间连贯性。

Result: PoseGen在身份忠实度、姿势准确性及生成无伪影视频的能力上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen有效生成长时间、一致性强且无伪影的视频，是现有视频生成技术的重要突破。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的方法SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty），旨在解决少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）中数据不足导致的表现退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到实际应用中的数据隐私限制和高获取成本，传统类增量学习对训练数据的充分性假设不现实，这导致了显著的性能下降。

Method: SMP方法通过在参数高效微调中整合不同阶段的边距惩罚来增强前向兼容性，包括MIAM机制和MPCC策略。MIAM用于基础任务训练，通过两组低秩适配器分别优化基础类可区分性和新类泛化性，随后进行自适应融合；MPCC则用于增量任务，通过边距惩罚校准分类器的决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200数据集上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL任务中取得了最先进的性能，同时在基础类和新类之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: SMP不仅提升了少样本类增量学习的性能，还解决了基础类可区分性和新类泛化性的平衡问题，是一种有效的创新方法。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

Motivation: 解决现有多实例学习在病理图像分类中推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包括DMIN和DB-LIPN两大组件，通过自蒸馏和不对称蒸馏的两步训练流程，筛选出相关的低分辨率斑块用于后续高效推理；并首次在计算病理学中引入CKA分类器。

Result: AHDMIL在多个数据集上显示了优异性能，如在Camelyon16数据集上的准确率提升5.3%，推理加速最高2.1倍，AUC等性能指标稳定提升。

Conclusion: AHDMIL成功改善了多实例学习的分类精度和推理效率，为病理图像的高效分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Conclusion: 通过整合潜在表达与视觉细节，该框架可有效提升视觉定位任务的准确性，为相关研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Result: 在数据有限的情况下，FedGIN在MRI测试集上的3D Dice分数上提升12%-18%；在完整数据情况下，FedGIN实现接近中心化的性能，相比单一模态基线在Dice得分上提升高达30%。

Conclusion: FedGIN证明了其在隐私限制下的多模态分割的强大泛化能力，特别是在数据有限情况下的优越性能，展示了其在医学影像领域的潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Motivation: 解决任意尺度图像超分辨率过程中的几何模式旋转和变形问题，避免高分辨率恢复图像中的伪影。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Result: X-MoGen在标准数据集上表现优于当前最先进方法，具有更好的跨物种泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了文本驱动跨物种动作生成的领域，为虚拟现实、动画及机器人技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: PhysPatch方法展现了理论与应用兼备的优势，为自动驾驶场景提供了一种具有物理可行性和适用性的攻击实现途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Result: 在通用多目标跟踪基准上的大量实验验证了该框架的竞争力。

Conclusion: MTT通过增强轨迹生成和关联能力，在复杂场景中提升了多目标跟踪方法的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: SPA++通过图对齐方法显著提升了不同情景下的领域适配性能，为复杂分布下的应用提供了有效的方法。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了EndoMatcher，一种通过大规模、多领域数据预训练的内镜图像匹配方法，专注于解决内镜图像匹配中的视觉条件困难和数据稀缺性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内镜图像匹配在机器人辅助任务（如3D重建和导航）中至关重要，但因弱纹理、大视角变化及稀缺标注数据使得该领域面临挑战。

Method: 提出使用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互模块实现稳健的特征对应学习，同时构建了包含多个域的Endo-Mix6数据集，并引入渐进式多目标训练策略，以平衡学习稳定性和跨领域的泛化能力。

Result: EndoMatcher在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上的匹配内点数分别提升140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上的匹配方向预测准确性（MDPA）提高9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在零样本场景下，能够在复杂的内镜图像条件下实现高效的致密特征匹配，为机器人辅助手术任务提供了可靠的支持。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VFlowOpt的视觉-语言模型（LMM）令牌裁剪框架，能够在减少计算成本的同时维持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LMM模型利用大量视觉令牌捕捉细粒度视觉信息，但此令牌冗余带来高计算成本。现有令牌裁剪方法性能下降较大，缺乏高效策略。

Method: 提出VFlowOpt框架，通过重要性地图计算、渐进裁剪模块和回收机制优化令牌裁剪策略，并利用视觉信息流引导调整超参数，减少信息丢失。

Result: 实验表明，VFlowOpt可裁剪90%的视觉令牌，同时将KV-Cache内存需求减少89%，推理速度提升至3.8倍，而性能无明显下降。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt实现了更高效的视觉令牌裁剪，显著降低计算成本，为不同LMM提供了更优的裁剪策略。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨域泛化和数据隐私问题上存在局限性，迫切需要无需源域数据的CD-FSS方法。

Method: 提出TSAA机制用于调整特征提取器，结合VVEA模块对图像特征进行对齐及TVEA模块利用文本先验进行跨模态适配，最终通过融合生成分割掩码。

Result: 在四个跨域数据集上，方法在1-shot和5-shot设置下分别提升了2.18%和4.11%的分割准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法无源跨域适配能力显著，解决了数据隐私问题，是CD-FSS领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack框架结合推理能力和语言生成显著提升追踪性能，并提供了相关代码和新数据集，推进了视觉-语言追踪任务的发展。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen是首个支持多车辆任意视点可控图像生成的方法，为自动驾驶等领域提供了新型解决方案。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial

two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies

trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Conclusion: 研究不仅有助于了解当前技术，还给出了未来发展和改进的建议，有助于引导后续研究。

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Motivation: 解决现存方法中计算成本高的缺点，并优化3D高斯特征场的构造效率。

Method: 通过快速多视图特征融合生成初始高斯场；引入基于特征分布训练的自编码器；采用自适应稀疏化方法删除冗余高斯并优化特征场。

Result: 与传统3DGS相比，仅使用5%的高斯数量即可获得具有竞争力的3D特征场。

Conclusion: 新方法能够显著减少计算成本，简化高斯特征场，同时保持几何细节和特征分布的高质量表示。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Motivation: 针对多模态大语言模型在低资源语言环境中的表现不足，旨在提升其语言能力和文化基础。

Method: 提出了双源策略，分别从文化和语言两个角度收集数据；引入MELLA数据集，结合母语网络alt-text和模型生成字幕。

Result: 实验表明，在MELLA上微调后，多个低资源语言的模型性能均有提升，能够生成更“厚实”的描述。

Conclusion: MELLA的数据策略有效增强了模型的语言能力和文化知识，为服务低资源语言用户提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外与可见光图像融合方法因缺乏场景的深度语义理解，常常无法保留关键目标，同时融合过程会引入伪影和细节丢失，影响图像质量及任务表现。

Method: 方法利用SAM生成的高质量语义掩模作为显式先验，通过一个两阶段条件扩散模型优化融合过程：首先进行初步多模态特征融合，然后使用语义掩模与初步融合图像驱动扩散模型的粗到细去噪生成。

Result: 实验表明，SGDFuse在主观和客观评估以及下游任务适配性上均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SGDFuse通过显式语义指导和高保真融合，解决了图像融合中的核心挑战，表现优异并提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理复杂的动态户外环境中4D LiDAR数据方面存在不足，主要由于高质量、特定模态的注释不足以及缺乏能够应对其高维特性的MLLM架构。

Method: 本文开发了B4DL基准测试，提出了一种可扩展的数据生成管道，并设计了一个新型MLLM模型，能够直接处理原始4D LiDAR数据并将其与语言理解关联。

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合4D LiDAR数据和语言理解的潜力，通过新的基准与模型提升了对动态环境的感知和推理能力，为多模态学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

TL;DR: Uni-CoT是一种统一的链式推理框架，实现了多模态推理在视觉-语言任务中的应用，表现出SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉状态转换建模和多模态推理方面的局限性，尤其体现在计算成本高和架构分裂的视觉轨迹不连贯问题。

Method: 提出了两层推理范式：宏观层面进行任务规划，微观层面执行子任务；结合图像-文本监督和多任务目标的结构化训练模式。

Result: 在WISE、RISE、KRIS基准测试中的表现达到SOTA水平，且具有强泛化能力，仅需8张80GB A100显卡完成训练。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT框架为多模态推理问题提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波引导的双频率编码（WGDF）方法，通过频域建模提高遥感影像变化检测的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的变化检测方法多依赖空间域建模，特征表示的多样性有限，难以检测微小变化区域。因此，探索频域特征建模以增强边缘变化感知的潜力。

Method: 提出 WGDF 方法，利用离散小波变换（DWT）将输入图像分解为高频和低频分量。高频分量侧重于局部细节，采用 DFFE 和 FDID 模块增强边缘表示和细粒度变化；低频分量侧重于全局结构，利用Transformer和PCDM模块逐渐优化变化区域。最终高频与低频特征融合，以统一局部敏感性和全局可分性。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF 能有效减少边缘模糊性，且检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合高低频特征，成功解决了现有变化检测方法中存在的边缘模糊问题，实验验证了其优越的性能和潜力。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法依赖大量像素级标注数据的局限性，提出利用模型多次预测的空间重叠模式作为隐式置信信号。

Method: 提出GUI-RC方法，基于空间投票网格识别模型一致性较高的区域，并通过GUI-RCPO将一致性模式转化为奖励，实现无监督下的强化学习优化。

Result: GUI-RC在ScreenSpot基准测试中将Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct的准确率从80.11%提升到83.57%；GUI-RCPO进一步提升到85.14%。

Conclusion: 通过提出的无监督技术展示了测试时尺度调整和强化学习在GUI grounding任务中的潜力，有助于实现更强健和高效的数据利用。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前PPAT草图分析费时且依赖心理学家经验，难以规模化应用，因此需要开发自动化识别方法支持心理健康评估。

Method: 开发了一种基于视觉-语义和大型语言模型（LLM）的抑郁评估方法(VS-LLM)，通过分析PPAT草图的颜色使用和空间利用等整体特征进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，与心理学家传统评估相比，VS-LLM方法在抑郁评估上效率提高了17.6%。

Conclusion: VS-LLM在PPAT草图的自动化分析和心理健康评估中展现出高效性，促进了PPAT草图元素识别相关的心理评估研究。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: CoCAViT在保持高效性的同时，实现了小模型在跨领域任务上的性能改进，验证了设计的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG有效地将结构化的多模态知识整合进生成流程，大幅提高知识驱动型VQA的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

Result: 实验表明，与基线方法相比，该方法在目标检测任务中具有优势，不仅不丧失原有的零样本能力，还提升了对于新目标和细粒度目标的检测性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于TI的方法能够在显著减少计算需求的同时成功扩展VLM词汇，从而实现高效的开放词汇目标检测。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Junyu Zhou,Yuyang Huang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Ziyang Zheng,Nuowen Kan,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D Gabor Splatting (3DGabSplat)，解决3DGS在高频细节和效率上的局限性，实现更高质量的实时渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然实现了高保真实时渲染，但其基于高斯分布的原理无法有效表示高频细节，同时存在效率和内存限制。

Method: 提出了一种新的3D Gabor原始单元，融合多方向3D频率响应，通过整合多频率的Gabor核形式滤波器组，从而增强对3D细节的捕获。此外，设计了基于CUDA的高效栅格化工具，及频率自适应机制，用于优化原始单元的联合运行。

Result: 实验结果表明，3DGabSplat在实际和合成场景中均优于3DGS及其变体，性能上提升明显，例如PSNR可提升至1.35dB，同时减少了原始单元数量及内存消耗。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat能够无缝整合到现有3DGS框架中，在提高渲染质量的同时提升效率，适合作为高效的插件解决方案。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PriorRG 提出了一种新颖的胸部 X 光报告生成框架，通过两阶段训练管道，利用患者特定的先验知识来生成更准确和流畅的报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多仅基于单张图像生成报告，忽略了患者特定的先验知识（例如临床背景和近期图像），导致无法充分捕捉诊断意图或疾病进展。

Method: 方法包括两阶段：1）先验引导的对比预训练，借助临床背景提升空间和时间特征提取；2）利用先验感知的粗到细解码器，整合患者特定的先验知识生成报告。

Result: 实验表明 PriorRG 在 MIMIC-CXR 和 MIMIC-ABN 数据集上均优于现有方法，分别提升了 3.6% BLEU-4 和 3.8% F1，以及 5.9% BLEU-1。

Conclusion: PriorRG 模仿临床工作流程，有效利用患者特定的先验知识，生成更具诊断意义和流畅的胸部 X 光报告。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc 通过切片图像和几何约束显著提高了跨视角定位的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨视角定位方法通常只输出相机姿态，缺乏多余观测数据以进行可靠性验证。

Method: 提出Slice-Loc方法，将查询图像分割为子图像，独立估计每个子图像的3自由度姿态，同时通过几何刚性公式和误报警数估算模型进行可靠性验证与错误过滤。

Result: Slice-Loc将误差超过10m的比例降低至3%以下，显著提高定位精度和故障检测能力，在DReSS数据集上的平均定位误差从4.47 m减少到1.86 m，方向误差从3.42°降低到1.24°。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc创新性地通过多冗余观测和可靠性验证提升跨视角定位性能，为智能车辆在GNSS受限环境中的离线自定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Motivation: 目前医疗影像报告生成方法通常忽略了器官之间的细致关系，本文针对这一问题提出改进方案，缓解放射科医生工作量问题。

Method: 采用分层图注意网络CT-GRAPH，将解剖区域结构化为图，并结合全局特征、器官级特征以及大语言模型进行报告生成。

Result: 在CT-RATE胸部CT数据集上，CT-GRAPH方法在F1分数上相较于现有最先进方法提升了7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH以其分层结构和图注意力机制，为医疗影像报告生成任务提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合可变形注意机制优化了空间结构的捕捉能力，实现了病理图像分析的性能突破。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于掩码生成Transformer模型在处理文本到图像生成任务的难点，尤其是属性绑定和文本-图像对齐的组合生成问题。

Method: 提出了一种无需额外训练的方法UNCAGE，通过利用注意力图来优先解开清晰代表单个对象的标记，从而提升生成的组合准确性。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准和指标上的定量和定性评估中表现出一致的改进，且几乎不增加推断的计算成本。

Conclusion: UNCAGE证明了在不增加显著推断开销的情况下，通过对比注意力引导可以提升基于掩码生成Transformer的文本到图像生成的效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at
https://github.com/furiosa-ai/uncage.

Motivation: 现有的面部识别系统易受到后门攻击，恶意者可以通过植入特定触发器（如贴纸、化妆或图案面罩）操控模型，进而执行身份冒充，对系统安全性造成严重威胁。现有防御机制在识别和修正中毒样本时存在精度不足以及数据效用受损的问题。

Method: 提出TrueBiometric方法，结合多个最先进的视觉语言模型，采用多数投票机制检测中毒样本，并使用有针对性的校准噪声进行修复以保持数据的清洁性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric相较于现有方法，更实用、更精确且更高效，为解决人脸识别系统中的后门攻击问题提供了创新性的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

Method: 提出基于梯度优化的对抗伪装框架，包括梯度校准策略（改进跨距离的梯度一致性）和梯度去相关方法（消除冲突更新，提高稳定性与多角度优化效果）。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多种检测模型、角度和距离下优于现有技术，攻击成功率（ASR）在距离上平均提升13.46%，在角度上提升11.03%。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，提高系统设计的鲁棒性至关重要，同时提出的方法显著提升了对抗伪装的效果，可对安全关键领域产生重要影响。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

TL;DR: 提出SmoothSA方法，通过预热冷启动查询和区分转化方式，优化图像/视频的Slot Attention过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动查询缺少样本特定信息，影响首帧聚合精准性，以及非首帧查询需求与首帧的不同无法满足的问题。

Method: 1. 预热首帧的冷启动查询，引入融合输入特征信息的模块；2. 区分首帧和非首帧的转换方式，分别采用完全迭代和单次迭代。

Result: 在对象发现、识别和下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，并提供了相关分析与解释。

Conclusion: SmoothSA改进了Slot Attention的迭代与递归操作，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的显著性图方法仅限于捕获一阶属性，忽略了视觉-语言编码器中复杂的跨模态交互。需要一种更强大的工具来解释这种复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种基于博弈论的解释框架——FIxLIP，利用加权Banzhaf交互指数，提供更高效灵活的相似性分解方案，并扩展了现有的解释评估方法以支持高阶交互。

Result: 通过MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试验证，FIxLIP在质量上优于传统的一阶归因方法。此外还演示了其在模型比较中的实用性。

Conclusion: FIxLIP能够提供高质量解释，并在多个模型比较和基准测试中表现出色，展示了跨模态交互分析的重要性。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Motivation: 作者希望解决传统流方法在异常检测任务中的模型表达能力不足问题，并为高效异常检测和定位提供一种新的理论基础。

Method: 通过定义时间反向流匹配（rFM）作为沿预定义概率路径的向量场回归，结合提出的最差传输（WT）位移插值，构建对正常样本形成“退化势阱”，对异常样本提供分离机制的框架。

Conclusion: FM提供了一种理论深度的、新颖的无监督异常检测范式，尤其能够高效扩展至复杂数据，展示了其潜在的应用价值和可靠性。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Conclusion: F2PASeg和PAS数据集为垂体手术规划提供了可靠工具，有助于提升术中安全性和分割准确性。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Method: 构造强白盒和自适应攻击，评估多种压缩模型在高拟真和低拟真图像生成下的对抗攻击表现，并分析其背后的机制。

Result: 高拟真图像压缩模型在对抗攻击下表现出更强的抗性，而低拟真模型易受攻击。此抗性并非梯度屏蔽导致，而是因高拟真图像与自然图像的分布对齐。

Conclusion: 高拟真图像压缩技术在对抗攻击防御中展现了潜力，未来需研发更有效的攻击技术以评估其全面的安全性。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

*Yunshuang Yuan,Frank Thiemann,Thorsten Dahms,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种针对历史地图的分割模型SMOL-MapSeg，其基于深度学习和OND提示机制可有效改进对历史地图的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来深度学习领域取得了显著进展，预训练基础模型在多个领域表现优异。然而，这些模型在历史地图数据的分割任务中表现不佳，原因在于历史地图的图案样式多样且缺乏一致性。

Method: 通过引入按需声明式（OND）知识提示机制，该机制允许用户在推理时明确指定目标概念和模式对应关系，并将其集成到基础模型SAM中。同时对模型进行针对历史地图的微调，最终得到SMOL-MapSeg模型。

Result: 实验表明，SMOL-MapSeg模型能够准确分割利用OND知识定义的类别，并且通过少样本微调适配未见过的类别，其性能超越了基于UNet的基线方法。

Conclusion: SMOL-MapSeg模型通过引入OND提示机制解决了历史地图分割中的一致性不足问题，表现出优越的适应能力和分割效果。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了AutoIAD，一个多代理协作框架用于自动化工业视觉异常检测开发，并显著提升了任务完成率及模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业异常检测需要大量人工干预的问题，提升自动化程度以减少人力成本。

Method: 引入一个以Manager为中心代理管理的多代理协作框架，并结合领域知识库来完成从原始图像到训练模型的端到端自动化流程。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集的测试中，AutoIAD在任务完成率（AUROC）及模型性能上优于现有的通用协作框架及传统AutoML框架，同时有效缓解了逻辑跳跃等问题。

Conclusion: Manager中心代理和领域知识库模块对AutoIAD的成功至关重要，其框架在工业异常检测方面展现出高效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨在形状分析中的手性信息提取，提出一种基于 Diff3F 的无监督手性特征提取方法，从 2D 模型中获取手性信息。实验验证了其在不同任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管手性信息在电脑视觉领域（如图像、视频、点云、网格）中广泛存在，但其在形状分析中的研究较少开展。现有的形状顶点描述符存在难以区分左右对称部分的局限性，因此开发手性特征提取器变得必要。

Method: 基于 Diff3F 框架，本文提出了一种无监督手性特征提取流程，从二维基础模型中提取具备手性信息的形状特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的手性特征在左右区分、形状匹配以及部分分割等下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 所构建的手性特征提取器能够有效地为形状顶点提供手性信息，并展现其实用性。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

TL;DR: MagicHOI利用单目视频和新视角合成模型，改善了手-物三维重建的效果，尤其是在不可见物体区域的推测上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手-物重建方法依赖模板或假设物体完全可见，但这些假设在真实场景中经常不成立，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出了一种结合新视角合成扩散模型和可见接触约束的方法，通过提供丰富的物体监督信息，改善不可见区域的重建质量。

Result: 实验表明，MagicHOI在三维手-物体重建的准确性上显著超越现有方法，同时新视角扩散模型有效优化了不可见的物体区域。

Conclusion: MagicHOI通过创新方法解决了手-物体重建中的关键问题，在难解的真实场景中表现尤为出色，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种自监督预训练框架，用于在事件数据中提取边缘信息和纹理线索，从而实现更准确的视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件数据稀疏且噪声较大，主要反映亮度变化，这使得有效的特征提取变得复杂，因此需要一种新方法更好地利用事件数据。

Method: 提出了一个自监督预训练框架，包括三个阶段：1. 基于差异引导的掩码建模，重建时间强度差值图以增强事件数据中的信息；2. 固定主干网络的特征转换，通过对比学习事件与图像特征，同时保持掩码建模的表示效果；3. 聚焦对比学习，关注高价值区域以改进语义区分能力。

Conclusion: 文章证明了通过所提出的框架可以充分挖掘事件数据的潜在信息，从而在多种任务中实现更优表现。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人在密集遮挡环境下的追踪问题，传统依赖Re-ID模型和线性运动假设的方法在严重遮挡情况下表现不佳。

Method: 通过引入检测器回归和分类分支的特征表示、头部关键点检测模型，以及迭代的优化卡尔曼滤波（整合了3D先验）进行改善追踪模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在遮挡显著的复杂场景中实现了更稳定、更准确的行人追踪，为多目标追踪提供了更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过输入空间添加高斯噪声提升鲁棒性，但会牺牲图像质量，需要一种不影响视觉效果的鲁棒性认证方法。

Method: 通过分析网络Jacobian的最大奇异值，将特征空间噪声与输入空间扰动形式关联，实现无架构修改的高效认证防御方法。

Result: 减少推理时间99.5%（无认证情况下）和20.6%（认证情况下），在基准数据集上的实验中，主观质量得分相关性提升高达30.9%。

Conclusion: 提出的特征空间随机平滑方法相较于现有方法更高效、更准确，为广泛的IQA场景提供了更优解。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Motivation: 现有的结构化剪枝方法忽视了参数之间的相互联系，为了改进剪枝效果并减少性能损失，有必要提出新的评估标准和剪枝机制。

Method: 提出了Jacobian Criterion作为第一梯度指标来衡量参数的重要性，同时设计了Equivalent Pruning机制，通过使用自编码器保留原始和被修剪连接的贡献。

Result: 实验表明Jacobian Criterion在保存模型性能方面优于现有指标，Equivalent Pruning机制有效减轻了剪枝后微调导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: Optimal Brain Connection框架提高了结构化剪枝的有效性，其创新的标准与机制为神经网络压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Motivation: 部分标注数据集存在未定义和未标注的模糊动作，在神经科学及部分应用场景中尤为关键。

Method: 提出两步法：1. Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) 模拟已标注动作粒度，识别已知及未知动作的时间片段；2. Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) 基于嵌入相似性分配未知动作的语义类别。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads、Desktop Assembly三大数据集上进行了系统测试，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 新方法为部分标注场景中的动作识别提供了更优解决方案，有效捕捉时间和语义层面的细节。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章介绍了视觉生成领域中的WeTok视觉分词器，其在压缩比和重建保真度之间实现了显著的进步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器面临压缩比和重建保真度之间的不理想权衡，作者旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两项关键创新：(1) 分组查表无关量化(GQ): 将潜在特征分组并进行查表无关量化，以实现更大规模码书下的重建突破。(2) 生成解码(GD): 在解码时引入噪声变量的先验，以条件化离散标记重建视觉细节。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok在零样本rFID指标中创造了新的最低记录（0.12），并且在高压缩比下的性能超越了Cosmos等方法。

Conclusion: WeTok实现了目前最高的性能，在视觉压缩与生成领域的应用潜力巨大。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

*Tao Sun,Oliver Liu,JinJin Li,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LLaVA-RE，一个用于二元图文相关性评估的多模态大语言模型，实验验证其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态生成AI评估中，图文相关性评估是一项基础性但具有挑战的问题，尤其是在文本形式多样且相关性定义因场景而异的情况下。

Method: 提出使用多模态大语言模型MLLMs，依据LLaVA架构，通过详细的任务指令和多模态上下文样本，再结合一个覆盖多任务的全新二元相关性数据集开展研究。

Result: 实验结果验证了提出框架的有效性。

Conclusion: MLLMs能有效处理复杂任务用于二元图文相关性评估，并具有灵活性和准确性，在构建评估工具时具备潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

### [98] [Hi3DEval: Advancing 3D Generation Evaluation with Hierarchical Validity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05609)
*Yuhan Zhang,Long Zhuo,Ziyang Chu,Tong Wu,Zhibing Li,Liang Pan,Dahua Lin,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Hi3DEval的分层评估框架，用于生成3D内容的质量评估，并引入Hi3DBench数据集和自动评分系统，与现有方法相比提供了更精确和符合人类偏好的评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前3D内容生成质量评估方法主要依赖于基于图像的指标，局限于物体级别，难以捕捉空间一致性、材质真实性以及高保真局部细节。该研究旨在克服这些局限性。

Method: 该研究提出Hi3DEval框架，结合物体级和部件级评估，实现多维度和细粒度的质量分析；同时，提供Hi3DBench数据集以支持框架，用多代理注释流程生成高质量标注数据；采用基于混合3D表示的自动评分系统，结合视频表示和预训练3D特征增强模型能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在3D特性建模中优于现有基于图像的指标，并且在人类偏好对齐方面表现更佳，提供了一种可扩展的替代手工评估方法。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval框架通过分层评估和多维分析显著提升了生成3D内容质量评估的精度和效率，并证明了其在真实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2 是一个用于视频目标分割（VOS）的新数据集，包含复杂场景下更多挑战，揭示现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注显著、孤立的目标对象，未能覆盖现实世界中复杂场景的多样性和挑战性。

Method: 提出 MOSEv2 数据集，包括 5024 个视频和超过 701,976 个高质量遮罩，涵盖 200 类共 10,074 个目标对象，同时引入场景复杂性和多种新挑战，同时对 20 个 VOS 方法和 9 个视频目标跟踪方法进行基准测试。

Result: MOSEv2 显著增加了现有方法的难度（e.g., SAM2 的性能从76.4%下降至50.9%），并在多任务下显著观察到性能滑坡。

Conclusion: 现有方法在现实世界复杂场景面前表现不佳，MOSEv2 为推动复杂场景下的 VOS 研究提供了新挑战和机会。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GAP的方法，通过多视角优化和文本引导，将无色点云转换为高保真3D高斯分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法只能从有颜色点云生成高斯分布，而无法从无色点云直接生成3D高斯分布的问题。

Method: 设计了多视角优化框架，利用深度感知图像扩散模型生成一致的外观，同时加入表面锚定机制以确保几何精确性，并引入基于扩散的修补策略优化难以观察的区域。

Result: GAP方法在从合成点云到复杂真实扫描的多种任务中实现了高水平的表现，并成功扩展到大规模场景。

Conclusion: GAP通过创新性的多视角和表面锚定方法，为无色3D点云直接生成高斯分布提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FaceAnonyMixer的新方法，用于生成隐私保护的人脸图像，同时保持与现有FR系统的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人脸识别技术的进步，隐私保护成为主要问题，需要一种可以保护身份又不影响识别效果的方案。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实脸部图像的潜在编码和基于可撤销密钥的合成编码，并运用多目标损失函数进行优化。

Result: FaceAnonyMixer在基准数据集上的实验表明，其在提供更强隐私保护的同时，还提升了识别精度，与最新方法相比在商业API上提高了11%以上。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer是一种可撤销的生成框架，能够在现有FR系统配置不变的情况下生成高质量的隐私保护人脸图像，平衡了隐私保护和识别性能。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过在转录对话中添加元数据标签（如讲话人的年龄、性别、情感等），丰富转录对话内容的方法。利用冻结的音频基础模型与语言模型，无需特定任务微调即可完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话转录流程往往局限于改善语法、标点和可读性，而缺乏对讲话人特征的标注。本文提出了一种方法为转录对话添加元数据标签以丰富文本表现能力。

Method: 使用冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量有效的连接器将音频与语言表示连接起来，无需微调模型即可推断讲话人属性。

Result: 在讲话人特征分析任务中，本方法表现出具有竞争力的性能，并保持了模块化和高效性。同时，使用冻结的LLAMA模型比较x矢量，在部分场景中实现了8.8%的Equal Error Rate。

Conclusion: 通过结合预训练模型和轻量化设计，提出了一种高效、灵活且无需微调的新方法，可增强对话文本的表达力并取得优异的分析性能。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种改进的BPE算法，旨在为低资源语言提供更公平的分词结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的分词算法倾向于高频语言，这对低资源语言用户造成不公平的计算和财务负担。

Method: 引入Parity-aware BPE算法，通过在每步合并时最大化当前压缩效果最差语言的压缩增益，使低资源语言的分词效果更公平。

Result: Parity-aware BPE在不同语言中实现了更均衡的分词数量，对整体压缩率的影响可以忽略，对下游任务的语言模型性能没有实质性影响。

Conclusion: 改进的算法可以在保持全局性能的前提下，提升跨语言公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 探索利用音高重音检测模块增强半监督语音表示的语音识别性能。

Method: 通过联合训练ASR和音高重音检测组件的模型，实现同时进行语音识别和音高重音检测的任务。

Result: 音高重音检测在F1得分上提高了41%，同时在资源有限的条件下，ASR模型的WER降低了28.3%。

Conclusion: 扩展预训练语音模型以保留或重新学习包括音高重音在内的韵律特征的重要性得以证明。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

TL;DR: 该论文提出PERSIST框架，对25+开源大模型进行系统性性格稳定性测试，结果表明即使是大规模模型也存在显著的行为变异性，挑战了当前模型一致性部署的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型的行为一致性及其性格特性，以评估其在安全部署中的可靠性。

Method: 引入PERSIST框架，利用传统和适配LLM的性格测量工具，系统测试25+模型（1B-671B参数），分析问题顺序、措辞变化、人格设定和推理模式对行为一致性的影响。

Result: 发现即使是400B+模型，其行为仍存在显著变异性（SD > 0.4）；简单的提示顺序变化即可导致性格测量变化达20%；一些旨在稳定行为的干预措施反而增加了变异性；性格测量工具的稳定性问题与模型架构有关。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型缺乏真正的行为一致性，依赖人格属性对齐的方法可能在安全关键场景中不适用。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体LLM系统在复杂推理与决策任务中的表现依赖全上下文路由，这导致了高令牌消耗、冗余内存曝光及交互适应性差的问题。

Method: 提出了RCR-Router，该框架通过轻量评分策略动态选择与角色和任务阶段相关的语义内存子集，同时严格控制令牌预算，并通过共享内存进行逐步上下文优化。

Result: 在HotPotQA、MuSiQue和2WikiMultihop等任务中，RCR-Router减少令牌使用高达30%，且提高或保持答案质量。

Conclusion: 研究显示，有结构的内存路由与结果导向的评估对实现可扩展的多智能体LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的语言偏见问题，并提出相应测试框架以检测和测量。

Method: 通过设计100个验证的问答对，模拟访谈场景，生成受控语言变体以隔离特定现象，同时保持语义等效性，测量模型偏见。

Result: 发现模型在面对模糊语句时评分平均降低25.6%，并成功定位模型特定偏见。

Conclusion: 建立了检测和测量AI系统中语言歧视的基础框架，可广泛应用于确保自动化决策的公平性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [108] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言聚类的框架以改进对视觉活动识别系统的评估方法，更好地应对动词语义模糊性和图像解释多义性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的精确匹配评估无法充分捕捉图像动作中动词语义的模糊性和视角差异，导致对模型性能评估的不足。

Method: 提出了一个基于视觉-语言聚类的评估框架，该框架通过动词意义聚类来捕捉每个图像中多个不同的视角和语义层次，从而更全面地评估活动识别模型。

Result: 分析表明，每幅图像平均映射到2.8个意义聚类，并对多个活动识别模型进行了基于聚类的评估，与人类判断的对齐分析显示，这种方法更能反映人类的判断。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的评估方法比标准评估方法更能捕捉模型性能的细微差异，并更符合人类的评判标准，为未来视觉活动识别系统的评估提供了更加全面的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

Result: 框架在提取SDoH因子和上下文相关性方面表现更优，同时通过微调小型任务模型，以更低成本实现了类似或更佳性能。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了从非结构化文本中提取与自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明性，可用于早期风险识别和更有效的预防策略开发。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新方法，改进对话中的目标、方面、观点和情感四元组提取，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设对话中的情感元素均匀分布，但实际上对话往往包含多个独立的语义子对话，这为关系学习引入了噪声。本文旨在改进这一问题。

Method: 提出使用结构熵最小化算法划分对话，保留相关语句并尽量区分无关部分；同时设计出两步框架，首先提取情感元素，然后在子对话层级匹配四元组。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法对对话中的语义子结构进行了有效的捕捉和抽取，改进了现有方法的表现与效率，适用于多轮多参与者对话的情感分析。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM

Conclusion: 简化的架构（即单适配器+对齐损失）比复杂多适配器架构更有效，强调学习任务间的共享表示是多任务学习泛化的关键。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

Result: 在Factify2数据集上，多模态事实验证框架"MultiCheck"取得了0.84的加权F1分数，显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式的多模态推理方法对于处理复杂的现实场景具有良好的可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG技术存在由于检索信息量大而导致的注意力稀释及熵增长问题，需要一种方法来提高其适应不同上下文长度的能力。

Method: 提出了一个以熵不变性为核心的框架BEE-RAG，通过平衡上下文的信息熵，重新设计注意力机制，并结合零样本推理策略及高效参数微调以获得不同场景下的优化平衡因子。

Result: 大量实验表明，BEE-RAG在多种RAG任务中的表现优异。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG有效解决了上下文长度变化对于RAG性能的影响，实现了更稳定的系统效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了大的语言模型对输入信息位置的敏感性，并提出一种名为Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank)的方法，通过调整关键信息的位置来显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型对输入信息位置的敏感性及其对性能的影响。

Method: 提出一种Attention-Driven Reranking（AttnRank）框架，通过小型校准数据集估算模型位置注意偏好，并重新排序输入内容，使关键信息对齐到高注意区域。

Result: 实验表明，在多跳问答和少样本上下文学习任务中，AttnRank在10种不同的语言模型上都显著提升了性能，无需修改模型参数或训练过程。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用模型的注意力偏好，可以优化输入内容的位置分布，从而提高大语言模型的性能。AttnRank方法是高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Motivation: 在医疗领域整合大语言模型必须关注其伦理推理能力，而现有基准未充分覆盖这一点。

Method: 创建了一个名为PrinciplismQA的基准，包含从权威教材和伦理案例文献中选取并由医学专家验证的问题，包括选择题和开放式问题，用于系统地评估模型的伦理能力。

Result: 实验发现大语言模型在医疗场景中难以动态应用伦理知识，特别是行善原则上表现不佳。同时，前沿的封闭源模型表现更优，且医学领域微调可提升模型的伦理能力。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA能刻画大语言模型在医疗伦理推理方面的特定缺陷，为开发更平衡、负责任的医疗AI提供了基础。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种有效且可扩展的代码后训练框架，可无需人工指令而增强代码大模型的效能。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Conclusion: 通过颠覆传统假设并提出适应性校正机制，该研究凸显了在大语言模型推理中，诊断特定失败模式和采用自适应校正策略的重要性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Method: 使用解码器式的转换器，通过冻结的SONAR解码器传播目标，同时结合交叉熵和抽象空间的嵌入方法进行训练。

Result: 在39M到1.3B参数范围内实现了有竞争力的生成质量，并公开了训练代码和所有预训练检查点。

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM通过一种混合目标保持LCM优点的同时简化生成过程，显现出良好的扩展性和实际研究价值。

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

*Jiameng Huang,Baijiong Lin,Guhao Feng,Jierun Chen,Di He,Lu Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法CGRS，旨在减少LRLMs中过度推理问题，同时保持推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理语言模型在长链式推理中存在反思行为，这些行为虽增强性能却带来冗余推理问题。研究的目的是减少这种过度推理带来的影响，提升推理效率。

Method: 作者提出了一种名为Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS)的方法，通过在模型对其当前响应具有较高信心时动态抑制生成反思触发，从而避免冗余的反思循环。该方法对模型无依赖性，不需要模型重新训练或架构修改，并可与现有自回归生成流程无缝集成。

Result: CGRS方法在四个推理基准测试中减少了18.5%-41.9%的token使用量，同时保持了推理准确性。该方法验证了其在不同规模和架构的模型上的一致表现，并与最新基准相比表现出最佳的推理效率平衡。

Conclusion: CGRS展示了其在提升LRLM推理效率方面的实用价值，能够在减少冗余推理步骤的同时维持较高的推理准确性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了在Microsoft Hololens 2上添加可调节设置的手语虚拟化身效果。虽然用户更偏好可调节版本，但在用户体验和理解度上没有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过添加可调整功能来提高手语虚拟化身在实际应用中的可理解性、用户体验和接受度。

Method: 让德国手语(DGS)专家与可调节和不可调节的虚拟化身互动，并分析影响用户体验的关键因素。

Result: 尽管用户偏好调整功能，但UX和可理解性未显著改善。而SL元素缺失和技术问题（如不清晰的手形及菜单位置）是主要障碍。

Conclusion: 提出仅靠个性化是不够的，需提升默认的手语可理解性，并建议改进面部动画、改良交互界面以及引入参与式设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Motivation: 研究在特定专业领域搜索中引入自我反馈机制的潜力，以增强LLM的输出质量和透明性，特别是面向生物医学研究等专业需求较高的领域。

Method: 通过BioASQ CLEF 2025挑战，测试Gemini-Flash 2.0、o3-mini、o4-mini和DeepSeek-R1等多种LLM的性能，引入自我反馈机制让模型生成、评价并改进自己的输出，涵盖多种问题类型（是/否、事实、列表、理想解）。

Result: 初步结果显示，自我反馈策略在不同模型和任务之间的性能表现不一致。

Conclusion: 本文为研究LLM自我纠正机制的有效性提供了初步见解，并建议未来进一步研究LLM生成反馈与人工专家输入的对比。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型因高资源语言数据训练而导致的文化偏见，并更准确地评估多元文化背景的表现。

Method: 设计了MyCulture基准，在马来语中通过开放式多选题格式而非传统的固定选项进行评估，同时研究结构化与自由形式输出的表现差异。

Result: 通过对区域和国际模型的测试，发现了文化理解能力上的显著差异，表明现有评估方法不足。

Conclusion: 需要更加注重文化基础和语言包容性的基准来开发和评估大语言模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Motivation: 当前LLMs的评估方法依赖静态基准测试，但容易受到数据污染和排行榜过拟合的影响，难以真实反映模型的能力。为此，研究人员希望通过动态评估方式确保评估的公平性与可信度。

Method: 提出了LLMEval-3框架，其基于22万道研究生级别的问题库，动态抽取未见过的测试集。其自动化管道通过抗污染数据处理、反作弊架构及基于LLM的评估（与人类专家有90%一致性）实现评价。同时，采用相对排名系统确保比较的公平性。

Result: 通过长达20个月的实验，评估了近50种主流模型，发现了知识记忆的性能上限及静态基准检测不到的数据污染问题。该框架在排名稳定性和一致性方面表现出极高的稳健性。

Conclusion: LLMEval-3框架验证了动态评估范式的有效性，为超越传统排行榜分数的LLM能力评估提供了可靠的方法学，促进了可信评估标准的发展。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型尽管在语义任务上表现出色，但在精细化的token级别理解和结构化推理上存在困难，需要基准来诊断其弱点并推动改进。

Method: 开发了TASE基准，包括10项任务（如字符计数、token对齐等），覆盖三种语言（中文、英语、韩语），并构建了35,927个实例评估集，同时提出了可扩展的合成数据生成管道。评估了30多个主流LLMs，并训练了一种新的定制模型。

Result: 人类性能显著优于现有的LLMs，揭示了它们在token级别任务中的持续性弱点。

Conclusion: TASE对LLMs在低级语言理解与跨语言泛化能力的局限性提供了洞察，同时为未来改进提出了诊断工具，数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: 在不同的创造性领域，衡量创造力的指标各异，但这些指标与实际的人类创造力评价并不完全吻合，因此需要深入探讨其有效性及改进方向。

Method: 对包括创意写作、非传统问题解决和研究构想在内的多个创造性领域中，比较和分析了多种创造力测量方法，如创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM作为评审标准的表现。

Result: 发现现有方法捕捉了创造力的不同维度，但它们在一致性和稳定性方面较差，同时存在偏差和局限性，例如创造力指数过于关注词汇多样性，句法模板无法捕捉概念创造力等。

Conclusion: 需要发展更具鲁棒性和普适性的评估框架，与人类对创造力的判断更为一致。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中因缺乏复杂推理能力而导致的错误生成问题，并改进现有RAG框架在语义检索和逻辑组织上的不足。

Method: 采用问题分解的方式，将复杂问题分解为有逻辑依赖顺序的原子子问题，并逐步解决，结合逻辑终止机制避免错误传播，最终综合子问题答案生成验证结果。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实验表明，LAG显著提高了推理鲁棒性，减少了幻觉现象，并使LLM解决问题的过程与人类认知更加一致。

Conclusion: LAG框架为现有的RAG系统提供了一种更加系统化和稳健的替代方法，有助于提升模型在知识密集型任务下的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型已被调试以减轻显性偏见，但其训练数据中的隐性偏见仍然存在，作者希望通过新颖的评估框架揭示这些隐性偏见。

Method: 采用20问游戏这一多轮推理任务，开发了一个新数据集Geo20Q+，并在多个语言与配置中测试模型的表现，以评估地理表现差异。

Result: 发现模型在推断来自全球北方和西方的实体时表现更优于来自全球南方和东方的实体，同时测试语言对表现差异影响较小。

Conclusion: 通过创造性评估框架，作者揭示了大语言模型推理中的地理和文化隐性偏见，同时发布了相关数据集和代码以推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在处理长文本和复杂背景时表现出色，但它们容易生成不准确或幻觉性的内容，其在法律领域的应用受到了阻碍，需要一种新的方法来保证生成内容的忠实性。

Method: 提出了一种名为CoCoLex的解码策略，通过动态插值模型的词汇分布与基于上下文复制生成的分布，利用模型信心指导以确保对来源的内容的忠实性。

Result: 实验结果表明，在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有的上下文感知解码方法，特别是在长文生成任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: CoCoLex作为一种创新解码策略，有效提升了法律文本生成的上下文忠实度，为法律领域应用大语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

Motivation: 传统大语言模型在高风险领域的问答中表现不稳定，存在幻觉和过度自信等问题，亟需提升其可靠性。

Method: 利用一致性预测和频率采样方法，通过多次采样模型输出分布并计算预测熵（PE），用以区分正确与错误预测，并控制实证误覆盖率。

Result: 在六个大语言模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法的预测熵在区分正确与错误预测方面优于基于logit的预测熵（AUROC评价），并有效控制风险水平下的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需依赖分布、与模型无关的框架，改善了多项选择题问答任务中大语言模型的不确定性量化，提高其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨文化背景中的政治观点差异是否能在多语言大模型中跨语言转移，从而了解这些模型中的语言-文化交互机制。

Method: 使用投票建议应用中的政治声明，通过对模型不同语言间的政治观点评价，及使用直接偏好优化进行左/右观点对齐后再分析。

Result: 研究显示未对齐模型在跨语言政治观点上差异极少，而左/右观点对齐后，所有五种语言的观点几乎同步变化。

Conclusion: 在西方语言环境中，政治观点能在语言间转移。这表明多语言大模型在实现显式的社会语言、文化和政治对齐方面存在困难。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith提出一种新方法，通过从零开始合成具有挑战性的数学问题，旨在提高LLM的数学推理能力。在多个基准测试中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学推理领域的进步受限于高质量、高难度训练数据的匮乏。目前方法多基于模板，限制了问题的多样性和扩展性。

Method: 提出了MathSmith框架，通过从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成新问题，避免数据污染；设计九种软约束策略提高问题难度；使用强化学习优化结构有效性、推理复杂度和答案一致性。还通过自回归生成的推理轨迹长度反映认知难度，鼓励长链式推理。

Result: 在多个基准（GSM8K、MATH-500、AIME2024、AIME2025、OlympiadBench）中，MathSmith在短链和长链推理设置下均优于现有基线，具备强扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 验证了高难度合成数据对增强大语言模型推理能力的潜力，MathSmith能够有效生成多样且具有挑战性的数学问题。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的RL框架Cooper，通过联合优化策略模型和奖励模型解决了现有奖励范式的鲁棒性和奖励欺骗问题，并通过实验展示了其在改进RL表现上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则和模型的奖励体系存在鲁棒性差及易受奖励欺骗影响的问题，亟需一种方法来解决这些挑战以提升大型语言模型的推理性能。

Method: 提出了Cooper框架，通过动态构建正负样本对优化奖励模型，并结合混合标注策略提高数据生成效率，同时引入基于参考的奖励建模方式以提升准确性。

Result: 开发奖励模型VerifyRM，在测试基准VerifyBench上表现优于同类模型，使用Cooper进行强化学习实验，获得了0.54%的平均准确性提升，验证了其在抗奖励欺骗和提升RL性能方面的效果。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型可以有效对抗奖励欺骗，并为强化学习中更好地整合奖励模型提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了OmniEAR，一个用于评估语言模型在具身任务中推理能力的框架，通过文本环境建模考察物理交互、工具使用和多代理协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在抽象推理方面表现优异，但其处理具身代理任务的推理能力尚未深入探索。

Method: OmniEAR 包括动态能力获取及依赖任务需求自主确定协调策略。通过文本环境表征观察持续物理属性与复杂空间关系，覆盖1,500个场景。

Result: 模型在显式指令条件下表现最好（85-96%成功率），但在工具推理和隐式协作分别降至56-85%及63-85%，复合任务失败率超50%。细调对单代理任务提升明显，但对多代理进展有限。

Conclusion: 具身推理相比抽象推理提出了全新挑战，现有模型架构存在能力瓶颈，OmniEAR成为一项严谨评估与推进具身AI系统的重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的奖励函数，同时考虑事实精确性、回答细节和答案相关性，并通过在线强化学习显著减少大型语言模型的幻觉生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理大型语言模型在处理复杂推理任务时表现出色，但在长篇事实性任务中经常生成幻觉，缺乏可靠的验证方法。

Method: 通过提出结合事实精确性、回答细节和答案相关性的奖励函数，并在在线强化学习中应用，解决现有方法在长篇事实性任务中存在的奖励机制漏洞。

Result: 在六个长篇事实性基准上进行评估，新模型幻觉率平均降低了23.1个百分点，回答细节提升23％，整体响应的有用性没有下降。

Conclusion: 通过新奖励函数和在线强化学习的结合，可实现高质量的事实推理，显著改善推理型语言模型在长篇事实性任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用简单的线性探针分析方法来研究LLMs在多轮对话中说服人类的能力及其动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明，LLMs具有理解用户情感和政治视角的能力，但对其如何在多轮对话中实现说服的动态依然了解有限。

Method: 采用线性探针，结合认知科学理论，训练探针分析说服成功、被说服者性格及说服策略等多个方面。

Result: 探针能有效捕捉说服动态，包括对话中被说服的具体时间点以及全数据集中说服成功的趋势。此外，探针的效率超过基于提示的方法，并在特定情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 线性探针为研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操控）提供了高效且有潜力的方法，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据集分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决字节级语言模型在多形态语言中因单词周期长度过长而导致的计算挑战，建立高效的无标记化语言模型。

Method: 提出了H-NET++模型，包含轻量级Transformer语境混合器、两级潜在超先验、特殊的正字法处理和基于课程的分阶段训练。

Result: 在1.4B-token的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++在压缩率、模型鲁棒性和形态边界识别方面优于现有方法，实现了12%的压缩提升和对波斯语传播的高度一致性。

Conclusion: H-NET++的层级动态分块方法为多形态语言提供了一种有效的免标记化解决方案，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能系统，用于工业机械的规范性维修，超越传统异常检测，提供可执行的维护建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以防止灾难性故障并优化运营效率，因此需要一个智能系统进行规范性维护。

Method: 通过将轴承振动数据序列化为自然语言，结合LLM进行少样本异常检测，并使用多代理组件处理维修手册和网络搜索以提供全面的维护建议方案。

Conclusion: 该系统在状态监测与可执行维护规划之间架起了桥梁，为工业实践者提供了智能的决策支持，并为跨行业的机械部件规范性维修提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Motivation: 本文旨在弥补主流基于Q&A基准方法的局限性，探讨通过棋盘游戏评估LLMs的能力，以全面分析其技术表现和心理适应性。

Method: 提出Qi Town评估平台，支持5种常见棋盘游戏和20个LLM玩家，采用Elo评级系统和性能循环图表（PLG）量化能力，结合积极情绪评分（PSS）评估心理适应力，通过循环赛结构进行系统比较。

Result: 实验发现，大多数LLMs在输赢上都表现出乐观心态，在高压对抗环境中比人类适应性更强。然而，PLG揭示了LLMs技能表现的不稳定性。

Conclusion: LLMs在对抗性环境中具有适应力，但其技能不稳定性需要进一步研究以改进性能。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Motivation: 解决传统基于云的大型语言模型(LLMs)存在的隐私和可扩展性问题，开发脱离服务器的自主AWebGIS。

Method: 比较以下三种方法：基于云端LLM的全自动在线方法、基于传统机器学习分类器的半自动离线方法和基于微小语言模型SLM（T5-small）的离线客户端方法。

Result: 第三种方法表现最佳，精确匹配准确率达0.93，Levenshtein相似度为0.99，ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L得分为0.98，且减轻了后端服务器负载。

Conclusion: 客户端计算策略可以有效支持自主AWebGIS解决方案，为实现浏览器可执行模型提供了可能性。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了强化学习（RL）和策略梯度算法在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的推理能力提升，尤其是在不理想场景下的表现，在八个公共数据集测试中发现RL微调在理想环境下有效，但在非理想场景下表现显著下滑。


<details>

Motivation: 目前大型语言模型的推理能力评估大多在理想化环境中，忽视了实际应用中的非理想场景。研究基于脑科学发现，尝试对人类在不完美输入下的可靠推理能力进行模拟与研究。

Method: 定义三类具有实际意义的非理想场景，包括摘要推理、细粒度噪声抑制和上下文过滤；使用策略梯度算法对三种LLMs和一种先进的视觉语言模型（LVLM）进行RL微调，并在八个公开数据集上测试其性能。

Result: 实验结果表明RL微调虽然提高了模型在理想情况的推理能力，但在非理想场景下的性能显著下降，揭示了当前方法的重大推理能力不足。

Conclusion: 尽管提出了针对场景的补救方法，但现有策略仍难以解决模型推理缺陷，需更重视非理想场景下的评估，此举凸显了对模型真实能力再评价的急切性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Motivation: 目前AI代理无法在复杂领域（如医疗）中有效进行策略规划，依赖静态预定义策略是一个关键限制。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，一种自我进化的AI代理，通过元层级进化机制，自主改进问题解决策略，并提取成功与失败经验构建战略知识库。同时引入评价基准EHRFlowBench。

Conclusion: 这项研究实现了从构建更强工具用户到设计更智能、自我进化任务管理者的必要转变，为更自主有效的科学发现AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有的多任务学习模型在配体对接中的性能比蛋白质口袋对接弱，主要因为配体和蛋白质结构的复杂度不同。

Method: 提出了Docking Game框架，将蛋白-配体交互建模为两玩家游戏，并开发了Loop Self-Play算法，通过两层循环机制训练配体和蛋白质模块。

Result: 实验表明，所提算法在预测准确结合方式上比现有最优方法提升了约10%。

Conclusion: 新方法有望显著提升药物发现中的分子对接精确性。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了CogniWeb，一个具有双重处理能力的网络导航智能代理，通过结合快速反应和深思熟虑的规划，在WebArena测试中取得43.96%的成功率，同时大幅减少75%的计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络导航中的决策复杂性和动态环境要求研究更加高效且智能的读取及推理方法，现有方法未能有效结合离线模仿学习与在线探索。

Method: 研究通过借鉴人类认知的双重处理理论，提出将快速反应（System 1）和深思熟虑（System 2）相结合的模块化智能代理框架CogniWeb。

Result: 实验结果表明，CogniWeb在WebArena测试中表现优异，实现了43.96%的成功率，同时在效率方面提升显著，减少了75%的令牌使用量。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过结合两种学习方式及认知理论，实现了效率与性能的平衡，为复杂环境下的AI导航代理开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

TL;DR: 研究提出了用于评价医学多模态大语言模型知识编辑性能的首个综合基准MedMKEB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医学知识的快速演变，现有的多模态大语言模型需要能够高效地更新过时或错误的信息，而无需从头训练。

Method: 研究构建了MedMKEB基准，基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集，设计了包括反事实修正、语义泛化、知识迁移和对抗鲁棒性等多种编辑任务，结合专家验证以确保基准可靠性。

Result: 通过对现有通用与医学多模态模型的编辑实验，结果揭示了当前模型在医学知识编辑上的局限性。

Conclusion: MedMKEB为可信且高效的医学知识编辑算法的发展提供了标准基准，有利于推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的门尺寸调整框架EasySize，该框架基于微调的Qwen3-8B模型，能够跨工艺节点和电路拓扑实现通用应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的类比电路尺寸调整方法依赖于大模型且缺乏跨技术节点的可移植性，因此需要开发一种普适且高效的方法。

Method: 提出了基于微调Qwen3-8B模型的EasySize框架，结合了动态任务损失函数及全局差分演化与局部粒子群优化技术。

Result: 在不同技术节点和拓扑上，EasySize无需额外训练表现优异，并在资源利用率上显著优于现有方法（如AutoCkt）。

Conclusion: EasySize能够大幅降低对人类专业知识和计算资源的需求，从而加速和简化模拟电路设计过程。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用异构图神经网络（Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network）模型来解决流程挖掘中事件日志数据缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为现实世界中的事件日志数据存在缺失问题，而传统的方法要么依赖过程模型，要么使用机器学习/深度学习模型，难以充分表达复杂多模态数据。因此，作者希望利用图神经网络的优势解决这些挑战。

Method: 开发了一种异构图神经网络模型，能根据包含缺失事件的轨迹重建这些事件的完整属性，并与基于自编码器的最新方法进行了比较实验。

Result: 在两种合成日志和四种真实日志上，该方法在填补不同类型的缺失值时表现优异，超越了专注于部分事件属性修复的其他模型。

Conclusion: 异构图神经网络在处理和重建多模态复杂序列中的缺失数据方面具有巨大的潜力，可拓展流程挖掘领域的数据修复方法。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有的RAG方法中，单一检索方式（仅基于文本或图像）限制了解决复杂需求的能力，亟需多模态融合及动态检索策略。

Method: 提出了QA-Dragon系统，采用了领域路由器和搜索路由器，分别用于识别问题领域和动态选择检索策略，并结合文本与图像的混合检索形式，支持多模态、多轮次及多跳推理。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM Challenge中，QA-Dragon在单一源、多源和多轮次任务中分别提高了5.06%、6.35%和5.03%的性能，显著优于基线。

Conclusion: 通过动态的混合检索与推理机制，QA-Dragon显著提升了知识密集型VQA任务中的答题正确率与知识覆盖能力，验证了其技术优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

significant challenges -- including information overload and longer response

We propose a novel framework that combines RDF graph databases with LLMs to
process natural language queries for precise audience targeting, while
providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture.
Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决符号模块与神经网络模型欠紧密耦合的问题，结合决策树的可解释性与大语言模型的生成能力。

Method: 设计了一种混合架构，将决策树和随机森林嵌入为统一推理系统内的变量，利用中央协调器维护一致性，并协调代理和外部工具进行推理。

Result: 在推理基准测试中表现优异，在多个任务中获得显著性能提升，例如在ProofWriter上提升逻辑一致性7.2%，在GSM8k数学推理上准确率提高5.3%，以及在ARC抽象推理准确率提升6.0%。

Conclusion: 系统可提供一种强大、可解释且可扩展的通用神经符号推理解决方案，同时展示其在临床和科学发现中的应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Motivation: ‘Agent’一词在不同人工智能领域中的多重解释阻碍了研究交流、系统评价及政策制定，需要重新定义以解决这些问题。

Method: 通过历史分析和当代使用模式，提出了一个框架，以环境交互、学习与适应、自主性、目标复杂性及时间一致性为维度，定义系统何时可被称作“Agent”。

Conclusion: 建议采用术语标准化和框架，以提高研究和政策的有效性，推动学术领域前进。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在涉及法律和伦理难题的开放性、多代理交互中的行为，尤其是其推理与协作能力。

Method: 通过NomicLaw构建模拟环境，在该环境中LLMs需处理法律情景，提出规则、论证其合理性并对提案进行投票，同时测量信任与互惠行为。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs能够自发形成联盟、背叛信任，并通过调整语言策略影响集体决策，展现潜在的社会推理及说服能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调开源LLMs在协商与决策中的潜能，并为未来设计具有自主协商和立法能力的AI系统提供启示。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 描述逻辑中的最小模型推理问题具有重要意义，但目前对其全面理解仍有限，尤其是在“纯”最小模型中的复杂性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 分析描述逻辑中最小模型的复杂性，包括最小化全部谓词的情况。同时，限制TBox的循环性以恢复可判定性，并将其与点状解释联系起来。针对DL-Lite家族还研究复杂性边界问题。

Result: 证明在${EL}$中“纯”最小模型概念满足性问题是不可判定的。提出了通过增加无环限制恢复可判定性并降低复杂性的方案。此外，发现DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$具ExpSpace-hardness。

Conclusion: 在较通用的DL环境中，最小模型推理的完全可判定性仍需进一步限制；所得结果明确了各类逻辑的复杂性边界。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在复杂多问题推理任务中部分正确性评估不足的问题。

Method: 引入StructVRM，使用模型验证器在子问题级别提供语义和数学上的细粒度反馈，避免对严格字符串匹配的依赖。

Result: 提出的Seed-StructVRM在12个公共基准和一个高难度STEM基准中表现卓越，6个基准上达到了当前最优表现。

Conclusion: 通过采用结构化和可验证的奖励，证明此法有效提升了多模态模型在复杂真实推理场景中的能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Motivation: 对铁路系统的预测性维护需求强烈，需要高效准确的方法以提升运营效率，降低成本并提高安全性。

Method: 方法包括样本预处理模块、增量分类机器学习模型以及结果解释模块，并对噪声和类别不平衡数据进行了处理。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了方法的可靠性和实际应用价值，能有效提高决策者的维护效率并减少运营成本。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Motivation: 目前视觉语言模型在复杂动态环境中的精确行动计划等任务表现不佳，而现实任务又通常需要深入理解物理规则，但真实环境中的评估成本高昂。为此，本文构建了一个用于弥合评估需求与现实约束之间差距的模拟基准。

Method: 设计并实现了DeepPHY，一个整合了多种物理推理环境的基准框架。不同的环境具有不同的难度等级，并结合了精细的评估指标，从而全面评估物理推理能力。

Result: 通过DeepPHY的评估，发现尽管当前最先进的视觉语言模型表现卓越，但其在将描述性物理知识转化为精确预测控制方面仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 现有VLMs在物理推理能力上存在局限性，DeepPHY的引入可以为模型评估和改进提供重要参考。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了AI对社会规范和目标的对齐问题，尤其关注地理敏感性对对齐的影响，强调需要根据地区和时间背景调整AI的行为，而非采用一刀切的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同地区文化和政治差异对AI系统实现对齐的挑战，以及如何应对AI自动化和全球化规模带来的知识调控和透明性问题。

Method: 回顾地理相关的关键研究问题，提出未来研究主题，并提出评估对齐敏感性的方法。

Result: 通过对地理敏感性问题的分析，揭示AI需要更具时空敏感性的对齐设计，而非单一的全球方法。

Conclusion: 随着Agentic AI的出现，必须采取因地制宜和时空敏感的AI对齐方法，以适应不同地域用户的需求和背景，从而确保AI系统能够更好地服务全球社会。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Bench-2-CoP框架，通过194,955个问题的分析评估当前AI标杆测试与EU AI法案要求间的差距，发现重大不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估工具无法充分应对EU AI法案的系统性风险评估需求，亟需解决“标杆-法规”之间的差距问题。

Method: 提出Bench-2-CoP框架，基于LLM-as-judge分析方法，将现有标杆测试的问题映射到EU AI法案定义的模型能力和特性分类中。

Result: 评估域中严重失衡，过度关注行为倾向如幻觉（53.7%）和歧视性偏见（28.9%），而对关键功能能力，如逃避人类监督、自我复制及自主AI发展完全忽视。

Conclusion: 研究首次定量揭示“标杆-法规”评估差距，呼吁政策制定者优化法规，开发者改进下一代评估工具，以促进更安全、合规的AI发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

TL;DR: 本研究使用小型高效的大语言模型(LLM)生成多样化的会话情绪识别(ERC)数据集，以补充现有的ERC基准数据，提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ERC数据稀缺，来源偏向明显，标签主观性强，限制了情绪识别研究的发展。

Method: 使用具备资源效率的小型通用LLM来生成六个全新ERC数据集，其中每个基准数据集有两个针对性数据集，从而补充现有ERC基准。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合生成数据集训练的ERC分类器具有强鲁棒性，在现有基准数据集上取得了统计显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 生成的数据集有效提升了ERC任务性能，解决了数据稀缺和标签不平衡的问题，为ERC研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在改进LLMs推理能力时数据和计算成本高昂，而许多方法依赖启发式或任务特定策略，缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 提出自动化的数据选择管道，从开源推理数据集中利用多维质量指标选择高质量数据；框架集成了SFT与DPO技术。

Result: 相比使用传统方法的模型，InfiAlign通过使用约12%的数据量，实现了与传统模型性能相当的效果；尤其在数学推理任务上表现出显著提升，在AIME 24/25基准测试中平均提升3.89%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了结合数据选择与全阶段后训练方法的有效性，为在规模化与数据高效条件下对大型推理模型进行对齐提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法主要处理非结构化数据，难以有效处理结构化知识图。同时，现有图检索方法在捕获整体图结构和精度控制上存在挑战，影响推理性能。

Method: GRAIL框架结合LLM和随机探索路径过滤方法，采用两阶段训练策略，动态优化每步推理操作，并通过细粒度奖励提升数据效率和训练稳定性。

Result: 实验证明，GRAIL在三个知识图问答数据集上平均准确率提升21.01%，F1值提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL框架通过交互式检索方法，在平衡检索广度和精确度的同时，显著改善了知识图推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化框架来通用性地评估代理任务完成情况，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法忽略了代理决策中的逐步推理或局限于特定领域，缺乏通用性框架。

Method: 设计了一种模块化评估框架，通过任务分解和每个步骤的信息验证来模仿人类评估，并整合各模块产出生成最终评估结论。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准上测试了Magentic-One Actor代理，新的评估系统与人类评估一致性更高，分别提高了4.76％和10.52％。

Conclusion: 验证了模块化评估框架的潜力，可提升代理任务完成评估的通用性和准确性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上由于文本、图像等多模态信号的复杂交互特性，使得辨别害意如讽刺、仇恨言论以及错误信息变得尤为复杂和困难，迫切需要新的方法应对此问题。

Method: 提出了一种多视角代理辩论框架MV-Debate，通过动态反射门控机制联合分析内容。该框架包括四个代理：表面分析器、深度推理器、模态对比器和社交语境主义者，结合迭代辩论和反思优化结果。

Result: 实验在三项基准数据集上表明，MV-Debate在准确性和效率上显著优于现有的单模型和多代理辩论基线方法。

Conclusion: MV-Debate 展示了多代理辩论框架在提高在线安全相关社交意图检测可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前由于数据、奖励设计依赖人类而无法扩展的问题，推进真正自主管理的AI智能发展。

Method: 利用主动推理（AIF）理论取代外部奖励信号，构建基于最小化自由能的内在驱动。同时结合大型语言模型（LLM）作为生成世界模型实现更高效学习。

Result: 提出了一个框架，通过结合AIF和LLM，可使AI代理在经验学习中既能高效学习，又保持对人类价值的对齐。

Conclusion: 整合主动推理与生成模型是通往高效、可发展且受约束的自主AI的重要路径。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Motivation: 解决现有方法无法捕捉学习动态、跟踪进度以及缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 通过构建具有心理特征的学习者（如深度、表面、懒散型以及无人格的通用学习者），模拟一年的学习过程，包括知识获取、策略选择、测试和互动。

Result: 1) 深度学习者实现持续的认知增长；2) 不同学习者的行为和认知模式与心理特征一致；3) 无人格学习者获得高自我效能；4) 基础LLM表现为“勤奋但脆弱的表面学习者”。

Conclusion: LearnerAgent能够有效模拟真实场景并揭示LLMs的行为特征。

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

Motivation: 现有网络对齐模型难以解释对齐决策，限制了模型的可理解性和高风险领域中的适用性。

Method: NAEx通过可学习的边和特征掩码联合参数化图结构和特征空间；并引入优化目标，使得解释既忠实于原始预测，又能比较网络之间的结构和特征相似性。

Result: NAEx在多种基准数据集上展示了其在对齐解释性任务中的有效性与效率，并成功集成了四种网络对齐代表模型。

Conclusion: NAEx框架不仅解决了现有网络对齐模型的解释性问题，还能生成有效的解释，进一步提升了模型的可信度和实用性。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes
and market sentiment. Previous research shows that Echo State Networks (ESNs)
can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in
chaotic periods and show that our approach outperforms existing machine
learning methods by a significant margin. Our findings are consistent with the
Lyapunov exponent analysis, showing that ESNs are robust during chaotic periods
and excel under high chaos compared to Boosting and Na\"ive methods.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理复杂指令、精准控制生成内容以及语义一致性方面存在局限性。提出LumiGen是为了解决这些挑战，尤其是提高生成模型处理复杂和细粒度任务的能力。

Method: LumiGen是一种结合了视-语言模型（LVLM）的迭代改进框架，通过智能提示解析和增强的IPPA模块以及视觉反馈与优化的IVFR模块实现对生成图像的逐步优化。LVLM作为核心组件提供反馈机制，提高生成内容的精细程度。

Result: 基于LongBench-T2I基准测试，LumiGen表现出优异的生成质量，平均得分为3.08，超越现有最先进模型，尤其在文本渲染和姿势表达等关键维度上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LumiGen通过与LVLM的有效集成，显著增强了复杂指令和细节内容的文本到图像生成能力，展示了更可控和高质量的生成能力。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MLES的融合进化搜索和多模态大模型的方法，用于发现具有可解释性的高效控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服深度强化学习中性能与可解释性难以兼顾的问题，特别是在安全关键任务中的应用。

Method: 通过引入一种结合多模态大语言模型和进化搜索的框架MLES，利用视觉反馈和行为分析来优化策略生成过程。

Result: MLES在两个控制任务上与PPO表现相当，但具有更透明的控制逻辑和可追溯的设计流程。

Conclusion: MLES克服了传统方法的局限性，展示了在可解释性和效率上的先进性，并具备广泛适用性和知识迁移能力。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于手工规则的轨迹预测方法缺乏准确性和普适性，而基于深度学习的方法计算成本高且难以泛化，特别是在分布外（OOD）场景下。

Method: TrajEvo结合进化算法和LLM设计预测启发式方法，提出跨代精英采样（Cross-Generation Elite Sampling）和统计反馈回路（Statistics Feedback Loop）以增强多样性及优化预测。

Conclusion: TrajEvo框架实现了快速、可解释且具有普适性的轨迹预测启发式设计，为未来研究提供了新方向并开源代码以支持进一步探索。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

Motivation: 边缘设备资源有限，现有方法在隐私保护、高效个性化和通信成本方面表现不足，亟需一种能提升效率和隐私的内容生成框架。

Method: 通过基于LoRA进行参数高效的本地微调，结合客户端任务需求的相似性进行集群分类，随后进行集群内聚合和跨集群知识交互。此外，在设备端训练个性化模型，在服务器端使用多个LoRA适配器增强全局模型，并通过对提示编码传输减少明文泄露风险。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效地解决了边缘设备多用户个性化内容生成的效率与隐私问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

Motivation: 解决少样本学习在数据稀缺领域（如生物医学、环境科学等）中的局限性。

Method: 建立大型多模态模型数据集M3FD，结合模块化框架M3F，支持多种数据类型，优化少样本学习性能。

Result: 通过在M3FD数据集上微调，M3F模型在少样本任务上的表现优于传统元学习模型。

Conclusion: M3F框架和M3FD数据集显著降低了少样本学习在科学领域的应用门槛，并提高了模型的可扩展性和复现性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol是一个结合属性引导和强化学习的框架，用于提升LLM在分子性质预测任务中的表现，显著超越了现有模型和方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在分子性质预测中的推理常依赖人工设计的提示和样板，然而它们的推理过程有时过于冗长且缺乏相关性。

Method: 提出AttriLens-Mol框架，通过设计格式奖励、计数奖励和理性奖励，利用LLM和工具（如RDKit）引导模型生成与分子属性相关的输出，提升对分子性质的预测能力。

Result: 通过实验显示，AttriLens-Mol在训练7B模型（如R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5和R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1），并用4000个样本就能达到或超越主流监督微调模型和先进的LLM性能，且生成的分子属性用于决策树模型时性能提升显著。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol有效提取相关且有预测性的分子属性，提高了分子性质预测的性能和解释性，展现了该框架的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多模态时间序列预测的鲁棒框架PA-RNet，通过扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，有效分离文本噪声且显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态时间序列预测中的文本噪声会显著影响模型性能，特别是在噪声强度变化或结构不一致时，需要一种方法解决该问题。

Method: 提出PA-RNet框架，包含扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，能分离文本嵌入中的噪声并保持语义一致性，还提供了文本扰动生成管道以评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在各种领域和时间设置下的实验表明，PA-RNet在性能上始终优于现有的先进基线方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet在解决文本噪声问题上表现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是一种有效的多模态时间序列预测框架。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合精度量化(MPQ)框架InfoQ，旨在解决层级比特位数优化的组合优化问题，其搜索阶段无需训练，效率高且效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MPQ方法需要计算复杂的搜索算法或基于局部敏感性代理的方法，这无法全面捕捉量化误差的全局效应，因此需要创新的方法来优化性能并节省资源。

Method: 提出了一个名为InfoQ的新框架，通过量化每层的比特位数并测量互信息的变化来评估敏感性，然后将问题建模为整数线性规划，并在给定资源预算下高效解决。

Result: InfoQ在搜索时间和准确率之间提供了更优的权衡，数据需求比现有方法减少两个数量级，同时在MobileNetV2和ResNet18的高压缩比率下准确率提高了1%。

Conclusion: InfoQ是一种无需重训练的高效MPQ解决方案，以显著更低的资源成本实现了更高的性能，对深度网络的部署有重要意义。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

TL;DR: 本文评估大型语言模型（LLMs）作为动态胰岛素剂量决策的潜力，通过零样本推理与小型强化学习代理（SRAs）进行比较，结果显示部分小型LLMs性能可与SRAs相当甚至更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态胰岛素剂量管理中的应用潜力，减轻当前强化学习方法对工程注入和患者安全性保障的高度依赖。

Method: 利用开源LLMs在1型糖尿病模拟器中的零样本推理性能，与经过训练的小型RL模型进行比较，并设计不同提示策略评估其表现。

Result: 经设计提示后，小型LLMs（如Qwen2.5-7B）在稳定患者群体中实现了与训练的SRAs相当或更优的表现，但在链式推理时会出现剂量过高等关键问题，暴露出算术幻觉、时间误解等局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床工作流中的应用须持谨慎却乐观态度，通过目标提示设计、严谨验证以及结合生理建模的混合方法，有望实现安全和有效的临床决策支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种关注公平性的电力恢复策略EPOPR，显著减少了停电中断时间并降低了社区间的不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端天气事件频发，现有电力恢复方法因忽视弱势群体的请求缺乏公平性。

Method: 设计了包含公平一致性分位数回归和时空注意力强化学习的预测-优化框架EPOPR。

Result: 实验表明，EPOPR平均减少停电时间3.60%，降低社区间不公平性14.19%。

Conclusion: EPOPR在保障电力恢复高效性的同时，提高了社区间的公平性，优于现有基准方法。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 F3CRec 的框架，用于解决在联邦学习（FL）中应对非平稳数据流的问题，同时保持推荐质量和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦推荐（FedRec）方法无法很好地处理非平稳数据流，而持续学习推荐（CLRec）方法虽然能够适应用户偏好的变化，但存在集中数据访问的问题，因此需要一种能够整合联邦学习和持续学习优势的解决方案。

Method: 提出了 Federated Continual Recommendation（FCRec）任务，并设计了一个框架 F3CRec，包括客户端的自适应重放内存和服务器端的逐项时间均值机制，以在隐私保护的前提下实现知识的保留和适应。

Result: F3CRec 在实验中表现出优于现有方法的能力，能够在联邦环境中保持推荐质量的同时适应时间变化。

Conclusion: F3CRec 平衡了知识保留和适应性，成功解决了联邦持续推荐任务中隐私保护与推荐质量的矛盾。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车派单系统偏向提高运营商收益，忽视了乘客与司机体验，该研究希望通过引入人本理念改善此问题。

Method: 提出了一种新型多智能体强化学习算法Habic（包括多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络），用于在保障效率的情况下优化乘客公平性与司机偏好。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进基线，HCRide将系统效率提升2.02%、公平性提升5.39%、司机偏好提升10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide系统实现了效率与人为因素的平衡，为人性化网约车系统设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

### [192] [Multi-Stage Knowledge-Distilled VGAE and GAT for Robust Controller-Area-Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04845)
*Robert Frenken,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Hanqin Zhang,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多阶段入侵检测框架，结合了无监督的异常检测和监督的图学习，用于汽车CAN通信的网络安全。实验表明该方法在多数据集上表现出色，有效解决了数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAN协议广泛应用于车载通信，但缺乏内置的安全功能，容易受到网络攻击。因此，需要开发专门的入侵检测方法以提高CAN网络的安全性，尤其是处理数据集的不平衡性和提高攻击分类性能。

Method: 作者提出了一种结合变分图自编码器（VGAE）和知识蒸馏的图注意力网络（KD-GAT）的多阶段检测框架。首先将CAN总线活动表示为图序列，利用VGAE选择性欠采样来解决类不平衡问题，然后使用GAT进行分类，并提供可选的分数层融合机制。

Result: 所提方法在公开的六个CAN入侵数据集上进行测试，包括Car-Hacking, Car-Survival和can-train-and-test数据集。该方法在数据不平衡条件下表现优异，平均F1分数提高16.2%，在严重不平衡场景下最高提升达55%。

Conclusion: 该框架集成了多种技术方法，验证了其在CAN网络入侵检测中的高效性和准确性，具有实际的应用价值。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了OPTQ及其变体在量化误差上的理论界限，并扩展到Qronos算法，提供了新的理论依据和优化指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OPTQ被广泛采用，但缺乏严格的理论保证，本文试图填补这一空白，提供量化误差的理论边界。

Method: 对OPTQ和Qronos算法进行量化误差分析，推导非渐近的2-范数误差界，同时对于随机变体，还建立了更强的无穷范数误差界限。

Result: 提供了OPTQ及其随机变体，以及Qronos算法在量化误差上的量化边界理论，揭示其实证优势的原因。

Conclusion: 分析为OPTQ和Qronos算法提供了理论解释，指导其设计优化及参数选择，并解释了一些实用启发的有效性。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Agnostics的语言无关后训练管道，提升低资源编程语言的代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高资源编程语言的代码生成性能优秀，但低资源语言因训练数据缺少和后处理难度而表现较差，迫切需要通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出Agnostics管道，通过基于行为的验证器和通用的机器学习步骤，实现对不同语言的统一后处理训练，不需要为每种语言单独开发数据集和基础设施。

Result: 对五种低资源语言（Lua、Julia、R、OCaml、Fortran）进行实验，显著提升模型性能，并在多语言评测基准中达到了新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Agnostics方法有效消除了低资源编程语言后处理的工程瓶颈，将后续训练简化为编辑基础配置文件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

TL;DR: 本文提出 Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO)，通过引入来自信号处理的强归纳偏置改进神经算子学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于频域卷积的神经算子（如FNO）虽然在许多问题上表现出色，但由于傅里叶变换的周期性假设等限制，存在一定不足。

Method: 提出一种新架构HNO，利用Hilbert变换将输入信号映射到其解析表示，并显式提取瞬时幅度和相位信息进行学习，同时在此表示上执行谱卷积。

Result: 理论上展示了HNO如何能够更好地建模因果性、对相位敏感以及非平稳系统的算子问题。

Conclusion: HNO提供了一种新的设计思路，为信号处理理论和神经网络架构的结合提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经网络的均值场理论主要研究具有无限宽度的网络，本研究旨在探讨是否可以直接对概率分布实施动态操作，推动理论与应用的创新。

Method: 利用高斯混合模型和Wasserstein梯度流理论，推导出概率测度的训练动态并引入新的“高斯混合层”，整合到神经网络结构中进行实验验证。

Result: 通过简单的分类任务实验，验证了高斯混合层的效果，其测试性能与两层全连接网络相当。

Conclusion: 高斯混合层的动态行为显著不同于传统全连接层，尤其在接近均值场理论的条件下，展示了其新的可能性与优势。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 空气污染是全球性问题，其中地表臭氧（O3）的趋势难以建模。本文提出一种基于深度学习并结合不确定性量化的U-Net模型，用于修正臭氧误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模型无法以足够的精度捕捉地表臭氧的趋势，而深度学习模型虽能模拟复杂的气候模式，但缺乏决策所需的可解释性。

Method: 通过引入不确定性量化的U-Net架构，使用贝叶斯和分位数回归方法预测与臭氧相关的化学数据模型残差。

Result: 展示了该技术在北美与欧洲区域臭氧残差估算的能力，并评估了哪些地面站点适合进行模型误差修正，同时讨论了土地利用信息的影响。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提升了地表臭氧误差建模的能力，为污染模型改进提供了决策支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Motivation: 空气污染是全球最大的人类疾病环境风险，特别是表面臭氧的建模在对人类健康有影响的尺度上仍然是个挑战。遗留的模型误差限制了物理模型的实际应用，因此需要更精确的预测模型。

Conclusion: 结果不仅有助于提升臭氧的计算模型，还能深化对影响城市尺度臭氧偏差因素的科学理解，为改进环境政策提供数据支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF)的框架，通过引入历史性多变量水文数据来提高水文预测的效果，特别用于水位预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习时间序列模型在水文领域应用较少，且它们在处理不同数据集或领域时的泛化能力有限。

Method: 设计了RAF框架，通过从外部存档中检索历史相似的多变量水文数据来丰富模型输入，提高上下文感知能力和预测精度，同时无需对模型进行特定任务的再训练或微调。

Result: 在以埃弗格莱兹湿地的真实数据为基础的水位预测评估中，RAF框架显著提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: RAF方法展示了其在环境水文学中的巨大潜力，为采用自适应AI方法管理生态系统提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Motivation: 当前对新生儿癫痫检测的AI模型评估存在不一致和偏差，缺乏严谨验证的专家级性能声明限制了临床应用的可能性。

Method: 通过使用真实和合成的癫痫标注，对不同的性能指标、共识策略和专家等效性测试进行了系统评估，特别研究了类别不平衡、评价者一致性和人数对这些方法的影响。

Result: Matthews和Pearson的相关系数在类别不平衡条件下表现优于AUC；共识方法对评价者的数量及其一致性敏感；Fleiss k的多评价者图灵测试更准确反映专家级AI性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种集中在新生儿癫痫检测AI模型评估的框架，包括至少一个平衡指标、常见的敏感性与特异性指标、多评价者图灵测试结果在验证集中的表现。这些建议为临床验证提供了基础。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Conclusion: 建议在现代转移学习系统设计中，应综合考虑性能和可复制性，引入可复制性感知的设计机制。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的模型，特别是微调的ELECTRA模型，可以有效改进仇恨言论的自动检测性能，但仍存在针对特定语言现象的困难需要克服。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

Motivation: 当前DAL算法在分布偏移和数据不平衡等复杂问题中面临挑战，且缺少统一的平台进行公平与系统的评估。

Method: 作者开发了ALScope平台，集成了多个数据集和算法，并支持对关键实验因素的灵活配置，提供了在不同条件下对DAL算法进行全面评估的工具。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，作者发现DAL算法在领域和任务场景间的表现差异较大，特别在不平衡和开放集场景中仍有改进空间；部分算法虽然性能良好但选择时间较长。

Conclusion: ALScope平台为DAL算法提供了公平且全面的评估环境，同时指出了现有算法在非标准场景中的局限性并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Motivation: 在SimulST系统中，同时实现高质量翻译和低延迟的平衡具有挑战性。作者提出了一种基于信息增益的策略，以决定等待更多输入的必要性，从而优化翻译系统表现。

Method: 通过信息论原理推导出REINA损失函数，训练一个自适应策略，并基于现有的非流式翻译模型进行优化。在实际实验中，将REINA用于多个语言方向（法语、西班牙语、德语和英语）进行翻译系统训练。

Result: 利用REINA训练的模型达到了同规模模型的SOTA流式翻译效果，并引入了一个新的流式效率指标。与之前的方法相比，其延迟和质量权衡性能提高了多达21%。

Conclusion: 通过REINA损失函数优化，可以显著提升SimulST系统的翻译质量与延迟的平衡表现，使其在开源数据训练下达到了当前领先水平。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Conclusion: SEA提供了更广泛的调整范围和更一致的多样性改变，同时理论边界更严谨，为集成学习性能提供了新的优化机制。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种非凸随机优化的压缩去中心化算法，通过动量加速和消息压缩实现快速收敛和通信成本降低，并取得了优异的实验性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计能够控制共识误差、压缩误差和动量梯度偏差的高效去中心化优化算法，解决非凸随机优化问题。

Method: 提出两种算法：(1) 针对梯度有界的场景，设计了一种压缩去中心化自适应方法；(2) 针对数据异质性场景，设计了一种压缩去中心化重球方法，结合梯度跟踪技术。

Result: 两种算法都取得了最优收敛率、线性加速和拓扑结构无关的算法参数选择，并在深度神经网络训练中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文算法在非凸随机优化中有效结合动量加速和通信压缩，兼具理论保证和优异实验性能，首次实现去中心化自适应随机梯度算法的通信压缩。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于滤波器组的EEG基础模型MENDR，改善解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG基础模型在泛化性能上已有进展，但其透明性和可解释性不足，且忽略了时频域特征提取的重要性。

Method: 提出基于Riemannian Manifold Transformer架构的MENDR模型，结合滤波器组和离散小波分解方法处理EEG数据。

Result: MENDR通过几何椭球可视化EEG嵌入，支持信号重构，在多项任务上接近当前最优表现且参数量较少。

Conclusion: MENDR在提高EEG分析效率和解释性上具有潜力，为临床应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

Conclusion: RCUKF解决了传统模型在复杂环境中建模失效的难题，为高维和混沌系统的状态估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中存在内在和跨模态的虚假关联，影响模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出基于因果理论的多关系多模态因果干预（MMCI）模型，利用多关系图建模多模态输入，并通过注意力机制分离因果特征与快捷特征，通过后门调整结合这些特征以实现稳健预测。

Result: MMCI在多项标准MSA数据集和OOD测试集上抑制偏差并提高性能。

Conclusion: MMCI通过因果调整有效解决多模态间的偏差问题，提高了在分布迁移条件下的预测可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了R-Zero，一个完全自主的框架，通过自我生成训练数据和相互作用实现大型语言模型(LLMs)的自进化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs训练方法严重依赖于人工标注数据，限制了AI系统向超越人类智能方向发展的潜力。R-Zero的动机是解除这种对人工任务的依赖，实现完全自主的AI模型演化。

Method: R-Zero框架通过一个基LLM生成两个独立的角色模型：挑战者(Challenger)和解题者(Solver)。通过交互式优化，挑战者提出解决能力边缘的任务，解题者尝试解决这些任务，并通过此过程相互促进。

Result: R-Zero显著提升了推理能力。例如，在Qwen3-4B-Base模型上，数学推理和通用领域推理能力分别提升了+6.49和+7.54。

Conclusion: R-Zero可以完全自主地生成训练数据并实现模型的自演化，这为摆脱人工标注负担，提升人工智能能力开辟了一种新途径。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的LLM微调方法需要大量数据和计算成本，且现有的课程学习或数据选择方法的可扩展性和普适性有限。

Method: 设计了SPaRFT框架，先通过聚类减少数据冗余，再利用多臂老虎机算法基于模型表现动态选择训练数据。

Result: 实验在多种推理基准上验证了SPaRFT能以至多减少100倍样本的情况下达到甚至超越当前最先进基线的准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的、以表现为驱动的训练课题能够以最低资源需求解锁LLM强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Motivation: 增强现实虽改善了任务性能，但可能因诱发认知隧道效应而降低情境意识，这在安全关键场景中尤其危险。因此需研究如何在AR指导下平衡用户的任务执行与情境意识需求。

Method: 基于Magic Leap 2开发AR应用程序，利用眼动追踪技术采集数据，并引入FixGraphPool图神经网络模型分析注视与扫视事件的时空特性，以预测用户情境意识水平。

Result: 研究发现，较高情境意识水平与更大的扫视幅度、更快的扫视速度、较少注视虚拟内容的频率和比例有关。FixGraphPool模型预测情境意识精度达83.0%，优于特征提取方法及时间序列模型。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪对情境意识建模具有潜力，提出的FixGraphPool模型为设计确保用户安全与情境意识的AR系统提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Conclusion: 该研究通过重新解释遗忘动力学，创新性地推进了深度学习知识迁移的边界，展示了通过KNOW方法优化权重预测的潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Method: 通过一个可学习的Lyapunov函数定义下降方向，结合消息传递学习的切向分量，将能量梯度下降与切向演化分解为正交动态。

Result: 在不同节点、图分类和回归基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 能量函数与切向流相结合的机制对图神经网络学习是高效的，并且具有较强的通用性。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Motivation: 现有的基于去除单一样本（LOO）策略的数据归因方法局限于局部解释，且许多方法缺乏基线定义，导致在解释灵活性上的不足。

Conclusion: Integrated Influence方法比现有方法生成了更可靠的归因结果，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

Motivation: 解决偏好学习中的冷启动问题，特别是在缺少标签数据的社会计算和经济分析中。

Conclusion: 该框架缓解了偏好学习中的冷启动问题，提升了样本效率并扩大了其在数据受限环境下的应用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多种设置下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 这种框架证明了从多重弱监督信号中联合学习的潜力，为处理标注受限的数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的强化学习框架，用于提升函数调用任务的策略优化，解决了探索不足、推理结构化不足和参数验证不足等关键挑战，并在实际测试中取得了良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型无法在函数调用任务中制定鲁棒的推理策略，因此需要新方法解决探索、推理和验证方面的不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于策略优化的强化学习框架，采用两阶段数据准备管道，通过迭代LLM评估和抽象语法树验证生成高质量训练样本，并使用策略优化和熵引导的探索改善模型性能。

Result: 在Berkeley函数调用排行榜中取得86.02%的整体准确率，显著优于传统方法6%，尤其在代码预训练模型中表现强势。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效提升函数调用任务的性能，特别是对代码预训练模型效果显著，并将开放代码、模型与数据集。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

*Thinh Nguyen,Trung Phan,Binh T. Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了联邦学习(FL)在分布式训练模式下的挑战，引入了一种新模式：层次化联邦领域泛化(HFedDG)，并提出了HFedATM方法以应对领域迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在扩展性上存在局限，尤其大型设备数量增长会对中央服务器造成过大负担；现有层次化联邦学习虽改善部分问题，但未能妥善应对不同客户端和站点之间的数据分布差异(领域迁移)。

Method: 提出HFedATM，一种分两步的层次聚合方法，首先利用Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment对不同站点的模型卷积滤波器进行对齐，然后通过Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation对齐后的模型进行融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，HFedATM显著提升了现有联邦领域泛化基线模型在多个数据集上的性能，并维持了计算与通讯的效率。

Conclusion: HFedATM不仅提升了模型在面对领域迁移场景的性能，还通过理论分析展示其较传统方法更小的泛化误差界限，更快的收敛速度以及更稳定的训练表现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

*Yahong Yang,Juncai He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间中的逼近性，发现其性能优于传统数值方法，并提出统一的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络在Sobolev空间中的逼近能力，并与传统数值方法进行比较，以改进PDEs的求解方法。

Method: 通过分析，证明了深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间$W^{n,\infty}$中以$W^{m,p}$为误差度量的逼近能力，并研究了神经网络在PDEs解中的表现。

Result: 深度神经网络展现了"超收敛"特性，其逼近性能超越有限元和谱方法，且能够更好地拟合PDEs的弱解。

Conclusion: 此研究填补了神经网络在PDEs误差估计理论中的空白，为科学计算提供了一种高效且统一的框架。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

### [223] [PSEO: Optimizing Post-hoc Stacking Ensemble Through Hyperparameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05144)
*Beicheng Xu,Wei Liu,Keyao Ding,Yupeng Lu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PSEO的框架，通过后处理叠加集成优化解决AutoML中的CASH问题，优于16种方法，平均测试排名2.96。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决传统CASH问题仅针对单一模型优化而忽视针对任务特性调整集成策略的问题。

Method: 通过二次规划进行基础模型选择，引入两种机制提升多层叠加潜力，创建超参数空间并优化后处理集成策略。

Result: 在80个公开数据集上，PSEO的平均测试排名为2.96，优于近期AutoML系统及先进集成学习方法。

Conclusion: PSEO方法有效解决了CASH问题中单模型优化与任务特性适配的不足，为AutoML提供了更优的后处理集成策略。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于领域驱动的强化学习（RL）指标，用于优化理性基于代理的模型，并通过建模疫情中的口罩使用、疫苗接种与封锁行为进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对基于代理的模型和理性基于代理的模型中，优化算法（如强化学习）的性能评估困难，特别是在复杂和随机性强的系统中缺乏标准化的衡量指标。

Method: 开发领域驱动的强化学习评价指标，并结合面向领域的奖励与传统及先进的指标体系，在疫情建模中使用理性的基于代理模型进行测试与验证。

Conclusion: 领域驱动的强化学习指标在优化理性模型中展示出有效性，并能提升优化质量。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

*Thinh Nguyen,Le Huy Khiem,Van-Tuan Tran,Khoa D Doan,Nitesh V Chawla,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的pFedDSH框架，通过中央超网络和批次特定掩码有效实现个性化联邦学习，适应动态客户端加入并提高知识传递效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化联邦学习方法假设客户端参与是静态的，但现实中客户端会动态增加，而需要解决这一问题。

Method: 引入pFedDSH框架，基于中央超网络和客户端嵌入向量，利用批次特定掩码保持知识稳定，结合数据无关的回放策略促进知识回传。

Result: 在CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet实验中，pFedDSH性能优于最先进的pFL和联邦持续学习基准。

Conclusion: pFedDSH框架在现有客户端性能稳定性、对新客户端的适应性及神经网络资源的高效利用方面表现出色，为动态客户端场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

TL;DR: 一种新的听觉注意检测方法S$^2$M-Former，结合生物启发的神经网络设计，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于脑电图的听觉注意检测方法在协同利用多样化特征和能效限制方面的不足。

Method: 设计了一种名为S$^2$M-Former的新型尖峰对称混合框架，其创新在于采用平行的空间和频率结构，减轻传统三维操作的负担，以及通过轻量化设计节约计算资源。

Result: S$^2$M-Former在三个数据集上的多种实验设定中达到了与现有最先进方法相当的解码准确性，同时显著减少了参数和能耗。

Conclusion: 该方法展现出其在低功耗和高性能听觉注意检测中的潜力，有助于开发高效的神经控制听觉设备。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的推断时对齐方法HIA，用于解决对齐质量与计算成本之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的对齐需要高成本的微调或推断，迫使在对齐质量与计算费用间作出权衡。

Method: HIA是一种免调优、黑盒兼容的方法，通过轻量的提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤技术来减少推断调用次数，同时保持对齐质量。

Result: 在HelpSteer和ComPRed数据集上，HIA在相同推断预算下比最佳N抽样、束搜索和贪婪搜索基线在多目标、目标条件任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: HIA在低推断预算下也具备实用性，为可扩展、个性化的大语言模型部署提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Motivation: 在机器学习中选择性能最佳算法时，现有方法难以通过基准数据集有效鉴别出对未来数据表现最优的算法，尤其是当算法间差异较小时。

Method: 将问题建模为多项分布的子集选择问题，提出新框架并设计了渐近和有限样本下的算法方案，同时提供了匹配的理论下界。

Result: 新框架与算法在理论和实验中均显著优于现有方法，表现出良好的效果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方案能够高效实现高置信度下的最小化子集选择，为算法优选问题提供了新的理论和方法支持。

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Motivation: 为解决现有HAR模型在智能手机佩戴位置变动情况下性能下降的问题，研究者旨在开发一种准确且低开销的模型，专注于多样化日常活动识别，同时针对多发性硬化症患者的数据进行训练和验证。

Method: 采用ResNet框架构建HAR模型，利用智能手机传感器数据进行训练和评估。数据来自健康个体与多发性硬化症患者，并包含内部与公开数据集，分析了多个不同佩戴位置的条件下模型的表现。

Result: 模型在检测步态与非步态活动时，分别达到98.4%和99.6%的高准确率，与现有ResNet模型性能相当。在日常活动识别方面，模型与现有方法相比表现更优，提升了4.3%准确率（96.2%对比91.9%），且在9种佩戴条件下表现出优异的稳定性。

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文旨在解决时间依赖型偏微分方程(PDEs)长时间建模与推断的挑战，通过引入PITI-DeepONet网络架构克服传统方法面临的局限性，显著提高了精确性和时间积累误差的控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在长期时间推断中表现不佳，全展开方法(FR)无法有效捕捉因果关系，而自回归方法(AR)易受到误差累积的影响。这种局限性会限制长期建模的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种物理信息时间积分深度算子网络(PITI-DeepONet)，通过同时学习时间导数算子及利用经典时间步进方法迭代推进，同时在训练过程中结合物理信息或数据驱动的目标函数，提供稳定和精确的长时间演化能力。

Result: 在标准问题中的实验显示，与FR相比，平均相对L2误差减少84%到87%，与AR相比减少79%到98%，在一维热方程、一维Burgers方程和二维Allen-Cahn方程中均表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet通过超越传统FR和AR方法，为复杂时间依赖偏微分方程的长期可靠集成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在金融应用中幻觉现象严重，尤其在处理依赖上下文、精确数字和专有表格数据时，现有评估标准难以覆盖这些特性。

Method: 设计了一个基于真实财务文档的上下文感知掩码预测任务框架，自动生成数据集，构建来自S&P 500年报的新评估数据集，并对LLMs进行全面幻觉模式分析。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展的方法学，为内部LLM评估提供了工具，并为构建更可信赖的金融生成式AI系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告系统中检索阶段无法访问实时出价信息，导致平台收入和广告主效果次优。

Method: 通过BAR框架将出价纳入检索评分函数，使用单调性约束学习、多任务蒸馏、异步近线推理和任务注意力精炼模块来优化表现。

Result: 在阿里巴巴广告平台的实验和全面部署中，平台收入增加4.32%，正向运营广告曝光提升22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR框架有效解决了信息不一致问题，显著提升了广告系统的经济效益和用户体验。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

*Ahmad Saeed Khan,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的倾向分数权重方法(DFW)，通过调整样本权重更有效地模拟随机对照试验，解决选择偏差问题，且表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于倾向分数的权重方法在处理选择偏差和治疗效果估计时效果受限于数据质量和倾向分数估计器的准确性，由此需要一种更稳定、更有效的权重方法。

Method: 提出了去混淆因子加权算法(DFW)，根据去混淆因子构建稳定的样本权重，优先考虑低混淆样本并降低高混淆样本的影响，从而改善协变量平衡和权重方差问题。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验显示，DFW在协变量平衡和治疗效果估计方面均优于现有方法，如IPW和CBPS。

Conclusion: DFW是一种有效的倾向分数权重方法，可以更好地模拟随机对照试验，同时适用于二元和多重治疗场景，为因果推断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去中心化的点对点（P2P）联邦学习框架LIGHTYEAR，以解决传统联邦学习中的局限性，展示了其在有对抗和异构环境下的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习存在单点故障、个性化不足和对分布变化的鲁棒性差等问题，并且在依赖低层次参数差异进行更新选择时容易出错，且无法赋予客户端更多控制权。

Method: 作者设计了一个去中心化的P2P框架LIGHTYEAR，并引入了使用本地验证集计算的agreement score，用以测量更新的语义对准程度，并结合正则化项进行聚合，从而稳定训练过程。

Result: 通过两个数据集的实验验证表明，LIGHTYEAR在客户端性能上优于集中式基准方法和现有P2P方法，尤其在对抗性和异构条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: 去中心化、通过本地推断指导的个性化聚合策略可以显著提高联邦学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT研究专注于减少全精度模型上的量化误差，但从未尝试突破全精度模型精度的上限。

Method: 提出了一个新范式，提高全精度模型的精度再进行高效的2位量化，使用复杂域表征优势，量化权重为{±1, ±i}的复杂值表示，支持无需乘法的推理。

Result: Fairy$\pm i$在PPL和下游任务上超越现有2位量化方法的精度上限，并具备存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在极低比特约束下实现高精度LLM，打开了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

TL;DR: Cross-LoRA 通过两个关键组件：LoRA-Align 和 LoRA-Shift，实现了 LoRA 模块在不同基础模型之间的数据无关迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PEFT方法无法在异构的预训练大语言模型上通用，受限于基础模型架构。

Method: 提出Cross-LoRA框架，通过LoRA-Align（基于SVD进行子空间对齐）和LoRA-Shift（将权重更新投射到目标模型）实现数据无关LoRA迁移，无需额外训练数据，用时少。

Result: 在ARCs、OBOA和HellaSwag数据集上，Cross-LoRA较基础模型有高达5.26%的性能提升，并在其它基准测试中表现与直接训练LoRA适配器相当。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA实现了高效的LoRA迁移，适用于多种模型，成本低，可在通用GPU上运行，性能优异。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医学问答和编程中表现出色，但在生成可解释的CPs方面的潜力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过分析六种不同复杂度的临床表型，评估LLMs的初始性能，并提出一种“生成-执行-调试-指导”策略，利用数据反馈指导LLMs迭代生成更准确的CPs。

Result: 结果表明，结合迭代学习的LLMs可生成可解释且较为准确的CP，性能接近当前最先进的机器学习方法，同时需要显著更少的训练样本。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成可解释的可计算表型方面展示出潜力，特别是通过迭代学习策略，可以以更少的训练数据实现较高的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的基于专家混合分解（MoBE）的方法，解决了MoE架构在压缩过程中准确性下降的问题，能在较低的准确性损失下显著减少参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前大规模语言模型使用专家混合架构时的部署内存需求过高问题，提出减少模型参数的方法，同时避免显著损失准确性。

Method: 通过将每个专家的上/门矩阵进行秩分解，矩阵A特化于每个专家，而较大的矩阵B被重新表达为一组共享基矩阵的线性组合，并通过最小化重建误差优化分解。

Result: 通过实验表明，MoBE方法相比其他MoE压缩技术，能够以显著较低的准确性损失实现24%-30%的参数量减少。

Conclusion: MoBE方法在保证较小准确性损失的前提下有效压缩了MoE架构，为解决大模型的部署困难问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Conclusion: LSTM-RF模型解决单一模型预测能力不足的问题，为海洋生态变量的高频预测提供创新方案。

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

Conclusion: FlowState通过其新颖架构和预训练策略显著提高了时间序列预测中的泛化能力与计算效率，成为当前领域的最新标杆。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Motivation: 传统的监督微调方式难以捕捉隐式反馈信号，而提升用户满意度和上下文相关性是对话推荐系统的重要目标。

Conclusion: 隐式信号对齐方法可以实现可扩展的用户自适应对话推荐系统设计，有效提升系统性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that

Conclusion: 该研究提供了深度学习大规模批量训练的理论见解及实践指导，为提高训练效率与模型推广能力提供了新的途径。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Conclusion: 运用关键批量大小理论并联合调整学习率和批量大小的策略能够有效提升SGD的收敛性能。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

Conclusion: ASkDAgger框架有效利用学员计划和不确定性信息，提高了互动模仿学习的效率及适应性，并为未来语言任务的研究提供了范例工具。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

### [248] [Optimal Corpus Aware Training for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05364)
*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT)，通过优化Corpus Aware Training (CAT)以实现更高精度和轻量级的模型调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的CAT训练方法通过引入语料数据信息提升模型表现，但需要预先定义高质量数据组，可能导致误差和效率问题。

Method: OCAT方法基于预训练的CAT模型，将大部分参数冻结，仅优化与语料相关的小部分参数，减少过拟合风险并提高训练效率。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别相较于原始训练方式实现+3.6和+1.8 chrF提升，并在精调过程中表现出对超参数较低敏感度。

Conclusion: OCAT提高了模型调优的效率和精度，与现有的精调技术相比，表现持平或稍有优势，具有较好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

### [249] [Latent Preference Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05367)
*Newton Mwai,Emil Carlsson,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种放宽假设的潜在强化学习方法，允许同一潜在状态下的不同实例具有不同的奖励分布，但偏好顺序需一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化任务中，从头开始的探索学习成本高，尤其是单个个体只有少量决策点时。需要一种减少探索成本的更灵活的方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于偏好顺序的潜在强化学习方法，并设计了相应的后验采样算法。

Result: 该方法在奖励分布确定的情况下表现与现有潜在强化学习方法相当；在同一潜在状态下奖励尺度不同的情况下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法放宽了现有假设，更适用于奖励分布变化较大的场景，为个性化任务提供了更有效的探索机制。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

*Jie Xiao,Shaoduo Gan,Changyuan Fan,Qingnan Ren,Alfred Long,Yuchen Zhang,Rymon Yu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Echo系统，旨在通过分离推理与训练过程优化大语言模型的RL训练流程，同时保持统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL训练中推理与训练被置于同一GPU集群，需要频繁切换上下文，导致效率降低且不符合SPMD假设。

Method: 提出Echo系统，将推理与训练阶段分离，采用异构硬件；引入两种同步协议：顺序拉取模式和异步推拉模式，以优化硬件利用和最小化偏差。

Result: 在三个RL任务上测试，Echo与完全共驻Verl基线在收敛速度和最终奖励上表现相当，并实现了将轨迹生成卸载到边缘硬件。

Conclusion: 结果表明，使用分布式异构资源的大规模LLM RL训练能够达到数据中心级性能。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络容易受后门攻击的问题，提供一种强有效的防御机制。

Method: 通过NT减少受污染数据的危害，利用高精度教师模型和较高信心学生模型进行相互学习，最终得到净化的学生模型。

Result: 在6种后门攻击下，使用少量干净样本成功防御，性能优于5种最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种有效且具有较强性能的防御方式，可以在少量干净数据下进行对深度神经网络的后门防御。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Motivation: 深度学习中的学习率是一个关键超参数，其理想值依赖于问题且可能在训练中变化。研究动机在于改进学习率的动态调整方法，提高优化效果。

Result: 实验基准测试表明，提出的方法在某些情况下能够更加有效地调整学习率，提高优化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究澄清了具体情境下自适应学习率策略的优势与适用性，并提出一种更合适Adam优化器的方法。

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了生成的质量和多样性，还在计算效率上显著优于基于扩散的方法。

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了NegBio-VAE，一种基于负二项分布的VAE扩展，用于更准确地建模生物神经元的尖峰通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VAE模型，如Poisson-VAE，无法捕捉神经元尖峰通信的高度变异性，且受限于均值等于方差的刚性假设。

Method: 引入负二项分布作为建模手段，允许尖峰计数的高度变异性；提出了两种ELBO优化策略和两种适配负二项分布的微分重参数方法。

Result: 通过增加一个离散参数，NegBio-VAE较Poisson模型实现更高的重建精度，显著提升了尖峰数据的建模能力。

Conclusion: 这一研究证明显式建模尖峰数据的过分散特性对于提高重建性能是非常关键的。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 联邦学习（FL）的常见方法FedAvg在优化多数客户的同时未能公平对待少数客户。本文提出了一种称为CR-FMOL的新框架，通过引入锥形偏好约束，实现客户层面的帕累托最优性。实验显示CR-FMOL在非IID数据集上的公平性优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedAvg在联邦学习中倾向于优化多数客户，但忽略了少数客户的需求，导致客户公平性不足。

Method: 提出了Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL)框架，利用锥形偏好约束和联邦多梯度下降算法实现客户层面的帕累托最优性。

Result: 在非IID数据集上，CR-FMOL提升了客户公平性。尽管初期性能略差于FedAvg，但经过足够轮次训练后，两者可达到相近精度。

Conclusion: CR-FMOL为联邦学习中的客户公平性提供了新方法，兼顾了模型性能和公平分配的需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型需针对专业任务进行优化，而现有方法（如GRPO）未考虑回复间的语义交互，存在改进空间。

Method: 通过结构因果模型(SCM)分析候选回复间依赖，提出因果投影和GCPO框架，包括因果调整奖励和KL正则化项，优化策略性能。

Result: 实验证明，GCPO在多个推理基准上优于现有方法，如GRPO。

Conclusion: 考虑因果结构的优化方法GCPO能显著提升推理任务的性能，并为专业领域模型优化提供一种新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有生存分析通常将竞争风险当作截尾，可能引入偏差且未充分认识其后果。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，用于量化将竞争风险错误当作截尾行为所引起的误差，并分析对预测性能和算法公平性的影响，同时结合心血管管理案例进行经验分析。

Result: 发现将竞争风险当作截尾会系统性高估风险，且在不同群体中会产生偏差，导致高风险个体受影响更大，从而加剧不公平性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，忽视竞争风险不可取，这会降低模型的准确性、扩大风险估计的不平等现象，建议生存分析模型需正视这一问题以改进预测并减少不公平性。

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

Motivation: 当前的蒙特卡洛树搜索方法难以有效地应对决策中的极端高风险以及尾部风险问题。

Result: 理论上证明了两种方法具有PAC尾部安全保证和健壮的回报、稳定性，实验中性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究为高风险场景下的决策提供了有效保障，同时提升了奖励和稳定性表现。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Method: 采用基于时间序列Transformer的EnergyPatchTST模型，包含多尺度特征提取、概率预测、未来变量整合及预训练与微调机制。

Result: EnergyPatchTST在公共能源数据上的实验表明，与常用方法相比预测误差降低7-12%，并提供了可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST在改进能源领域时间序列预测方面实现了重大突破，为未来能源规划提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

Motivation: 探索神经网络内在表示的形态是如何与输入数据的复杂性及其解决问题相关联的，这在现有研究中仍然不清晰。

Method: 通过对MLP模型使用修剪、二值化、噪声注入、符号翻转和随机化五种数据无关的探针技术，并分析MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上不同任务难度的分类问题。

Result: 易任务模型在权值二值化后保持了鲁棒性，而难任务模型则下降到随机水平。此外，二值化后的难任务模型经过低量级边的修剪，性能会经历明显的相变。中等强度的噪声注入甚至能提高准确性，且仅维护符号结构（不依赖于具体权量）即可获得高准确性。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了签名双分拓扑在学习表示中的关键作用，并为基于任务复杂性的模型压缩和解释提供了实际策略。

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

Method: 采用信息论中的f-互信息措施作为核心工具，证明其在自然条件下具有独特的抗游戏性，实验验证了其在不同AI任务评价中的有效性。

Result: 在10个不同领域中，信息论机制相较于现有评估实践显示出10-100倍的抗操控性并实现了对忠实与策略性代理的完美区分，而传统的LLM评估方式可能偏向错误结果。

Conclusion: 文中提出的评价机制在面对对抗性操控时具有显著优势，并结合了压缩率与性能之间的倒U型关系，为AI评估提供了新视角和理论支持。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

Motivation: 现有临床预测模型普遍忽略了电子健康记录中患者与医疗系统交互过程的重要性（称为临床存在），导致模型性能下降及跨场景移植能力有限。

Method: 提出一种多任务循环神经网络模型，该模型能够同时建模观察时间间隔、数据缺失过程以及生存结果，理论上证明了该方法在临床存在变化的情况下提高模型跨场景使用性能的原因。

Conclusion: 合理利用临床存在信息不仅能提升预测模型的性能，还能增强其适应不同场景的能力，从而开发更通用的临床预测模型。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的架构MoMA，用于利用多语言模型处理多模态EHR数据的临床预测任务，结果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态EHR数据有效整合和预测建模的困难。

Method: 采用多个大语言模型代理（LLM agents），通过专家代理将非文本数据转化为结构化文本，由聚合代理合并生成多模态总结，最终由预测代理进行临床预测。

Result: 在真实数据集上的三个任务中表现优于最先进方法，展示了该方法跨任务的准确性和灵活性。

Conclusion: MoMA框架有效整合多模态数据，显著提升了预测任务的表现，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

*Kristina P. Sinaga,Sara Colantonio,Miin-Shen Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了两种多视图聚类算法：AMVFCM-U 和 AAMVFCM-U，解决了异构数据模式发现和降维问题，取得显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图聚类方法需要手动调整参数，缺乏基于原则的跨视图整合机制，难以高效处理高维和异构数据特征。

Method: 提出了无参数框架，通过熵正则化实现自适应跨视图一致性，利用信噪比正则化进行特征加权并确保收敛。AAMVFCM-U 进一步结合分层降维机制，分别在特征和视图层面采用自适应阈值进行降维。

Result: 在五种基准测试中，比15种最先进方法表现更优，其中AAMVFCM-U计算效率提高到97%，降维至原始尺寸的0.45%，并自动识别关键视图组合。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多视图聚类中的高维特征和异构性问题，展示了显著的效率和准确性改进，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Hessian矩阵的正则化方法，用于训练可生成模型Probabilistic Circuits (PCs)，以缓解因过拟合导致的泛化性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PC在提高表达能力的同时，由于数据有限，容易导致过拟合，特别是模型收敛于泛化性能较差的“尖锐最优解”。

Method: 通过提出基于Hessian矩阵痕迹正则化的方法，引入梯度范数正则项，用于优化PC的训练，避免收敛于“尖锐最优解”。

Result: 实验表明，新方法引导模型收敛至更平缓的最优解，显著提升了PC的泛化表现。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效结合梯度正则化和二阶信息，为PC训练提供了一种全新的途径，提升了模型的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

TL;DR: 本论文综述视觉-语言模型（VLMs）无监督自适应领域的研究，分类提出四种主要范式，并概述相关核心方法和挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型通常在下游特定场景中的表现欠佳，因此需要进行无监督自适应，以提升实用性并保持数据效率。

Method: 提出基于无标注视觉数据的分类法，将现有方法分为四种范式：无数据传递（Data-Free Transfer）、无监督领域迁移（Unsupervised Domain Transfer）、测试时逐批适应（Episodic Test-Time Adaptation）、在线测试时适应（Online Test-Time Adaptation），并分析各自关键方法和策略。

Result: 创建了一个系统化框架，回顾了代表性基准测试，明确了领域的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 此研究为理解无监督视觉-语言模型自适应提供了全面系统的概述，为进一步研究方向提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

*Qinghua Yao,Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的垂直联邦学习（VFL）框架X-VFL，用于解决非对齐数据样本和部分缺失特征的问题，同时支持每个客户的独立推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的VFL要求所有客户样本完全对齐以及共同协作推理，不支持单一客户的独立推理，这是实际场景中的重大限制。

Method: X-VFL框架设计了两个模块：Cross Completion (XCom)用于通过其他客户的信息完成非对齐样本的特征重建；Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align)则对齐本地与全局特征，支持独立推理。同时，论文证明了训练算法的收敛性。

Result: 在真实数据集上，X-VFL显著优于现有方法，例如在CIFAR-10数据集上准确率提升了15%，在MIMIC-III数据集上提升了43%。

Conclusion: X-VFL在部分缺失特征和本地独立推理的实际场景中表现出显著的效果和优势。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入模型在负采样策略上有限，这影响了模型的训练效率和预测性能。

Method: 在PyKEEN框架扩展中，集成了一套先进的负采样器，包括静态和动态腐蚀策略，生成有意义的负样本，同时支持模块化和兼容性设计。

Result: 实验研究表明，扩展模块对不同嵌入方法的链接预测能力产生积极影响，并提供了优化策略的有益见解。

Conclusion: 通过增强PyKEEN框架的负采样机制，该研究为改进知识图谱嵌入性能和自定义发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

as Random Forest and XGBoost, while offering superior interpretability for

Method: 提出“一毒样本假设”，结合线性回归与分类数学推导，用未涉及数据分布方向的毒化样本注入后门，并通过理论与实验验证假设效果。

Result: 证明了毒化数据在多数情况下对正常任务影响有限，同时反映了使用最低毒化数据量进行后门攻击的可行性。

Conclusion: 在背景知识有限的情况下，即使只采用一个毒化样本，也能够成功注入后门且对模型性能影响较小，为后门攻击提出新威胁。

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，Shuffle-R1框架以极小的开销显著优于现有强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的适配可以显著提升多模态大语言模型的强化学习训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

Method: 提出一个宏观模型，将技术系统与搜索空间的文化演化动态相结合，并通过操控随机性和选择性因素来分析开放式增长的条件。

Conclusion: 开放式技术进化的实现依赖技术系统和搜索空间的相互作用及其在动态平衡中的持续演化。

Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and
cumulatively improve technologies in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness
provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and
to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a
collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from
the interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of
interdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the
aggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting
from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological
systems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By
manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic
or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely
rare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and
search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to
continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas
selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained
production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains
effective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search
space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended
technological evolution.
