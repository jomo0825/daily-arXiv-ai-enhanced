### [1] [OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741)
*Qin Ren,Yifan Wang,Ruogu Fang,Haibin Ling,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OTSurv，一个基于最优传输（OT）理论的新型多实例学习（MIL）框架，用于通过全切片图像（WSIs）进行生存预测，并在六大基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多实例学习方法在应对WSIs的全局形态分布和局部预测不确定性时往往不足，无法充分捕获其病理异质性。

Method: OTSurv通过将生存预测视为带有两种约束的异质性感知OT问题：1）全局长尾约束，通过形态分布来分配传输质量以避免模式崩溃；2）局部不确定性约束，通过提升高置信度区域的优先级来抑制噪声。最终，采用高效的矩阵缩放算法解决非均衡OT问题。

Result: OTSurv在六个热门基准测试中实现了绝对3.6%的C指数提升，并在统计学检验中取得显著意义，同时兼具高解释性。

Conclusion: OTSurv是一种通过最优传输理论解决WSIs生存预测问题的有效工具，对病理学的数字化分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a
multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often
fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both
globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally
through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a
principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal
distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel
MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv
formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two
constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological
distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by
regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware
constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by
progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT
problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that
can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.
Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular
benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In
addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers
high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in
digital pathology. Our codes are available at

### [2] [StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20756)
*Haodong Li,Chen Wang,Jiahui Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StereoDiff，一种结合立体匹配和视频深度扩散的双阶段视频深度估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频深度估计中动态与静态区域的不一致性问题。

Method: 在静态区域利用立体匹配方法获取全局3D信息，在动态区域利用大规模视频深度数据进行训练以确保平滑过渡。

Result: 实验表明StereoDiff在零样本、真实动态视频深度基准测试中表现出色，无论是室内还是室外环境都达到了SoTA性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了立体匹配和视频深度扩散的互补优势，有效提升了视频深度估计中的一致性和精度。

Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following
the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained
video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth
estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal
consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are
fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically
backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all
frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for
dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to
ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.
Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth
estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with
video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic
areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth
diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,
highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of
both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth
benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance,
showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

### [3] [ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757)
*Zhiyuan Wu,Yongqiang Zhao,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了ConViTac，通过对比嵌入条件机制（CEC）显著提升了视觉与触觉的特征融合效果，提高了下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉和触觉是机器人感知的两大关键模态，如何更好整合这两种感知信息以增强任务性能是一个主要研究动机。

Method: 提出了ConViTac网络，利用对比编码器将视觉与触觉输入投射到统一的潜在嵌入空间，并使用跨模态注意机制对特征进行融合对齐。

Result: ConViTac在真实世界实验中优于现有方法，CEC机制在材料分类和抓取预测任务中提升了精度高达12.0%。

Conclusion: 对比嵌入条件（CEC）显著提高了视觉和触觉感知的联合作用，为机器人感知任务提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering
complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks.
Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations
to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on
direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality
fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we
propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to
enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive
representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning
(CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through
self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into
unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile
feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified
representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world
over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC
mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification
and grasping prediction tasks.

### [4] [AI-Driven MRI-based Brain Tumour Segmentation Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20786)
*Connor Ludwig,Khashayar Namdar,Farzad Khalvati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了一系列模型用于医学图像分割，且比较了不同提示质量下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对各种提示质量下的多种医学分割模型表现的综合评估。

Method: 使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）、SAM 2、MedSAM、SAM-Med-3D和nnU-Net在BraTS 2023数据集上进行零样本推理，并评估提示点和边界框的性能。此外，对部分模型进行数据集微调以评估改进效果。

Result: 在高度准确的边界框提示下，SAM和SAM 2的Dice分数优于nnU-Net，但高质量提示的提供不现实。nnU-Net总体上仍表现最佳，微调后点提示性能有所提升，但未超越边界框或nnU-Net。

Conclusion: nnU-Net依旧是医学图像分割的主导模型；然而，提示模型的微调改进为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net
based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There
have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced
in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of
these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset.
This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM
2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS
2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for
both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice
scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893,
respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds
nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant
medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing
highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well
as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and
SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt
performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future
investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding
boxes or nnU-Net.

### [5] [How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795)
*Stephanie Käs,Anton Burenko,Louis Markert,Onur Alp Culha,Dennis Mack,Timm Linder,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探索了通过视觉基础模型(VFMs)和视觉语言模型(VLMs)替代传统任务专用架构，用于动态全身手势识别，并引入了适用于人机交流的NUGGET数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的手势识别通常依赖特定任务的架构，但这些方法较为复杂且缺乏通用性，因此研究尝试利用VFMs和VLMs降低系统复杂性。

Method: 引入NUGGET数据集，并比较了V-JEPA、Gemini Flash 2.0和HD-GCN这三种手势识别方法在动态全身手势识别中的表现。

Result: HD-GCN表现最佳，V-JEPA通过简单的任务专用分类头次之，而Gemini在零样本情况下表现不佳，说明输入表示需进一步研究。

Conclusion: HD-GCN仍是当前最佳选择，但V-JEPA展示了其作为多任务共享模型潜力，并证明了通过VFMs减少系统复杂性的可能性。

Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy
environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture
recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or
skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs)
and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities
offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated
task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for
dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art
VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing
skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for
human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the
different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves
best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific
classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system
complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini
struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the
zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input
representations for gestures.

### [6] [Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832)
*Cansu Korkmaz,Ahmet Murat Tekalp,Zafer Dogan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型和视觉-语言模型（VLM）的超分辨率图像选择框架，以选择最具信任的图像输出，采用新定义的信任分数（TWS）评价图片的可依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的回归和扩散模型在如何生成可信的超分辨率图像存在局限性，尤其是在精目信息应用中（如数字或字母识别）。

Method: 利用扩散模型生成多样性超分辨率图像集合，并引入VLM（如BLIP-2和GPT-4）对图像进行评估，通过语义正确性、视觉质量和伪影评估选择可信样本，将其合成得到最终输出。提出新型混合指标TWS，以CLIP嵌入、SSIM边缘图及多层小波分解评估图像的可信度。

Result: 实验表明提出的方法能更强地与人类偏好相关；VLM选择的图像样本在TWS评分中具有领先表现，同时优于PSNR及LPIPS等传统指标。

Conclusion: 方法以原则性、可扩展性和普适性的方式，解决了扩散超分辨率中的不确定性问题，为生成式超分辨率领域的可信度树立了新标杆。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible
solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive
SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single
solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity
in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On
the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but
selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This
paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most
trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic
reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs
such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries
to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The
top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy
output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of
VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid
metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:
semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on
edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.
We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both
ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield
high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail
to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,
and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR
space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,
this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

### [7] [FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841)
*Ha Min Son,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FixCLR的方法，改进半监督领域泛化问题，尤其适用少量标签场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSDG方法在标签稀缺时表现不佳，未能显式实现跨域不变性表示学习。

Method: 通过借鉴对比学习，利用伪标签类信息，并仅使用排斥项以强化领域不变性，提出FixCLR方法。

Result: FixCLR验证了其在不同实验设置中表现优越，并能与其他方法结合提升性能，尤其适用于多领域数据。

Conclusion: FixCLR是一种有效的SSDG方法，在标签有限情况下能改进泛化性能，且兼容性强，可与现有方法协同使用。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of
generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available.
Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often
underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised
learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do
not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all
domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we
introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change
two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain
invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels
and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most
existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance
improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been
previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking
different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance
of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many
domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when
combined with other semi-supervised methods.

### [8] [Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850)
*Yuting He,Shuo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了向量对比学习（vector CL）框架COVER，用于解决在医学视觉领域中扩展到像素级表示的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析，标准的对比学习存在过度追求特征离散性的问题，导致像素级特征分布被破坏。因此，需要新的方法解决这一挑战，特别是在医学视觉中的像素级预训练任务。

Method: 提出了COVER框架，通过将对比学习重构为向量回归问题，量化像素级预训练中的离散性，并使用向量金字塔架构实现不同粒度的特征匹配。

Result: COVER在2D和4种模式下的8项任务中都表现出显著改进，表明其有助于提升像素级自监督学习能力。

Conclusion: COVER框架可以保持像素级特征相关性，在医学视觉领域推进了更全面和泛化的视觉基础模型开发。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised
pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise
representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard
CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the
excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,
breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class
distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,
enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling
feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel
paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER
establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent
optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a
vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving
pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks,
spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves
pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.

### [9] [Enhancing Ambiguous Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with Soft Label-based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20867)
*Ryosuke Kawamura,Hideaki Hayashi,Shunsuke Otake,Noriko Takemura,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为MIDAS的数据增强方法，用于提升动态面部表情识别(DFER)中对模糊表情数据的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DFER模型在面对真实场景中的模糊表情数据时存在识别准确率的瓶颈，因此需要一种针对性的增强方法来提高性能。

Method: 通过引入软标签来表示多种情感类别的概率分布，并使用帧对帧混合的方式扩展Mixup方法，从而提高对视频数据中表情模糊性的处理能力。

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k-Plus数据集上的实验表明，使用MIDAS增强数据训练的模型在性能上优于使用原始数据训练的现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS方法通过针对模糊表情引入软标签和数据混合策略，显著提高了DFER任务的表现。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates
emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications,
accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered
in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data
augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial
expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple
emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of
video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach
extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly
effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we
conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly
constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The
results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve
superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the
original dataset.

### [10] [THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877)
*Calin Teodor Ioan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ThirdEye的方法，通过专门的预训练网络来提供单目深度估计所需的明确线索，不再依赖传统的隐式学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目深度估计模型直接从RGB像素推断深度，但忽略了诸如遮挡、阴影和透视等人类视觉系统的明确线索，因此需要一种系统性的方法来引入这些线索。

Method: 设计了一个三阶段皮层层次结构(V1-V2-V3)，通过专门的预训练冻结网络提供明确线索，并通过加权机制整合线索，最终通过自适应分箱变换头生成高分辨率视差图。

Result: 本研究尚未给出定量结果，预计将在未来修订中提供。

Conclusion: ThirdEye方法通过整合外部监督和线索模块，提升了整体单目深度估计的线索依赖性，仅需较少微调即可实现高效估计。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer
depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit
monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion
boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to
discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that
deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen
networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1->V2->V3)
equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by
reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution
disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large
amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This
extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific
motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will
appear in a future revision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为MultiHuman-Testbench的基准，用于评估多人物图像生成方法的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多人物图像生成中缺乏专用基准的问题，尤其是对复杂动作和保留面部身份特征的生成场景。

Method: 设计了一套名为MultiHuman-Testbench的新基准，包括1800个样本，结合多样化文本提示和5,550张唯一人脸图像。基准提供了多元化的评估指标，并提出了利用人类分割及图像区域隔离的新技术来改善身份相似性。

Result: 对多种生成模型进行了全面评估，验证了基准的有效性，并提出的改进方法显著提高了面部身份相似性。

Conclusion: 该基准与新发现不仅深化了多人物图像生成研究，还为后续研究提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions,
while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major
factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address
this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously
evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark
comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a
range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a
total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity
across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide
human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We
propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify
face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a
thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches
and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose
novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human
segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our
proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a
standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Conclusion: 结合几何和学习特征的内在抽象能够更好地理解和改进立体视觉系统。

Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision
systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception
contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model
and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth
discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature
matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of
attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both
theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate
that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal
abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.

### [13] [FaSTA$^*$: Fast-Slow Toolpath Agent with Subroutine Mining for Efficient Multi-turn Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20911)
*Advait Gupta,Rishie Raj,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为FaSTA*的高效神经符号代理，用于多轮图像编辑任务，通过结合LLM的快速高层规划和A*搜索的精确低层工具使用，显著提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多轮图像编辑任务的问题，同时降低计算成本。

Method: 通过大语言模型（LLM）进行快速高层规划，并结合A*搜索进行精确工具使用，还通过提取和重用成功案例中的子程序以减少探索成本，形成适应性的快慢规划架构。

Result: 证明FaSTA*在计算效率上显著超越现有方法，同时在成功率上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: FaSTA*结合了高效规划和低层探索，提出了一种具有可扩展性的图像编辑解决方案，既降低了成本，又提高了效率。

Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging
multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while
recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the
wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large
language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$
search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to
AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive
reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously
extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for
future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level
subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$
search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save
exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,
yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask
planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted
by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$
search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with
recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more
computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art
baseline in terms of success rate.

*Ju-Hyeon Nam,Dong-Hyun Moon,Sang-Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了M2SFormer，一个基于Transformer编码器的框架，用于更高效且准确地定位图片伪造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决当前深度学习方法在图片精细伪造定位上的表示能力受限及计算开销大的问题。

Method: 框架通过结合多频率和多尺度注意力机制，使用全局先验图与难度引导的注意力模块来提高伪造定位的效率。此外，减少了上采样中细节损失。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，相比现有技术提升了伪造检测与定位的性能并具备较强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M2SFormer大幅优化了数字图片伪造定位的准确性与效率，为未来相关技术方向提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative
use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based
methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery
localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and
limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In
this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework
designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial
and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and
multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to
better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses
the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a
curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then
guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations
more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models,
offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across
unseen domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PhysRig，一个基于物理的可微骨架绑定框架，用以克服现有线性混合绑定（LBS）的局限性，比如体积丢失及不自然变形，尤其在处理软组织和弹性材料时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LBS方法因简单和可微特性被广泛使用，但其在建模弹性材料（如软组织、毛发、灵活的肢体）时表现不佳，且会导致体积损失和不自然变形。

Method: 提出PhysRig框架，将刚性骨架嵌入体积表示（如四面体网格）中，模拟为由动画骨架驱动的软体结构。框架利用连续力学和欧拉背景网格中的粒子离散技术，同时引入材料原型以减少学习空间而保持高表达力。

Result: 在综合数据集（来自Objaverse、The Amazing Animals Zoo、MixaMo）上测试，PhysRig在生成真实、物理合理的变形上优于传统LBS方法。

Conclusion: PhysRig不仅产生更自然的变形效果，还表现出在姿态迁移任务中的多样性，证明了其在关节物体建模上的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated
object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and
differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and
unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft
tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty
tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based
skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding
the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),
which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated
skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object
as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure
differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.
Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the
learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our
framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from
Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object
categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional
LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the
pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object
modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了层次子动作树 (HST-CSLR) 以更高效地结合手语文本知识与视觉特征，解决数据集和标注不足的问题，并在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有CSLR数据集和精确标注不足，导致训练数据匮乏的问题亟需解决。当前方法未能充分利用文本知识，因此需要一种更有效的跨模态对齐方法。

Method: 通过引入从大语言模型中获得的文本知识，提出了一种层次子动作树 (HST-CSLR)，以逐步对齐视觉和文本模态。同时，设计了对比对齐增强机制以进一步增强跨模态对齐效果。

Result: HST-CSLR方法在四个数据集(PHOENIX-2014、PHOENIX-2014T、CSL-Daily和Sign Language Gesture)上表现出色，验证了其效果。

Conclusion: 通过结合层次树结构和对比对齐技术，HST-CSLR有效解决了CSLR中的数据匮乏和跨模态对齐问题，可显著提升手语识别性能。

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed
videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate
that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck
for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have
developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities.
However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully
utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge
with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge
from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more
effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information
representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and
benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.
Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap
between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014,
PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.

Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide
imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based
computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models
primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language
instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including
insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image
understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To
address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically
designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,
pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer
turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated
that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as
both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific
models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI
system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide
images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching
high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis
benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,

TL;DR: 本文提出DFVEdit，一种零样本视频编辑方法，可以高效应用于Video DiTs进行视频生成，不需要注释修改或微调，提升生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频编辑方法在应用于Video DiTs时通常成本高，需要改进注意力机制或进行微调。为了优化效率和解决此问题，提出DFVEdit方法。

Method: 通过连续流动角度统一编辑和采样，提出无偏估计的条件差流向量(CDFV)，并整合隐式交叉注意力(ICA)指导和嵌入强化(ER)来优化编辑质量。不需要改动注意力机制或微调，直接对干净的潜变量进行操作。

Result: DFVEdit提供至少20倍推理速度提升和85%内存减少，在常用Video DiTs（如CogVideoX和Wan2.1）上均达到了结构保真度、时空一致性和编辑质量的行业最佳性能。

Conclusion: DFVEdit显著提高了Video DiTs的视频编辑效率和效果，为高效视频生成提供了一种创新的方法。

Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in
video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to
Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to
resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this
problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method
tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention
modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow
transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can
be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this
foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a
theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross
Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further
enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at
least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared
to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to
popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art
performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing
quality.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Cradle2Cane的双阶段面部老化框架，基于文本到图像扩散模型，解决年龄与身份一致性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部老化方法在处理大年龄差距或极端头部姿态时难以实现逼真的转变，同时难以平衡年龄准确性与身份一致性（Age-ID权衡）。

Method: 提出Cradle2Cane框架，采用两阶段模型：第一阶段通过自适应噪声注入机制（AdaNI）聚焦于年龄准确性，第二阶段通过基于身份感知嵌入（SVR-ArcFace和Rotate-CLIP）的去噪增强身份一致性。

Result: 通过CelebA-HQ数据集实验，采用Face++和Qwen-VL评估协议，Cradle2Cane在年龄准确性和身份一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Cradle2Cane框架有效解决了面部老化中的年龄准确性与身份一致性问题，是一种先进的面部老化解决方案。

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications
ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle
with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire
lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The
core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what
we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age
transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this
work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named
Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first
pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection
(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of
age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by
adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing
more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is
weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second
pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features
by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace
and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the
first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the
aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive
experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL
protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in
age accuracy and identity consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合相机光度优化的创新3D场景相机表示方法，有助于提升多视图图像下3D场景表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图场景表示受到相机成像中光度失真的影响，可能引入与场景无关的错误信息，致使表示质量下降。

Method: 通过引入内部与外部光度模型，本文提出了完整的光度模型及相应的相机表示方法。与此同时，利用光度参数优化结合深度正则化的方式，有效分离与场景无关的信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，在成像退化情况下（如渐晕、尘污），该方法依然能够构建高质量的3D场景表示。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能够优化光度参数，同时能够同时表示场景辐射场和相机光度模型，从而提升成像退化条件下的表示精度。

Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer
vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions
in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without
accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently
incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the
quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D
scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By
introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full
photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on
simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the
proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D
scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric
parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene
representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the
camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a
complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera
photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of
imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.

Motivation: 现有稠密信号图像生成方法遇到编辑困难及与文本提示不一致问题，因此重新探索稀疏信号的简单性和形状无关特性。

Method: 提出了一种空间姿态控制网络SP-Ctrl，将OpenPose扩展为可学习的空间表示，并通过关键点嵌入学习和概念学习提升姿态对齐。

Result: 实验结果显示，SP-Ctrl在稀疏姿态引导生成中优于现行方法，并与稠密信号的方法表现相当，同时具备跨物种生成能力。

Conclusion: SP-Ctrl实现了稀疏信号在姿态指导图像生成中的卓越表现，突出了其简单性、多样性和潜力。

Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an
alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial
guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense
representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and
potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to
revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and
shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust
controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend
OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings
discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept
learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions
of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and
human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose
guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods.
Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species
generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CZSL方法在处理语义子集划分和组合差异性时存在局限性，影响了图像与组合的精细对齐能力。

Method: 提出了EVA框架，包括领域专家匹配和语义变体对齐，通过多专家实现高质量表示学习和语义相关的图像-原语匹配。

Result: EVA在三个主流基准上均显著优于现有最先进方法，无论是封闭世界还是开放世界设定。

Conclusion: EVA框架有效改进了CZSL的表现，突出了提出方法的实用性和创新性。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional
generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on
learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives
features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal
for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets.
Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional
divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained
image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a
Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically,
we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve
token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To
enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic
variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for
image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and
open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for
analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to
limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these
limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation
foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce
PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology
segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label
triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform
semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for
laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher
accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture.
It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145
and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in
segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover,
PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models
through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering
pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work
advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.

TL;DR: 提出TSDASeg，一个两阶段模型，通过直接跨模态对齐模块（Direct cross-modal Alignment）和记忆模块协同工作，解决了3D点云与文本/图像直接对齐不足的问题，从而提升交互式点云分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D视觉语言模型在点级任务（如分割）性能不足，主要原因是缺乏直接的3D-文本对齐。这限制了本地3D特征与语境的连接能力，从而在实际交互场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: TSDASeg有效解决了3D点云与文本对齐不足的问题，通过动态记忆与直接对齐的结合，在多场景交互式分割任务中表现卓越，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred
significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly
for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in
point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text
alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual
context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled
with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive
point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module
to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image
data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to
separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal
correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through
self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features
based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in
interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments
conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法对单一视频生成了多种语义上相异的音轨，其总合成音频的质量优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高质量的分层视频到音频生成，为相关生成任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that
sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific
sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows,
aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively.
Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task,
conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This
design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional
generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a
training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and
eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more
accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading
to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有视图合成方法对高分辨率图像和静态几何假设依赖较大，在动态场景中表现不佳，因此需要开发一种能处理动态模糊场景的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为DBMovi-GS的方法，通过稀疏高斯点云生成和动态模糊视频中的清晰场景重建，实现动态视图合成。

Result: 在动态模糊场景下表现出较高的鲁棒性，并达到了新的基准性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实场景中的动态视图合成表现优越，特别是在模糊视频输入的情况下，显著提升了视觉保真度和稳定性。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives;
however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an
unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel
view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on
high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid
scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world
environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and
degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View
Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting
(DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular
videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry
videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic
motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view
synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic
novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data
distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to
training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly.
This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that
composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the
effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training,
SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based
on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction
to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and
pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model
to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and
robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby
improving overall detection performance. The comprehensive quality evaluation
further confirms the generalizability and practicality of SAIC in clinical
application scenarios. Our code will be released at

TL;DR: 研究反向场景文字移除（ISTR），主要关注于分类识别和定位被移除的文字区域，同时尝试恢复文字，发现具有高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最初为了隐藏隐私或移除不需要的文字，但随着技术发展，误用风险增加，因此研究如何检测并逆向分析被处理的图像。

Method: 提出一种围绕二分类（识别图像是否经历过STR处理）和定位移除文字区域的技术，并尝试通过文字识别器恢复被移内容。

Result: 实验表明，二分类识别和定位任务可以高精度完成，提示这一方法能有效检测潜在误用并改善STR技术。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过ISTR技术能够有效检测场景文字移除的操作并定位移除区域，同时尝试恢复内容展现这一任务的难度。

Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was
originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from
natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR
typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced
through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This
paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images
andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone
STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that
these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of
potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed
text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.

TL;DR: 提出了名为VisionGuard的多阶段框架，通过改进分类一致性和提高对不平衡数据的召回率，改善了头盔违规的自动检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于环境多变、摄像头角度和数据不一致导致的头盔违规自动检测困难问题，提高检测的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 提出了VisionGuard框架，包括两个主要模块：Adaptive Labeling模块通过跟踪算法增强分类一致性；Contextual Expander模块通过生成虚拟边界框改善不平衡数据的召回率。

Result: 实验结果表明，VisionGuard相比基线检测器总体mAP提升了3.1%。

Conclusion: VisionGuard框架在交通监控系统中具有有效性和现实部署潜力，有助于促进安全与规范的遵守。

Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing
road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems.
However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges
due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the
data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and
disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome
the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class
imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key
components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive
Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances
classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign
persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual
Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating
virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively
addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that
VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors,
demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in
traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory
compliance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SAM和FFCL的深度学习框架，用于改进乳腺肿瘤边界检测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前使用的2D标本放射检查方法在术中评估乳腺癌边界状态的准确性有限，导致近四分之一的患者需要再次手术。

Method: 开发了一种结合Segment Anything Model (SAM)和Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL)的深度学习框架，利用ResNet-18骨干进行预训练，然后通过粗略二值掩膜重建精细肿瘤边界分割。

Result: 框架的边界分类AUC达到0.8455，分割性能较基线模型提高了27.4%的Dice相似性，每张图像推断时间缩短至47毫秒。

Conclusion: FFCL-SAM框架显著改进了术中乳腺肿瘤边界评估的速度和准确性，有望减少患者的再手术率并提升手术结果。

Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during
lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D
specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative
specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of
patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep
learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with
Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging
both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR
images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,
non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18
backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary
masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach
achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with
a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing
inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that
FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative
margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and
improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Aging Multiverse的框架，可通过单张图片生成多种可能的面部衰老轨迹，并依赖外部因素（如环境、健康、生活方式）进行控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的面部衰老建模方法将衰老视为单一的确定路径，难以捕捉复杂的潜在变化及与外部因素的关联。

Method: 通过无训练的扩散模型，实现身份保持、年龄精准及条件控制之间的平衡；引入注意力混合机制调整编辑强度，并使用模拟衰老正则化策略稳定编辑效果。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在身份表现、衰老写实性及条件一致性方面超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将衰老过程转变为多维可控且可解释的过程，该框架为数字叙事、健康教育及个性化可视化等领域提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple
plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on
external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior
methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates
an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a
training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age
accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing
to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to
stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and
conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression
models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By
transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable
process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital
storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种增强现实（AR）系统，用于可视化需要插入新视图的错误，并减少数据采集任务的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要用户在AR中对齐显示以完成数据采集任务，这既费力又限制了场景探索，论文旨在简化这一过程并扩大探索范围。

Method: 通过使用局部重建的光场并可视化需移除的错误来引导新视图插入，从而优化移动视图合成系统的数据采集和处理。

Result: 实验表明，这种错误高峰可视化方法更直观，减少了对最终结果的失望感，同时在采样较少的情况下仍能达到满意效果。

Conclusion: 新方法能显著提升用户体验，并为大场景的辐射场重建（如3D高斯点云）提供支持。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for
novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view
samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data
collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to
pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling
theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we
propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be
removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking
visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is
satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We
also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field
reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.

*Qizhi Xie,Kun Yuan,Yunpeng Qu,Jiachao Gong,Mingda Wu,Ming Sun,Chao Zhou,Jihong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过引入基于得分的指令生成管道（SIG）来改进视频质量评估（VQA），并提出了一个大型数据集S2I，同时设立了一个新的基准S2I-Bench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法通过数值评分评估视频质量，但存在无法解读复杂质量维度的问题。为了弥补这一不足，该研究探索利用基于指令调优的视频多模态大模型（LMMs）。

Method: 提出一个名为SIG的自动化管道，通过对未标注视频的质量维度进行评分并映射到文本定义的级别，结合层次化的逻辑链建模质量关联性，自动生成大量质量指令数据集（S2I）。同时设计逐步调优策略来提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，使用S2I数据集调优后的模型，在S2I-Bench和其他现有基准上的质量评分和解释能力均显著提高。

Conclusion: SIG方法能有效扩展高质量训练数据的生成规模，其提出的S2I数据集和S2I-Bench基准为提升和评估视频LMM的能力奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score
to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to
describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.
Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models
(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.
The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.
Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data
generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary
systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.
Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled
video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a
hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific
dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning
process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written
quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and
generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset
contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for
instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and
justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy
to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a
benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the
quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the
S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently
improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video
LMMs.

Conclusion: FedSC为联邦学习提供了一种基于语义信息的新方案，有效解决了数据异质性问题，并在实验中证明了其稳定性与效果。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients
without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is
the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences
at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data
heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,
fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information
contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client
semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this
paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)
to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous
clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and
consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class
underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise
collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive
learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational
prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other
hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,
as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local
model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a
convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Conclusion: 提出的方法表明随着量子硬件的发展，量子图像生成具有广阔的应用前景，可在医疗领域助力数据不足问题的解决。

Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease
detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality
data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy
concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical
generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational
resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield
grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space
fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first
classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating
color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs
and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and
classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the
performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art
classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10
times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for
quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate
the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware
noise.

Conclusion: MPA-FER提供了精确且可解释的表征，在细粒度面部表情识别中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language
models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,
current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to
capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for
distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this
challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called
MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process
of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable
representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt
generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to
generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based
external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature
discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the
generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach
incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the
prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with
class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local
alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further
improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained
model and minimizing computational costs.

Conclusion: LASFNet能够在显著降低计算资源消耗的同时实现高效的多模态目标检测，其代码将开源以供验证和进一步研究。

Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for
multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex
training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking
multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational
overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline
that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance
detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we
propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network
(LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature
fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features
at both global and local levels based on attention information from different
modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation.
Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is
designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and
minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative
datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach
achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of
parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively,
while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be

Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational
demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the
efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent
advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by
eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance
compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents.
By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using
traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution
details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our
knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive
performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128
discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold
reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary
latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked
improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models
allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X
GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve
competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any
in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.

Conclusion: DidSee框架通过改进偏差消减机制与语义增强，成功解决了非朗伯区域深度修复的难题，达到了优秀的精度和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for
non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to
generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent
advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models
to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that
biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion
framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the
lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders
precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a
diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects.
First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal
signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a
noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation
caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss.
Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion
and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding
precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance
on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and
effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation
and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/

Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between
training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to
domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with
large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of
diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting
intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature
collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing
performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an
object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class
prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.
We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,
balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving
performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a
unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through
feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and
unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection
performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on
3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO
generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant
advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data
scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to
domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights
for visual perception tasks across diverse domains. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像编辑中保真性和编辑性之间的权衡问题，增强保真性的同时最小限度影响编辑性。

Method: 提议了Faithfulness Guidance（保真度引导）以强化输入图像信息的保留，同时设计了一个调度策略解决保真性和编辑性之间的不对齐问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，FGS在保持编辑性的同时，显著提高了保真性，并且适配多种编辑方法，可实现高质量图像编辑。

Conclusion: FGS是一种高效的方法，能够在多种任务中达到精确、高质量的图像编辑，增强了保真性和编辑性的平衡。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image
synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial
aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and
faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved.
However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent
trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose
Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with
minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to
strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a
scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and
faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior
faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with
various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across
diverse tasks.

Motivation: 传统对抗性样本攻击依赖监督学习特征，迁移效能有限。本文探索自监督ViT的全局与局部特征的潜力，提升对抗性迁移能力。

Method: 提出一种生成式双自监督ViT特征攻击（dSVA），结合对比学习 (CL) 和遮掩图像建模 (MIM) 特征，通过生成器训练框架结合ViT注意力机制生成对抗性样本。

Result: 实验发现CL和MIM特征互补，联合利用能显著提升对抗样本在不同深度模型架构中的迁移效果，并超越现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 自监督ViT提取的多样特征可显著增强对抗性样本的黑盒迁移能力，验证了联合特征破坏的有效性。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and
interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate
features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial
perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box
transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in
previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised
learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether
exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve
adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual
self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural
features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked
image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We
design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to
create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by
exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs.
Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature
tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial
generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised
ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of
various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档分析方法仅适用于固定类别定义，缺乏用户自定义的灵活性，因此提出灵活支持多粒度和开放集合应用的匹配任务。

Method: 开发了一个新的数据集RoI-Matching-Bench，提出了基于双网络的RoI-Matcher框架，利用跨注意力层整合和对齐不同域中的相似语义。

Result: 在RoI-Matching-Bench上验证了该方法的有效性，并作为后续研究的基准方法。

Conclusion: RoI-Matcher在灵活高效的文档自定义分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to
their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions,
such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only
suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve
flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new
task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for
short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient,
multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference
document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is
the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the
above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets
three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the
macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new
framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level
features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers
to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show
that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and
serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决从掩膜2D图像和自然语言描述中检索室内复杂场景中的3D目标的挑战。

Method: 基于CLIP的语义匹配与基于二值轮廓的形状引导排名相结合，并采用多数投票策略，配合专用的预处理流程提高掩膜质量。

Result: 在ROOMELSA测试集上取得了具有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 形状先验与语言理解的结合对于鲁棒的开放世界3D目标检索至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D
image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The
ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating
reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges
are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous
language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose
SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI
integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived
from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting
strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by
extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our
hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving
competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results
highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding
for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像的3D角色建模方法在姿态标准化阶段会因遮挡和视角问题产生失真影像，影响后续3D重建的几何质量。

Method: PoseMaster采用了基于流的3D原生生成框架，将姿态转换和角色生成统一，同时利用3D角色骨架中的骨骼作为姿态控制条件，并通过随机清空训练条件提高模型的通用性。还建立了高质量的数据集，用于学习骨架与蒙皮权重间隐式关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，PoseMaster在A姿态角色生成的质量和多姿态精准控制方面全面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PoseMaster有效解决了传统方法的失真问题，实现了对3D角色任意姿态的高精度生成，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the
efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two
separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the
A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and
degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and
viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent
reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an
end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we
unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D
native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we
propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable
character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of
multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image
condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of
pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived
from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit
relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show
that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while
demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary
poses.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to
deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical
capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the
challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain
largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing
multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and
shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model
misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut
problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,
directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.
To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with
a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This
global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking
key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the
accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a
context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy
rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the
LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process
successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also
introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating
models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed
method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks
compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前深度学习的立体匹配模型在追求高准确度的同时实现实时性仍具挑战，而成本体积既需要高效处理，又需确保信息完整性。

Method: 提出增强型Shuffle Mixer（ESM），结合初始视差估计特征与图像特征，使用混洗和分层处理，再通过Hourglass网络实现特征精炼。

Result: 紧凑版ESMStereo在高端GPU和AGX Orin硬件上分别实现了116 FPS和91 FPS的推理速度。

Conclusion: ESM可在保证实时性能的同时，通过优化小成本体积结构恢复详细场景几何，具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern
autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that
deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major
challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo
matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost
volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information
and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and
regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale
cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising
route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure
highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the
Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with
small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary
features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from
the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These
features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a
compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene
geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large
receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a
highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo
achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX
Orin.

Motivation: 由于现有数据集缺乏多镜头场景的标注，导致VideoLLMs在此类场景中表现不佳，因此需要新数据集和改进模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了新的数据集MultiClip-Bench，包含密集描述和基于指令的问题解答对，并引入了IPFormer-VideoLLM模型，通过高效的基于注意力的连接器注入实例级特征提示，提高多场景信息聚合能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，新数据集显著提升了多镜头场景的性能，提出的模型在多视频基准上也表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: MultiClip-Bench数据集和IPFormer-VideoLLM模型共同改善了多场景视频理解能力，并为有效评估该能力提供了可靠的基准。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot
scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This
challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key
frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of
multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new
dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and
instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios.
We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot
performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the
model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering
that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy
manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new
model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level
features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector.
This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance
the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct
advantages across various video benchmarks.

Conclusion: OracleFusion框架在未见过的甲骨文字符解读上表现出类专家水平，为促进甲骨文解读提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS)
encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient
civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters,
only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with
their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for
interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first
stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with
enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of
the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the
second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF),
incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to
ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This
approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering
visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that
OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of
semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both
readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides
expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for
advancing the decipherment of OBS.

Conclusion: FlickCD以更低的资源开销实现了接近甚至超越当前SOTA模型的性能，展示了轻量级模型在实际应用中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,
disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and
large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep
learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and
computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into
significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study
explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that
maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an
essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose
FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries
of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced
Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between
temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and
weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change
decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion
Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global
Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple
scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and
storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1)
accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over
time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI.
As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to
maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational
overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats,
which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from
sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module
that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused,
local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats
supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal
segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved
reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust
foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in
autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying
multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on
supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor
equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor
to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless
integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward
distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple
plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a
hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to
enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost
prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &
nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior

TL;DR: 提出了HalluSegBench，用于评估视觉-语言分割模型中的幻想（hallucinations），特别是通过反事实的视觉推理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言分割模型易出现幻觉性失误，如生成不符合图像内容的分割掩膜或错误标注与图像无关的区域，而现有评估方法不足以全面诊断这些问题。

Method: 提出了HalluSegBench，一个基于反事实视觉推理的评估基准，包含1340对反事实实例数据集和新的评估指标，用于量化模型在视觉一致的场景编辑下的幻想敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，视觉驱动的幻想比标签驱动的更加普遍，现有模型经常在错误分割中表现顽固性。

Conclusion: 反事实推理是评估模型着陆真实性的关键，HalluSegBench为此提供了新的基准和洞见。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced
grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit
hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the
image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing
evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or
textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their
capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce
HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual
reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual
instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly
introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually
coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art
vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations
are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often
persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual
reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image
enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the
environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due
to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a
paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated
extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1
lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB
references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named
See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement
approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages
the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to
restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which
an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss
are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration.
Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available

Motivation: 精准的心肌瘢痕分割对于临床评估和治疗计划至关重要，但存在标注噪声、数据异质性和类别不平衡等挑战。

Method: 通过微调最先进的模型构建深度学习管道，结合Kullback-Leibler损失和数据增强技术，同时应对标注噪声等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化心肌瘢痕量化奠定了可靠基础，并支持深度学习在心脏影像学的广泛临床应用。

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential
for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a
robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and
segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly
addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data
heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and
extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute
and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth
segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an
out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various
imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable
foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader
clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了YOLO-FDA，一种基于YOLO的新型检测框架，以解决工业场景中表面缺陷检测中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业场景中的表面缺陷具有多样性和复杂性，现有方法在检测的细节敏感性、冗余特性和多尺度稳健性方面表现不足。

Method: 该方法利用YOLOv5骨干网络，并引入BiFPN架构、DDFM模块以及注意力驱动的特征融合策略（AC和CAF）。

Result: 实验表明，YOLO-FDA在多种缺陷类型和尺度下均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-FDA提供了一种高效且稳健的表面缺陷检测解决方案，适用于多样化工业场景。

Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and
technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular
shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures.
Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance,
existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail
sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these
challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that
integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion.
Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional
multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture
fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM)
that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer
to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level
features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel
attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and
Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and
reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and
scales.

Motivation: 解决现有生物医学分割任务中忽视标签间语义关系的问题，提高高光谱成像数据分割的精度与效用。

Method: 提出两种基于树状语义的损失函数，结合稀疏背景无注释的训练方法，优化分割任务的标签语义利用效率。

Result: 方法在包含107类且组织为临床语义树结构的高光谱成像数据集中表现优异，达到了最先进性能，且能有效检测分布外像素而不影响分布内像素的分割表现。

Conclusion: 结合树状语义损失函数与稀疏注释训练，可显著提升高光谱成像分割性能，并增强分布外像素检测能力，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications,
offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the
naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision
systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However,
commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all
errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the
label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions
which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further
incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with
sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated
HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic
tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance
on in-distribution (ID) pixels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Video-X^2L的方法，通过双层KV压缩和选择性KV重新加载，实现了对长视频的高效理解，显著降低计算成本且不损失关键信息的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频理解（LVU）中面临高计算成本的瓶颈，尽管KV压缩技术有所应用，但在高压缩比下往往导致信息丢失严重，因此需要一种兼顾信息保留与计算效率的方法。

Method: 提出了两项关键操作：1）双层KV压缩，在预填充阶段生成低压缩捕捉细节信息的L-KVs和高压缩提供简洁表示的H-KVs；2）选择性KV重新加载，在解码阶段对关键信息段使用L-KVs，其他部分使用H-KVs，从而兼顾信息保留与模型效率。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU、LongVideoBench和VNBench等多个流行的LVU基准测试上，Video-X^2L相比现有的KV压缩方法在性能上有显著提升，同时计算成本大幅下降。

Conclusion: Video-X^2L方法无需额外训练，能够直接兼容现有的KV可压缩MLLMs，为长视频理解提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，将极大推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive
computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate
this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high
compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly
preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two
key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the
MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:
low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and
high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second
one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,
Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while
using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully
utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.
Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and
directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L
with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L
outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while
substantially saving the computation cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BitMark的比特级水印框架，用于文本到图像生成模型Infinity，以应对生成内容被用作训练数据可能导致的模型折叠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型生成的内容越来越多地出现在互联网上，其再次被用作训练数据可能导致模型性能下降（模型折叠）。作者希望通过一种方法检测生成内容，避免这一问题。

Method: 提出了BitMark，比特级水印技术，在生成图像的比特流中嵌入人眼不可见但可检测的水印信号，以维护图像质量和生成速度，同时提高对水印移除技术的鲁棒性。

Result: BitMark能够在保持生成质量的同时，成功嵌入水印，且当带有水印的图像被用于训练其它模型时，生成的内容同样携带水印，具备高放射性。

Conclusion: BitMark提供了一种有效的检测生成内容的方法，有助于预防文本到图像生成模型中常见的模型折叠现象的发生。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视图一致性和几何细节上表现较差，因此需要一种能够同时整合几何和感知先验的新方法。

Method: 利用几何先验、感知先验和高斯噪声初始化三个高斯分支，通过先验相互作用和基于重投影策略的深度一致性优化3D重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在新视图合成和3D重建上优于现有方法，实现了高保真、鲁棒和一致性的3D对象生成。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合几何与感知先验，并提供了一种无需额外训练的单视图3D重建方案，为3D生成领域带来了新的进展。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural
appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible
interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on
fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D
information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their
results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric
detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly
integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model
training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,
we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,
perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures
the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained
diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D
Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception
priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth
consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results
of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督领域适配方法在处理Sim2Real领域间差异时，往往缺乏鲁棒且与领域无关的描述符，难以捕捉全局拓扑信息，因此存在过拟合源领域的风险，限制了泛化性能。

Method: 提出拓扑感知建模（TAM）框架，通过利用低级高频3D结构来表征全局空间拓扑，并设计了一个新型的自监督学习任务来建模局部几何特征的拓扑关系。此外，结合跨领域对比学习和自训练策略，减小伪标签噪声影响，增强适配过程的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个公共的Sim2Real基准测试上，实验结果验证了TAM框架的有效性，在所有评估任务中相较于现有技术方法都有显著改进。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过设计拓扑感知框架，成功缩小了模拟到现实中的领域差距，显著提升了对象点云分类任务的泛化性能。

Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is
often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to
differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated
using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D
sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits
the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,
domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological
information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the
source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware
Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach
mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized
by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological
relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning
task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines
cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the
impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation
process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks. The source code of this
work will be available at https://github.com/zou-longkun/TAG.git.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing
a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing
methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases
the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards.
To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic
Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the
gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that
injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion
patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360.
We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D

Conclusion: 该研究成功通过GroundFlow为3D视觉定位方法引入时间推理能力，在多个数据集上取得了最新最优表现。

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences
of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed
steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with
multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from
each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as
"it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires
grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information
from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an
effective module for collecting related historical information,
state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the
SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for
temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we
demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG
baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark,
even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.
Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step
information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling
GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain
its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work
introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the
long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive
video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer
models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient
processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel
hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear
scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length
videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework
incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a
state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal
information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a
local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate
local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models
temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a
hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete
phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the
network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on
MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前全景图像处理中受限于失真、透视遮挡和有限标注的问题，现有的无监督域适配方法需依赖源针孔数据，限制了其实用性。

Method: 提出了SFOASS任务，并设计了UNLOCK框架，其中包含全景伪标签学习和无模板驱动的上下文学习模块，可在无需源数据或目标标注的情况下提升全景分割性能。

Result: 在真实到真实以及合成到真实的适配中，UNLOCK实现了与源依赖方法相当的性能指标，并在mAAP和mAP方面达到最佳，分别为10.9和11.6，同时在mAPQ上比源仅方法提高了+4.3。

Conclusion: UNLOCK框架在全景分割任务中取得了优异性能，验证了其在源无关设定下的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet
faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited
annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge
from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require
access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical
task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and
propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context
Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni
Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting
without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models
to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware
reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both
real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results
show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to
source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and
11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，通过CAA模块优化特征通道注意力及GOS模块实现全局最优选择，用于提升图像到点云配准的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法中图像与点云特征通道间的注意力差异和场景中相似结构导致的冗余匹配，影响了配准的准确性。

Method: 引入了两个模块：Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA)用于增强模态内特征并抑制跨模态敏感性；Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS)用于用全局优化替代局部选择。

Result: 在RGB-D Scenes V2和7-Scenes数据集上进行了实验，方法在图像到点云的配准任务中达到了目前最好的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了现有跨模态匹配中的注意力差异及冗余匹配问题，显著提升了配准准确性。

Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting
image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense
pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel
attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching
results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar
structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal
matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment
Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances
intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces
local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and
7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in image-to-point cloud registration.

*Shadman Sobhan,Kazi Abrar Mahmud,Abduz Zami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedPrompt是一种结合大语言模型（LLM）和模块化卷积神经网络，用于医疗图像分析的统一框架，具备广泛的任务适应能力和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗影像分析系统通常任务专一，缺乏灵活性，无法支持用户自定义工作流。该研究旨在开发一个统一框架，突破这些局限，提升扩展性和部署能力。

Method: 提出MedPrompt框架，结合少样本提示的大语言模型（Llama-4-17B）进行任务规划，与模块化CNN（DeepFusionLab）处理图像。通过动态路由任务特定权重，避免了新增任务时重训框架的需求，实现高效扩展。

Result: 在19个公开数据集上的12项任务测试中，系统达到了97%的指令执行正确率，平均推理延迟为2.5秒。分割（例如肺Dice 0.9856）和分类（结核F1 0.9744）性能均表现优异。

Conclusion: MedPrompt有效结合了LLM的高解释性与模块化CNN的高效性，显著提升了医疗影像分析的可扩展性和实时应用潜力。

Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring
separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility
to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce
MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language
Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional
Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM
interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically
route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids
retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific
weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated
MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging
modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting
and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of
2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab
achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and
strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall,
MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the
interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的开放词汇语义分割（OVS）框架，通过高质量的参考数据集显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在依赖的模型性能及参考数据质量受限，难以满足无需训练即可进行开放词汇语义分割的任务需求。

Method: 使用高质量的参考集合，通过数据管道构建具有良好配对的分割文本嵌入，并采用简单的基于相似性的检索方式。

Result: 方法在十个基准数据集上进行评估，结果表明其性能优于现有所有无需训练的OVS方法。

Conclusion: 数据质量在提升无需训练的开放词汇语义分割方法中起到关键作用，应采用数据为中心的设计策略。

Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment
images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model
fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of
pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex
retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by
the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets.
In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for
this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a
high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With
this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a
data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text
embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential
effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS
approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing
OVS without training. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiweix/ReME .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DiMPLe的新方法，用于在多模态学习中解耦视觉和语言模态中的关键特征和干扰特征，从而提高泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，视觉数据中的伪相关性常会影响模型在分布外数据上的表现。现有方法主要关注图像特征，而DiMPLe的目标是同时解耦模态内和跨模态的特征，以实现更好的泛化能力和应对分布变化的能力。

Method: DiMPLe结合了三大目标：1.最小化关键特征与干扰特征之间的信息互补，2.对干扰特征进行正则化，3.对关键特征进行对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，与CoOp-OOD方法相比，DiMPLe在11个不同数据集上的平均性能更优，在基类准确率上提升了15.27，在新类准确率上提升了44.31。

Conclusion: DiMPLe不仅显著提高了在未知类别上的泛化能力，还在面对分布变化时表现出更强的鲁棒性，展现其在多模态学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel
approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and
language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual
data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods
focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and
across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better
generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our
method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization
between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization,
and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when
averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in
base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的子空间聚类方法难以处理复杂背景下的视频帧分布问题，提出更好的方法以提升人体动作分割的效果。

Method: 提出了$\text{TR}^2\text{C}$方法，通过联合学习结构化表示和关联性，以实现视频帧序列的分割。

Result: 实验在五个基准数据集上进行，证明了$\text{TR}^2\text{C}$方法结合不同特征提取器均可达到当前最优表现。

Conclusion: $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$方法在提高人体运动分割任务中的表现方面具有显著优势，同时验证了其在多个数据集中的通用性及有效性。

Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into
non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention
recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace
clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional
temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the
frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may
not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering
($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and
affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured
representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent
and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We
conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

*Munish Monga,Vishal Chudasama,Pankaj Wasnik,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD)的新框架，可以同时处理类别和领域变化，无需示例数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（CIOD和DIOD）只能处理类别增量或领域增量中的一种问题，这限制了其在真实世界应用中的效用。

Method: 提出了一种称为DuET的模型结合框架，利用任务算术和一种新的方向一致性损失来实现稳定的增量学习；并引入了保留-适应性指数（RAI）进行全面的模型评估。

Result: 在Pascal Series和Diverse Weather Series数据集上的实验结果显示，DuET方法比现有方法总体提升了11%-13%的RAI指数，同时保持了较高的模型记忆能力（Avg RI）。

Conclusion: DuET框架能够在无需示例的情况下，实现实时增量目标检测，并在多任务情境下表现优越。

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and
surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously
adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class
Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection
(DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen
domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new
classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more
practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an
exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging
framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign
conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods,
DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function
as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both
retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI),
which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting
and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common
ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series
demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while
preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39%
RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks),
outperforming existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频虚拟试穿方法在时空一致性和衣物细节保留上存在问题。

Method: 本文将视频虚拟试穿定义为条件视频修复任务，基于全3D时空注意力的Diffusion Transformer框架，并引入掩膜策略与多阶段训练来逐步适配。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViTI模型在定量和定性评估上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViTI通过重构任务定义与模型框架，实现了更高时空一致性及衣物细节再现，为视频虚拟试穿领域提供了一个新方向。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in
consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output
video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the
details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.
Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results
due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,
though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal
attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,
which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In
this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement
video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different
from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem
instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better
spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video
inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D
spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video
garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage
training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with
appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal
consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to
the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as
expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI
is superior to previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中伪标注的高噪声导致教师模型崩塌，从而严重影响学生模型性能，亟需更可靠的伪标注生成方法。

Method: 提出目标领域划分策略，将目标图像分为易和难子集，同时引入基于查询标记的对抗模块，在学生-教师框架中减小特征域间差异。

Result: TITAN方法在四个自然图片数据集和两个医学数据集上取得显著优异的表现，相较现有方法，在多个基准测试中提升mAP最高达22.7%。

Conclusion: TITAN显著缓解了领域差异问题，有效提高了无监督领域自适应目标检测的鲁棒性，并在多数据集上达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD)
problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must
adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem
employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where
pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further
fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades
drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high
noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a
significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we
propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which
separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source
(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance
to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher
detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the
source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into
a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two
feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets
and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior
performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7
percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks,
respectively.

Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images
remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level
controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA)
framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and
local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image
(T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes
selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This
allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text
rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further
enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to
guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and
the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote
disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The
datasets and source code will be available for academic use.

Motivation: 现有外科视频生成方法缺乏对细粒度的手术动作和阶段一致性的理解，无法实现高质量、符合实际的模拟。

Method: 提出HieraSurg框架，包括两个扩散模型：一个预测未来语义变化的分割模型，另一个通过结合细粒度视觉特征生成视频。

Conclusion: HieraSurg框架有效融合了多层次外科信息，在外科实际应用中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction
following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation.
Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are
unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and
phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary
for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a
hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two
specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame,
HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a
segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a
second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with
fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and
integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages
surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical
phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental
results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model
significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively,
showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher
frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when
provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for
practical surgical applications.

Conclusion: CoSMAE通过数据和模型级别的创新设计，有效提高了遥感领域持续学习的性能，为进一步研究提供了公开实现代码。

Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new
tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has
gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS,
while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting.
This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is
costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we
propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of
masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two
components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data
mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions
by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous
tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling
knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by
interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge
distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at
the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and
reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that
CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art
CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored
challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA)
systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework
designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual
documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language
models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer
spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from
the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations
across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level
granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation
studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning.
Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the
limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the
effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave
the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in
real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available at

Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言模型在处理涉及人体姿势和动作的复杂任务时表现不佳，因此需要专门的视觉-语言指令跟随数据来改进模型性能。

Method: 通过整合人体关键点与传统视觉特征（如字幕和边界框）生成新的数据集，包括200,328个样本，并用于微调模型。研究还创建了一个扩展的基准(E-HPAUB)来评估模型性能。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual
understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex
visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized
vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for
generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual
features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise
understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset
comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric
tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex
reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding
Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action
understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and
evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant
improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2%
compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for

Abstract: Developing meaningful and efficient representations that separate the
fundamental structure of the data generation mechanism is crucial in
representation learning. However, Disentangled Representation Learning has not
fully shown its potential on real images, because of correlated generative
factors, their resolution and limited access to ground truth labels.
Specifically on the latter, we investigate the possibility of leveraging
synthetic data to learn general-purpose disentangled representations applicable
to real data, discussing the effect of fine-tuning and what properties of
disentanglement are preserved after the transfer. We provide an extensive
empirical study to address these issues. In addition, we propose a new
interpretable intervention-based metric, to measure the quality of factors
encoding in the representation. Our results indicate that some level of
disentanglement, transferring a representation from synthetic to real data, is
possible and effective.

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given
the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By
conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy
of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the

conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of
real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a
hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling
a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control
abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of
modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with

Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and
classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is
a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images.
Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract
per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric
representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions.
We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D
and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential
of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera
parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive
test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a
unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for
test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view
panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent
advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view
version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view
panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard
post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach
for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating
novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.
Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being
orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了电磁逆散射问题的全新视角，为电磁成像的低成本实际解决方案迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in
applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the
relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse
process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly
challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows
promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it
requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and
fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To
address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,
reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This
formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate
representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from
the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first
generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator
and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current
estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between
the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the
relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design
enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of
relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to
transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic
inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical
solutions for electromagnetic imaging.

Conclusion: 研究通过构建创新性基准和模型，提升了AI对电影语言的理解能力，并公开了相关资源以推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for
conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding,
their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded
within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation.
This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the
precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA
pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed
(predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography
dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their
substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\%
average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and
complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct
\textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k
cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through
supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL
significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on
ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We
open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial
area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene
understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate
scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a
synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive
relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and
proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former
provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional
counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or
distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and
describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene.
Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation
models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in
downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: ToosiCubix方法无需昂贵设备，使用单目数据高效生成精确3D标注，适合大规模数据集构建。

Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive
and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their
accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a
simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only
monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only
about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D
annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized
equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge,
symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each
vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8
DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem,
which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between
Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common
ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate
probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our
annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our
method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid
annotation.

Conclusion: FastRef改进了少样本工业异常检测的性能，提供了一种高效且具有实际应用潜力的方法。

Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge
for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce
environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving
prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to
systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype
representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and
efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates
through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query
features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)
anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is
achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while
the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike
conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting
makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal
transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the
gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.
For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive
prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.
Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and
RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our
approach under 1/2/4-shots.

Conclusion: 新方法在效率和性能上都优于现有的两阶段方法，开辟了直接优化参数曲线的一种高效方法。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric
curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage
methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and
parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D
parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation
caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,
parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view
optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their
geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a
novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and
edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a
curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables
differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by
multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology
optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through
linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive
evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our
one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in
producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly
optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter
count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes
(pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple
subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from
attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference
images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows
for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting
image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable
multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject
characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly
improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.

Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are
critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D
reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing
both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges
include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and
dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To
address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a
geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the
scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation
strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the
validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve
scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement
strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal
rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive
experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both
static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available
upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make
emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in
assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on
reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential
solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training
datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This
paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable
the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential
emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various
mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection
algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several
state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11,
and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency
situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing
reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be
deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for
future research in this critical safety application.

Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from
erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively
impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and
characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network
predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image
and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector
collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly
learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,
HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density
areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment
organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two
3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the
AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real
unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a
structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant
systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet
parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying
learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator
dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT

Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an
independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their
identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle
morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among
pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis
dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive
benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic
figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with
linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF
datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer
cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++
training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135,
0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and
AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for
LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows
that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be
effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning
and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in
this paper in this github repository:

Motivation: 解决交通流经常性拥堵的问题，并通过改进信号设计提高道路通行效率。

Method: 利用基于视觉的追踪系统获取六个交叉口的TMC数据，并在城市交通仿真平台中进行动态、静态和混合信号配置的实验研究。

Result: 实验结果显示，交通信号的配置方法需根据不同交通模式优化：静态方法适用于均匀分布，而混合方法在高峰和交通集中的区域表现更优。

Conclusion: 混合信号方法通过结合动态与静态信号，可有效适应高峰与非高峰的交通流量变化，并改善整体交通管理。

Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.

Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the
advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects
in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a
challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or
prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined
with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We
design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible
enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on
an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to
methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare
different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are
designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in
terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial
shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with
appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks
such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and
segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the
model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However,
these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and
loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic
foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to
quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not
make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is
truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as
automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this
work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics.
Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used
to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as
bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of
bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a
likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for
whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of
performance.

Motivation: 解决传统高引导比例在提升条件模型性能时产生的过饱和和非真实伪影问题。

Method: 引入低频信号视角，采用基于自适应阈值的冗余信息定位方法，并通过分析低频信号变化率来确定合理阈值，同时采用降权策略减少低频冗余信息影响。

Result: 在多个扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion-XL、2.1、3.0、3.5和SiT-XL）中有效缓解了过饱和和非真实伪影问题。

Conclusion: 低频改进的无分类器引导方法显著提升了扩散模型的性能，证明了减少低频冗余信息的有效性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that
use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional
terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the
conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in
oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new
perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of
redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation
and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency
improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.
Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint
the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by
analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and
current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of
redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results
demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic
artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL,
Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单向向量嵌入方法难以捕捉多模态之间的复杂与多样化关系，作者希望利用集合式方法克服这一局限性，但注意到仍存在稀疏监督和集合坍缩等问题。

Method: 通过引入最大对分配相似性（Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity），实现嵌入集合内的一对一匹配，进一步利用全局辨别损失和集合内部差异损失提高嵌入性能。

Result: 通过实验验证，该方法无需外部数据支持，在MS-COCO和Flickr30k数据集上达到了最新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 基于对集合嵌入方法的优化，该方法在图文检索任务中成功提升了效果，证明了其在捕获语义多样性和解决集合坍缩问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse
possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional
methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample,
but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across
modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple
embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more
diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise,
these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse
supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address
these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize
one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity
within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the
representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among
embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k
without relying on external data.

Conclusion: RCME框架显著增强了视觉-语言模型捕捉层次结构和表示生命之树的能力，为相关任务提供了更优秀的表现，同时代码和模型开放源代码。

Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a
significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge
by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the
transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship
between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we
introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the
explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework
optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By
leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation
model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our
experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval
tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the
existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的无训练解码框架——动态Logits校准（DLC），旨在解决大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在生成文本时的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大规模视觉语言模型表现出色，但在多模态理解过程中存在生成与视觉输入相矛盾的文本的现象（即幻觉）。现有的无训练解码策略在语义偏移、效率和细节保留上存在局限，迫切需要新的方法来更好地校正文本生成。

Method: 提出了动态Logits校准（DLC）框架，在解码时动态评估生成文本与输入图像的语义一致性，利用CLIP评估候选词与上下文语境的语义优势并动态调整输出，以更好地结合视觉证据生成文本。

Result: 广泛实验表明，DLC显著减少了LVLMs中的幻觉现象，同时因为避免多次前向传播，保留了高效的推理能力，其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DLC为解决LVLMs中的文本幻觉问题提供了一种有效且高效的解码方案，提升了模型的可信性，展示了在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by
hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing
training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the
use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during
generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,
and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a
novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text
generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC
step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image
and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of
candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual
baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually
grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time
context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring
the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted
across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,
InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces
hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference
efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an
effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations,
thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be
released on Github.

Result: 实验表明GGTalker在渲染质量、3D一致性、唇同步准确性及训练效率方面领先。

Conclusion: GGTalker通过结合通用化先验与身份特定适配，克服了现有方法的局限，在生成说话头方面表现卓越。

Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a
persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed
viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head
rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained
by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core
issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation
capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose
GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of
generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage
Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to
individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual
priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general
distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual
speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we
introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a
Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing
indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show
that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D
consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.

Conclusion: G$^{2}$D框架缓解了模态不平衡问题，成功提高了多模态学习性能，并实现了全面优化。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities
to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal
models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities
dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and
underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce
Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework
that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that
fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a
dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning
process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the
pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D
on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the
significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in classification and regression tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic
modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting.
However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original
observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly
altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a
memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities
of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with
visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank.
Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg}
car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the
most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding
3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through
orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide
complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling
photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as
demonstrated in our experiments. Project page:

Conclusion: StruMamba3D通过改进SSM和引入适应性策略有效解决了点云表示学习中的关键问题，并达到了当前最好的表现。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in
point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with
the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these
methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying
the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain
long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To
address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for
self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits.
First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial
dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update
strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions
between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method
reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input
lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental
results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our
method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40
and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge,
especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view
synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,
they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object
are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction
quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for
occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six
structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,
enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or
manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the
Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and
pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and
view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully
fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view
generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware
reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and
mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating
future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，SAM4D在Waymo-4DSeg数据集上展现了强大的跨模态分割能力及数据标注潜力。

Conclusion: SAM4D通过创新性的方法实现了高效的分割和标注效率，为自动驾驶多模态系统提供了重要支持。

Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for
promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal
Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in
a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction.
Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA),
which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and
long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically
changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop
a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets,
spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This
framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of
magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic
fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on
the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal
segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.

*Alex Costanzino,Pierluigi Zama Ramirez,Luigi Lella,Matteo Ragaglia,Alessandro Oliva,Giuseppe Lisanti,Luigi Di Stefano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SiM3D，为首个结合多视角和多模态信息的3D异常检测与分割基准，任务是生成基于体素的异常体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决制造业单样本异常检测问题，推动从合成数据到真实数据的泛化能力研究。

Method: 设计了一个包含多视角高分辨率图像和点云的多模态数据集，并提供手动标注的3D异常分割真值。同时适配现有单视角方法，为多视角3D异常检测与分割任务建立基准。

Result: 评价了这些单视角方法在新指标下的表现，强调了SiM3D在该领域的贡献。

Conclusion: SiM3D填补了多视角和多模态3D异常检测与分割的研究空白，为从合成到真实数据的泛化能力研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of
multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and
segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume.
Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing:
single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or
synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the
first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic
training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview
dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset
features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points)
for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each
type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test
samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS
task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using
novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

### [114] [Towards Probabilistic Question Answering Over Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20747)
*Chen Shen,Sajjadur Rahman,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大型表格数据的概率问答新基准LUCARIO及相应框架，结合贝叶斯网络、概率查询及大语言模型，实现混合符号-神经推理，效果显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要基于不确定性推理的概率性问题时效果欠佳。

Method: 提出LUCARIO基准，使用贝叶斯网络从表格中获取概率关系，将自然语言查询转化为概率性查询，并利用大语言模型生成答案。

Result: 实验证明与基线方法相比，该方法在概率问答任务上效果显著提高。

Conclusion: 混合符号-神经推理方法在处理复杂概率问题时表现优越，LUCARIO为该领域提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as
NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly
retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions
requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new
benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data.
Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language
queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements
over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

*Victor Ojewale,Inioluwa Deborah Raji,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于多语言功能的新基准测试集，提供更贴近实际性能的跨语言评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言评估基准无法充分理解模型在实际多语言环境下的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将现有的功能性基准模板翻译为法语、西班牙语、印地语、阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语，创建多语言功能性基准CL-GSM Symbolic和CL-IFEval，并依据这些新基准测试模型性能。

Result: 发现一些传统的多语言基准更贴近功能性表现，模型性能和鲁棒性在不同语言间差异显著。例如，实验中M-GSM到CL-GSM Symbolic在英语、法语和西班牙语中分别出现24%、17%和18%的性能下降，而Belebele到CL-IFEval的性能下降为15%-24%，M-MMLU到CL-IFEval的下降仅0.5%到3%。另外，阿拉伯语和英语的模型表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 现有多语言基准在功能性表现上的代表性有限，新提出的基准能更准确评估模型的实际性能和跨语言鲁棒性，特别在特定语言上的表现差异需要关注。

Abstract: Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via
static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these
evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical
performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In
response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade
School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following
Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from
English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available
for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that
some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more
closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease
in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish
respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages
between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between
M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across
languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English)
being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

*Chenglei Si,Tatsunori Hashimoto,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs生成的研究想法在执行后，其研究成果评分下降幅度比人类专家撰写的更显著，表明LLMs在生成真正有效的研究想法方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探索LLMs在生成新颖且有效的科学研究想法方面的能力，及其在研究执行后的表现。

Method: 带领43位专家研究者随机执行由人类专家或LLM生成的研究点子，每位专家花费超过100小时撰写短篇论文，结果由NLP领域专家评估评分。

Result: 研究结果表明，执行后LLMs生成的研究点子的评分在各评估指标上的下降幅度显著大于人类点子，有些指标甚至逆转为人类点子优于LLMs点子。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在生成真正有效的研究点子方面仍存在局限，表明仅通过初始创意阶段来评估研究点子的效果存在挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the
scientific research pipeline. A key capability for this process is the ability
to generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in
which LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert
ideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should
also result in better research after being executed. To test whether
AI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution
study by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,
either written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100
hours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the
experiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP
researchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after
execution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more
than expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,
effectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human
ideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review
scores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is
a flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This
ideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating
truly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas
in the absence of execution outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MultiFinRAG的框架，用于解决金融问答中的跨模态推理问题，通过分层回退策略和紧凑的多模态提取显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融文档包含密集文本、表格与图形等多模态数据，传统大型语言模型因代币限制和布局丢失难以应对。

Method: 提出一个检索增强生成框架（MultiFinRAG），通过多模态提取、基于相似度的检索索引及分层回退策略，实现精准检索与多模态推理。

Result: 在复杂金融问答任务中，MultiFinRAG在准确性上比ChatGPT-4o提高19个百分点。

Conclusion: MultiFinRAG能够在普通硬件上实现高效多模态联合推理，为金融问答提供了强大的新工具。

Abstract: Financial documents--such as 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and investor presentations--span
hundreds of pages and combine diverse modalities, including dense narrative
text, structured tables, and complex figures. Answering questions over such
content often requires joint reasoning across modalities, which strains
traditional large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines due to token limitations, layout loss, and fragmented
cross-modal context. We introduce MultiFinRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation
framework purpose-built for financial QA. MultiFinRAG first performs multimodal
extraction by grouping table and figure images into batches and sending them to
a lightweight, quantized open-source multimodal LLM, which produces both
structured JSON outputs and concise textual summaries. These outputs, along
with narrative text, are embedded and indexed with modality-aware similarity
thresholds for precise retrieval. A tiered fallback strategy then dynamically
escalates from text-only to text+table+image contexts when necessary, enabling
cross-modal reasoning while reducing irrelevant context. Despite running on
commodity hardware, MultiFinRAG achieves 19 percentage points higher accuracy
than ChatGPT-4o (free-tier) on complex financial QA tasks involving text,
tables, images, and combined multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次使用社会科学工具测评大语言模型在面对日常暴力内容时的表现，发现其文本生成与内部偏好的暴力倾向不一致，并表现出跨人口差异的矛盾性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在面对真实情境的能力以及是否存在潜在的偏见。

Method: 使用Validated Violent Behavior Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ)工具，结合调节种族、年龄、地理身份的角色设定，对六种LLM在零样本设定下统一评估。

Result: LLM在文本生成与内在暴力反应倾向上表现出显著不一致，并且在不同人口群体间显现出与现有社会科学研究结果矛盾的暴力倾向差异。

Conclusion: 虽然大语言模型在暴力内容评测中的表现尚具潜力，但其对于不同情境的理解及公正性仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for detecting and
responding to violent content online, yet their ability to reason about morally
ambiguous, real-world scenarios remains underexamined. We present the first
study to evaluate LLMs using a validated social science instrument designed to
measure human response to everyday conflict, namely the Violent Behavior
Vignette Questionnaire (VBVQ). To assess potential bias, we introduce
persona-based prompting that varies race, age, and geographic identity within
the United States. Six LLMs developed across different geopolitical and
organizational contexts are evaluated under a unified zero-shot setting. Our
study reveals two key findings: (1) LLMs surface-level text generation often
diverges from their internal preference for violent responses; (2) their
violent tendencies vary across demographics, frequently contradicting
established findings in criminology, social science, and psychology.

TL;DR: 本文讨论自动事实核查在医学领域的应用，以及目前存在的挑战和改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术进步提高了事实核查的能力，但在医学领域面对高风险决策和复杂文献的情况下，现有的自动化系统未能广泛使用。

Method: 研究了临床专家如何通过综合医学证据核查社交媒体中的真实声明，并揭示医学事实核查中的核心挑战。

Result: 发现了事实核查中与临床实验数据连接困难、声明表述模糊导致的意图错位，以及主观的真实性标签问题。

Conclusion: 建议将事实核查视为一种互动沟通问题，而非单纯的端到端流程。

Abstract: Technological progress has led to concrete advancements in tasks that were
regarded as challenging, such as automatic fact-checking. Interest in adopting
these systems for public health and medicine has grown due to the high-stakes
nature of medical decisions and challenges in critically appraising a vast and
diverse medical literature. Evidence-based medicine connects to every
individual, and yet the nature of it is highly technical, rendering the medical
literacy of majority users inadequate to sufficiently navigate the domain. Such
problems with medical communication ripens the ground for end-to-end
fact-checking agents: check a claim against current medical literature and
return with an evidence-backed verdict. And yet, such systems remain largely
unused. To understand this, we present the first study examining how clinical
experts verify real claims from social media by synthesizing medical evidence.
In searching for this upper-bound, we reveal fundamental challenges in
end-to-end fact-checking when applied to medicine: Difficulties connecting
claims in the wild to scientific evidence in the form of clinical trials;
ambiguities in underspecified claims mixed with mismatched intentions; and
inherently subjective veracity labels. We argue that fact-checking should be
approached and evaluated as an interactive communication problem, rather than
an end-to-end process.

Conclusion: 这些方法改良了语言模型的适应能力，对其高效稳健的广泛应用有重要意义，同时也向人工通用智能的目标迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet
adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging.
As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often
underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small
task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These
limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world
language tasks.
  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream
applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant
knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training
technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,
we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces
memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also
introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better
follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their
performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.
Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop
spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more
comprehensively.
  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results
demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,
efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of
applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and
efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general
intelligence.

Motivation: 目前多语言LLM的训练面临高质量数据筛选和去重的困难，尤其是涉及多种语言时效率较低。本研究提出针对性解决方案。

Method: 利用FineWeb开发了一个新数据集筛选管道，自动适配多语言；设计了九种语言测试任务来评估效果；引入一种基于重复计数和质量的简单重平衡方法。

Result: 新方法生成的语料库使模型性能优于先前数据集；重平衡方法进一步提升模型表现；扩展管道至超1000种语言，并生成FineWeb2数据集（20TB，50亿文档）。

Conclusion: FineWeb2及相关管道大幅提高了训练多语言LLM的效率和效果，并为多语言研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Pre-training state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) requires vast
amounts of clean and diverse text data. While the open development of large
high-quality English pre-training datasets has seen substantial recent
progress, training performant multilingual LLMs remains a challenge, in large
part due to the inherent difficulty of tailoring filtering and deduplication
pipelines to a large number of languages. In this work, we introduce a new
pre-training dataset curation pipeline based on FineWeb that can be
automatically adapted to support any language. We extensively ablate our
pipeline design choices on a set of nine diverse languages, guided by a set of
meaningful and informative evaluation tasks that were chosen through a novel
selection process based on measurable criteria. Ultimately, we show that our
pipeline can be used to create non-English corpora that produce more performant
models than prior datasets. We additionally introduce a straightforward and
principled approach to rebalance datasets that takes into consideration both
duplication count and quality, providing an additional performance uplift.
Finally, we scale our pipeline to over 1000 languages using almost 100 Common
Crawl snapshots to produce FineWeb2, a new 20 terabyte (5 billion document)
multilingual dataset which we release along with our pipeline, training, and
evaluation codebases.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact
embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text
embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key
innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation
learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional
transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length
embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on
large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on
high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup
parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a
focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult
samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard
negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories
of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost
both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive
evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English
show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and
competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new
standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B

Motivation: 探讨模型如何通过优化使参数更新效果能够模拟提示的作用，提升语言模型处理新信息的能力。

Method: 采用基于梯度的元学习方法，以模型自身的提示预测作为训练目标，避免依赖真实标签，从而进行元训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个任务上提升了模型性能，例如“反转诅咒”任务及单次梯度更新后的文本理解任务。

Conclusion: 通过适当的初始化，梯度下降的表达能力可以得到很好的发挥，为长上下文建模和梯度学习的泛化能力提供了新的思路。

Abstract: There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.

TL;DR: 研究旨在改进语言模型的个性建模，提出了一种新方法用以精确控制个性特质的表现强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型个性建模多基于Big Five框架，缺乏细致的个性维度和强度控制，难以达到预期的人类般交互体验。

Method: 通过将Machine Personality Inventory (MPI)扩展至16 Personality Factor (16PF)模型，结合一个被称为Specific Attribute Control (SAC)的框架，使用形容词语义锚定和五个强度因子进行个性强度的动态调整与评估。

Result: 实验表明，将个性强度建模为连续谱可以显著提高个性表现的一致性和可控性，且不同特质间表现出心理学上一致的相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究方法使得人机交互更接近真实的个性化沟通，可在医疗、教育、面试等领域实现新应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide
range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them
to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this
expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM
personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models
face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which
only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for
controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending
the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five
model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing
expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured
framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and
dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces
adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and
leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:
\textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and
\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity
as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable
personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe
that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related
traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize
multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in
isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine
interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing
processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.

Motivation: 大语言模型在金融领域的落地表现尚存疑点，尤其是对领域特定知识的掌握和应用。本研究试图通过专门设计的CA-Ben基准弥补这一研究空白。

Method: 引入CA-Ben基准，该基准基于印度注册会计师协会的考试内容设计，包括基础、中级、高级三个阶段，评估了六种主流LLMs的表现，并通过严格的评估协议进行测试。

Result: 测试表明，各模型在法律和定量推理上表现差异显著，其中Claude 3.5 Sonnet和GPT-4o表现更优，但在数值计算和法律解读方面仍存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在金融领域的强弱点表明需要通过混合推理和检索增强生成方法提升量化分析和法律解释的准确性。

Abstract: Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are
significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models
effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains
uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context,
this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets
derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced
CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1
405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated
using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and
legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal
interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis
and accurate legal interpretation.

Abstract: Query classification, including multiple subtasks such as intent and category
prediction, is vital to e-commerce applications. E-commerce queries are usually
short and lack context, and the information between labels cannot be used,
resulting in insufficient prior information for modeling. Most existing
industrial query classification methods rely on users' posterior click behavior
to construct training samples, resulting in a Matthew vicious cycle.
Furthermore, the subtasks of query classification lack a unified framework,
leading to low efficiency for algorithm optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Scalable Unified Framework
(SSUF), containing multiple enhanced modules to unify the query classification
tasks. The knowledge-enhanced module uses world knowledge to enhance query
representations and solve the problem of insufficient query information. The
label-enhanced module uses label semantics and semi-supervised signals to
reduce the dependence on posterior labels. The structure-enhanced module
enhances the label representation based on the complex label relations. Each
module is highly pluggable, and input features can be added or removed as
needed according to each subtask. We conduct extensive offline and online A/B
experiments, and the results show that SSUF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本论文提出一个名为MT2-CSD的大型数据集，专注于多目标、多轮次对话中的立场检测，且展示了其在此任务上的复杂性。此外，提出了LLM-CRAN模型，其显著提升了对话立场检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社交媒体中的立场检测大多聚焦于单一实例，忽略了真实多方讨论情境的复杂性。缺乏真实社交媒体互动动态的数据集限制了对话式立场检测的研究进展。

Method: 构建了目前最大的对话立场检测数据集MT2-CSD，并提出了大语言模型增强的对话关系注意网络（LLM-CRAN）。该模型利用语言模型的推理能力以提升对对话的理解。

Result: LLM-CRAN在MT2-CSD数据集上的性能优于强基线模型，显示其在对话立场检测任务上的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过新颖的数据集与模型，本研究提升了对话式立场检测任务的效果，为多方对话场景中的研究与应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: In the realm of contemporary social media, automatic stance detection is
pivotal for opinion mining, as it synthesizes and examines user perspectives on
contentious topics to uncover prevailing trends and sentiments. Traditional
stance detection research often targets individual instances, thereby limiting
its capacity to model multi-party discussions typical in real social media
scenarios. This shortcoming largely stems from the scarcity of datasets that
authentically capture the dynamics of social media interactions, hindering
advancements in conversational stance detection. In this paper, we introduce
MT2-CSD, a comprehensive dataset for multi-target, multi-turn conversational
stance detection. To the best of our knowledge, MT2-CSD is the largest dataset
available for this purpose, comprising 24,457 annotated instances and
exhibiting the greatest conversational depth, thereby presenting new challenges
for stance detection. To address these challenges, we propose the Large
Language model enhanced Conversational Relational Attention Network (LLM-CRAN),
which exploits the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to improve conversational
understanding. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the efficacy of
LLM-CRAN on the MT2-CSD dataset. The experimental results indicate that
LLM-CRAN significantly outperforms strong baseline models in the task of
conversational stance detection.

*Papa Séga Wade,Mihai Andries,Ioannis Kanellos,Thierry Moudenc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于块的自动流利度评估方法，通过结合自监督学习模型（Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、WavLM）以及层次化CNN-BiLSTM框架，改善了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动流利度评估（AFA）对语音节奏、停顿和不流利性捕捉不足，尤其是针对非母语者，因此需要更强大的方法来提高评估的精准度。

Method: 通过Silero语音活动检测将语音分割成呼吸组块，应用自监督学习模型融合并调整声学和语言特征，加入块级流利度标记，然后由层级的CNN-BiLSTM捕获局部及长期依赖关系。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上分别提高了F1得分2.8和4.2点，皮尔森相关系数6.2和4.0点，超越了Pyannote.audio分割基线。

Conclusion: 基于块的多SSL融合方法有效提升了语音流利度评估，但未来应进一步研究方言不规则音调的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: 提出一种解决跨模态句子表示中对齐问题的方法：DALR，通过细粒度跨模态对齐和全局模态内对齐提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态句子表示学习注重粗粒度对齐，受跨模态不匹配和模态内部语义分歧问题困扰，降低了效果。

Method: 通过一致性学习进行细粒度跨模态对齐，结合排序蒸馏强化全局模态内对齐，实现精准句子表示优化。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）及迁移学习（TR）任务上验证了方法的有效性，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALR有效解决了现有方法中的对齐问题，提升了多模态句子表示的质量。

Abstract: Previous multimodal sentence representation learning methods have achieved
impressive performance. However, most approaches focus on aligning images and
text at a coarse level, facing two critical challenges:cross-modal misalignment
bias and intra-modal semantic divergence, which significantly degrade sentence
representation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DALR
(Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For
cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens
negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to
achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that
sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a
more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and
enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global
intra-modal alignment learning. Comprehensive experiments on semantic textual
similarity (STS) and transfer (TR) tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach, consistently demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Method: 设计了一种基于质心的记忆机制，将静态知识与动态历史QA对结合，用于检索、生成和高效存储。

Result: 在三个工业CQA数据集上，ComRAG框架在向量相似性上最多提升25.9%，延迟减少8.7%至23.3%，迭代时块增长率从 20.23%降低至2.06%。

Conclusion: ComRAG框架显著提高了工业CQA的效率和效果，可作为一种有效的检索增强生成方法。

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms can be deemed as important
knowledge bases in community, but effectively leveraging historical
interactions and domain knowledge in real-time remains a challenge. Existing
methods often underutilize external knowledge, fail to incorporate dynamic
historical QA context, or lack memory mechanisms suited for industrial
deployment. We propose ComRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for
real-time industrial CQA that integrates static knowledge with dynamic
historical QA pairs via a centroid-based memory mechanism designed for
retrieval, generation, and efficient storage. Evaluated on three industrial CQA
datasets, ComRAG consistently outperforms all baselines--achieving up to 25.9%
improvement in vector similarity, reducing latency by 8.7% to 23.3%, and
lowering chunk growth from 20.23% to 2.06% over iterations.

Result: Progtuning减少了约25%的参数更新量，并在多种适应场景下证明了其竞争性能。

Conclusion: Progtuning能够有效地优化资源使用、减少参数更新量，同时在多样化场景中保持高效、优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a promising technique for leveraging Transformer-based
language models in downstream tasks. As model sizes continue to grow, updating
all model parameters becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods effectively address this issue by selectively updating a
small subset of parameters. However, fine-tuning and most existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods require updating the same number of
parameters as the initial size, ignoring the unequal contribution across
Transformer blocks and leading to extremely inefficient allocation of computing
resources. In this paper, we propose Progtuning, the novel fine-tuning
framework combined with progressive learning for Transformer-based language
models. Specifically, Progtuning progressively reduces the number of updated
transformer blocks based on the contribution. Remarkably, Progtuning optimizes
resource allocation and reduces the number of updated parameters by
approximately 25\%, while still maintaining competitive performance. And it
also exhibits high adaptability with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,
demonstrating excellent performance across various adaptation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 目前自回归语言模型存在解码慢和全局连贯性差的缺点，研究提出了Cosmos模型，通过在压缩的平滑潜在空间中应用扩散模型实现并行生成和灵活控制，提升了生成质量和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有自回归语言模型的局限，通过使用扩散模型和潜在空间来实现加速和优化文本生成。

Method: 提出了一个结合扩散模型的文本生成方法——Cosmos，它在一个专门设计的潜在空间中操作，该空间由一个自动编码器学习，并结合预训练语言模型的激活进行语义对齐和增强。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在保持与常规扩散模型生成质量相当的同时，实现了潜在空间的8倍压缩。此外，通过增加潜在序列长度，Cosmos优于当前的自回归模型和基于扩散的模型，同时推理速度快2倍以上。

Conclusion: Cosmos在故事生成、问题生成、文本总结和情感过滤等多种任务中表现出色，在生成质量和速度上优于现有许多方法，证明其在文本生成领域的潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models dominate modern text generation, yet their
sequential nature introduces fundamental limitations: decoding is slow, and
maintaining global coherence remains challenging. Diffusion models offer a
promising alternative by enabling parallel generation and flexible control;
however, their application to text generation is hindered by the high
dimensionality of token-level representations. We introduce Cosmos, a novel
approach to text generation that operates entirely in a compressed, smooth
latent space tailored specifically for diffusion. This space is learned using
an autoencoder trained simultaneously for token-level reconstruction and
alignment with frozen activations from a pretrained language encoder, providing
robust semantic grounding and enabling effective perturbation-based
augmentations. Empirically, we demonstrate that text representations can be
compressed by $8\times$ while maintaining generation quality comparable to
token-level diffusion models. Furthermore, increasing the latent sequence
length allows Cosmos to surpass both diffusion-based and autoregressive
baselines. We evaluate Cosmos on four diverse generative tasks including story
generation, question generation, summarization, and detoxification and compare
it with various generative paradigms. Cosmos achieves comparable or superior
generation quality while offering more than $2\times$ faster inference.

Abstract: Turn-taking prediction models are essential components in spoken dialogue
systems and conversational robots. Recent approaches leverage transformer-based
architectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this
study, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be
dynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and
explicit control through instructions such as "faster" or "calmer" adapting
dynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds
upon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating
textual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a
cross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using
over 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data
for the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a
large language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences. Experimental
results demonstrated that the proposed model improved prediction accuracy and
effectively varied turn-taking timing behaviors according to the textual
prompts.

Result: 在三个专用术语提取基准上的实验表明，语法检索方法可以提高F1分数，且这种方法在跨领域和领域内设定中均表现良好。

Conclusion: 语法提示对大语言模型适配术语提取任务至关重要，证明了基于语法检索的方法是一种有效的域无关策略。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) identifies domain-specific expressions that
are crucial for downstream tasks such as machine translation and information
retrieval. Although large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
various NLP tasks, their potential for ATE has scarcely been examined. We
propose a retrieval-based prompting strategy that, in the few-shot setting,
selects demonstrations according to \emph{syntactic} rather than semantic
similarity. This syntactic retrieval method is domain-agnostic and provides
more reliable guidance for capturing term boundaries. We evaluate the approach
in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, analyzing how lexical overlap
between the query sentence and its retrieved examples affects performance.
Experiments on three specialized ATE benchmarks show that syntactic retrieval
improves F1-score. These findings highlight the importance of syntactic cues
when adapting LLMs to terminology-extraction tasks.

Result: 实验表明，即使是最先进的多模态模型在奖励建模方面的性能仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: 需要为多模态大语言模型强化奖励建模能力的专门训练，Agent-RewardBench为此提供了一个重要工具。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show
promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence.
However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents
struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to
use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select
reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench
targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The
benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and
real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and
safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the
assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a
more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3)
Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse
models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification
to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the
need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at
github.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成越来越逼真的虚假文本，需要明确是否可以通过简易分类器实现可靠检测。

Method: 使用统计分类器评估虚假文本检测能力，特别考察侦探小说风格中欺骗性文本的生成与检测。

Result: Gemini模型在版本提升中表现出更强的欺骗性生成能力，而GPT模型无明显提升。

Conclusion: 尽管模型规模变大，检测虚假文本的能力可能依然可靠，但未来新模型架构可能会增强文本欺骗性。

Abstract: Large language models can produce convincing "fake text" in domains such as
academic writing, product reviews, and political news. Many approaches have
been investigated for the detection of artificially generated text. While this
may seem to presage an endless "arms race", we note that newer LLMs use ever
more parameters, training data, and energy, while relatively simple classifiers
demonstrate a good level of detection accuracy with modest resources. To
approach the question of whether the models' ability to beat the detectors may
therefore reach a plateau, we examine the ability of statistical classifiers to
identify "fake text" in the style of classical detective fiction. Over a 0.5
version increase, we found that Gemini showed an increased ability to generate
deceptive text, while GPT did not. This suggests that reliable detection of
fake text may remain feasible even for ever-larger models, though new model
architectures may improve their deceptiveness

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在生成有益批评和改进初始解决方案方面能力有限，需要新的方法来增强其反思和推理能力。

Method: 开发了Double-Checker框架，通过对1,730个自我批评实例进行微调，使模型能够在推理中进行迭代性自我批评和改进，直至其自评为正确。

Result: Double-Checker显著提升了基准测试中的推理能力，例如AIME基准的pass@1表现从4.4%提高到18.2%。

Conclusion: Double-Checker提供了一种增强语言模型可信度和有效性的有效方法，未来的研究可以进一步探索结构性自我批评的潜力。

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like
reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate
informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this
paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit
self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By
fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker
empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during
inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated
critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive
suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique
significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably,
our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME
benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These
results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and
effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）在缺乏上下文信息时容易生成无依据推断，因此需要一种手段确保其生成的内容有据可依，从而提升可信度和一致性。

Method: 本文采用轻量化编码器模型（如RoBERTa和NomicBERT），并基于精心构建的数据集对其进行微调，用于检测查询是否基于给定文档内容。

Conclusion: 通过结合轻量模型与任务特定微调，能够在大幅减少资源消耗的同时，维持高性能的查询可靠性检测，从而提升自然语言处理任务的效率。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external context significantly
improves their performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
LLMs struggle to answer queries reliably when the provided context lacks
information, often resorting to ungrounded speculation or internal knowledge.
Groundedness - generating responses strictly supported by the context - is
essential for ensuring factual consistency and trustworthiness. This study
focuses on detecting whether a given query is grounded in a document provided
in context before the costly answer generation by LLMs. Such a detection
mechanism can significantly reduce both inference time and resource
consumption. We show that lightweight, task specific encoder models such as
RoBERTa and NomicBERT, fine-tuned on curated datasets, can achieve accuracy
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama3 8B and GPT4o, in
groundedness detection while reducing inference latency by orders of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨仅依赖语言上下文能否检测出对话中具有视觉背景的指称。

Method: 通过预训练的大语言模型，结合少量数据集和参数高效的微调，实现文本上下文中的指称范围预测。

Result: 即使使用中等规模的语言模型和小型数据集，文本方法依然有效，显示语言上下文的显著性。

Conclusion: 尽管文本方法有效，但任务本质上是多模态问题，单一模态方法存在局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language
modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually
grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to
which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that
have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the
conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to
perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding
conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token
prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM,
relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only
approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the
linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task
represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental
to unimodal approaches.

struggle with providing professional literary criticism for works with profound
thoughts and complex narratives. This paper proposes GLASS (Greimas Literary
Analysis via Semiotic Square), a structured analytical framework based on
Greimas Semiotic Square (GSS), to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct in-depth
literary analysis. GLASS facilitates the rapid dissection of narrative
structures and deep meanings in narrative works. We propose the first dataset
for GSS-based literary criticism, featuring detailed analyses of 48 works. Then
we propose quantitative metrics for GSS-based literary criticism using the
LLM-as-a-judge paradigm. Our framework's results, compared with expert
criticism across multiple works and LLMs, show high performance. Finally, we
applied GLASS to 39 classic works, producing original and high-quality analyses
that address existing research gaps. This research provides an AI-based tool
for literary research and education, offering insights into the cognitive
mechanisms underlying literary engagement.

### [142] [Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384)
*Guanting Dong,Xiaoxi Li,Yuyao Zhang,Mengjie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了Omni-RAG框架，通过改进查询理解和处理，提高了生成增强检索系统（RAG）在处理现实复杂查询时的鲁棒性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前RAG系统在处理用户噪声复杂查询（如多意图、模糊查询）时的低效问题，加强其在现实场景的适用性。

Method: 引入Omni-RAG框架，通过三个模块实现改进：（1）深度查询理解与分解——基于LLM纠错及分解多意图查询；（2）意图感知知识检索——为子查询检索跨域知识并汇总结果；（3）重排与生成——利用重排器优化文档选择，并借助链式提示的LLM生成最终响应。

Result: Omni-RAG展示了在处理噪声复杂查询上的优异性能，并成功应对如SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG挑战等开放域场景需求。

Conclusion: Omni-RAG显著提升了RAG系统在开放领域复杂应用场景中的实用性，通过其鲁棒和有效的设计，更好响应用户的多样化查询需求。

Abstract: Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant
challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and
contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with
external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex
inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper
introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and
effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs
LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key
modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs
with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and
decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware
Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus
(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking
and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before
a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a
chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG
capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those
highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex
and noisy queries.

*Ali Şenol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个增强领域知识的LLM框架，用于检测假话与概念漂移，通过集成大型语言模型与任务特定的结构化信息来实现高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态平台上因语言模式演变与概念漂移导致的欺骗性对话难检测问题，同时克服LLM在上下文歧义性与高风险情境应用中的局限性。

Method: 提出一个三模块框架：(1)DK-LLM用于检测假对话；(2)OCDD漂移检测单元以识别语义漂移；(3)另一个DK-LLM分类漂移为良性或欺诈性。

Result: 通过在假评论数据集和多轮对话数据集SEConvo上实验，框架表现出高精准性能，LLaMA实现分类精度达98%，并比零样本基线显著提升。

Conclusion: 整合领域知识与漂移检测显著增强了模型在高风险NLP应用中的表现、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting deceptive conversations on dynamic platforms is increasingly
difficult due to evolving language patterns and Concept Drift (CD)\-i.e.,
semantic or topical shifts that alter the context or intent of interactions
over time. These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,
making accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with
contextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk\-sensitive scenarios. To
address these challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)\-Enhanced LLM
framework that integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task\-specific
insights to perform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed
architecture consists of three main components: (1) a DK\-LLM module to detect
fake or deceptive conversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine
whether a semantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK\-LLM module to
classify the drift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value
of domain knowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full
framework to SEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types
of fraud and spam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake
conversations with high accuracy and effectively classifies the nature of
drift. Guided by structured prompts, the LLaMA\-based implementation achieves
98\% classification accuracy. Comparative studies against zero\-shot baselines
demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge and drift awareness
significantly improves performance, interpretability, and robustness in
high\-stakes NLP applications.

*Makbule Gulcin Ozsoy,William Tai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型在文本到Cypher查询任务中多语言表现。研究创造并发布了一个多语言测试集，发现模型在不同语言上的表现差异显著，英语表现最佳，而土耳其语最低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于英语语言的数据库查询接口，而缺乏对多语言用户的支持，需要研究大语言模型在多语言场景下的表现。

Method: 创建多语言测试集，通过翻译问题句至西班牙语和土耳其语同时保留原始Cypher查询；对多种基础模型进行标准化的输入提示和指标评估；分析翻译提示语对文本生成任务的影响。

Result: 模型在英语、西班牙语和土耳其语上的性能呈现显著下降趋势；翻译任务提示对评估指标的影响最小。

Conclusion: 强调开发多语言查询的多样性需求，未来工作包括多语言的模式调优以及数据库模式的本土化。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled natural language
interfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as
Text2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database
accessibility, most research today focuses solely on English, with limited
evaluation in other languages. This paper investigates the performance of
foundational LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple languages. We create
and release a multilingual test set by translating English questions into
Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher queries, enabling fair
cross-lingual comparison. We evaluate multiple foundational models using
standardized prompts and metrics. Our results show a consistent performance
pattern: highest on English, then Spanish, and lowest on Turkish. We attribute
this to differences in training data availability and linguistic
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the impact of translating task
prompts into Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in
evaluation metrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Our
findings highlight the need for more inclusive evaluation and development in
multilingual query generation. Future work includes schema localization and
fine-tuning across diverse languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过用户交互改善实时语音对话模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要关注文本语言模型，未能适应实时语音交互的复杂性，如插话和多轮对话无明确分段。

Method: 创建超过15万对标注的偏好数据集，结合离线对齐方法，微调全双工自回归语音到语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，此方法在提高对话模型的真实性、安全性和上下文对齐性方面有效。

Conclusion: 研究表明，多样化动态的平衡对自然实时语音对话系统至关重要。

Abstract: We propose a novel preference alignment framework for improving spoken
dialogue models on real-time conversations from user interactions. Current
preference learning methods primarily focus on text-based language models, and
are not directly suited to the complexities of real-time speech interactions,
with richer dynamics (e.g. interruption, interjection) and no explicit
segmentation between speaker turns.We create a large-scale dataset of more than
150,000 preference pairs from raw multi-turn speech conversations, annotated
with AI feedback, to cover preferences over both linguistic content and
temporal context variations. We leverage offline alignment methods to finetune
a full-duplex autoregressive speech-to-speech model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that feedback on generic conversations can be consistently
effective in improving spoken dialogue models to produce more factual, safer
and more contextually aligned interactions. We deploy the finetuned model and
conduct holistic human evaluations to assess the impact beyond single-turn
conversations. Our findings shed light on the importance of a well-calibrated
balance among various dynamics, crucial for natural real-time speech dialogue
systems.

### [146] [TopK Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21468)
*Ryosuke Takahashi,Tatsuro Inaba,Kentaro Inui,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在变压器架构中引入TopK激活函数的方法，使语言模型（LMs）的隐藏状态对应于稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）的潜在特征，从而解决了SAEs的若干局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs在分析和解释基于变压器的语言模型的激活空间中很重要，但由于其后处理训练方式存在概念发现不完整和特征不稳定等问题，影响其有效性和可靠性。

Method: 修改变压器架构，在特定层加入TopK激活功能，使模型隐藏状态等效于稀疏自动编码器的潜在特征，取消后处理训练需求，同时保留解释性。

Result: 实验表明，使用TopK方法的LMs具备有效解释性，提升了对神经元形成过程的分析能力，并能通过特定神经元干预实现模型操控。

Conclusion: TopK LMs在维持原始功能的同时，提供了更高的稳定性和可靠性，为模型的可解释性和可控性研究提供了强有力的支持，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and
interpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).
However, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and
internal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the
failure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due
to the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated
by training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE
learns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of
feature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across
different checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a
modification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK
activation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states
equivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the
need for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.
The resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,
computational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple
architectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while
providing robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that
the sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering
through targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of
neuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make
TopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn
and represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future
research on model interpretability and controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在从离线到半在线再到全在线模式过渡中，优化语言模型性能，并探索可验证和不可验证任务的适用性。

Method: 通过训练语言模型处理可验证的数学任务和不可验证的任务指令。比较线下、半线上和线上两种优化目标，分析训练动态和超参数选择，并探讨多任务训练的优势。

Result: 半在线和全在线的优化方法性能相近，且均显著优于离线方法。此外，多任务训练提升了两类任务的整体表现。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在半在线和全在线模式下的表现优越，多任务训练能带来显著增益。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for
finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online
to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our
experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable
instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across
these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference
Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly
find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all
strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the
training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal
results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable
rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

TL;DR: 通过优化对话后的用户反应信号，提升互动大语言模型的用户参与度，以为社交型对话提供更高水平的用户互动支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管早期研究尝试优化知识推理和对话行为规划，但这些方法与用户参与度的关系并不明确。本研究旨在增强社交型对话中用户的参与度。

Method: 采用用户对对话意图的反应作为参与度指标，并通过用户模拟器和交互型MCTS收集高低质量体验数据，再利用直接偏好优化方法调整模型。

Result: 在情感支持对话和劝说对话场景中，实验验证了所提方法能有效提升用户参与度。

Conclusion: 通过未来对话发展信号的利用和直接偏好优化方法，该研究成功提升了交互型LLMs的用户参与度，为改进社交型对话质量提供了新方法。

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through interactions plays an essential role in
socially-driven dialogues. While prior works have optimized models to reason
over relevant knowledge or plan a dialogue act flow, the relationship between
user engagement and knowledge or dialogue acts is subtle and does not guarantee
user engagement in socially-driven dialogues. To this end, we enable
interactive LLMs to learn user engagement by leveraging signals from the future
development of conversations. Specifically, we adopt a more direct and relevant
indicator of user engagement, i.e., the user's reaction related to dialogue
intention after the interaction, as a reward to align interactive LLMs. To
achieve this, we develop a user simulator to interact with target interactive
LLMs and explore interactions between the user and the interactive LLM system
via \textit{i$\times$MCTS} (\textit{M}onte \textit{C}arlo \textit{T}ree
\textit{S}earch for \textit{i}nteraction). In this way, we collect a dataset
containing pairs of higher and lower-quality experiences using
\textit{i$\times$MCTS}, and align interactive LLMs for high-level user
engagement by direct preference optimization (DPO) accordingly. Experiments
conducted on two socially-driven dialogue scenarios (emotional support
conversations and persuasion for good) demonstrate that our method effectively
enhances user engagement in interactive LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在基准测试中的表现是否能够真正反映其理解能力，以及其测试结果是否仅是表面上的正确性。

Method: 引入正式框架来分析LLMs的测试有效性，设计了两种检测模型伪理解的方法：一个专门设计的基准测试，以及提供伪理解下界的一般性过程。

Result: 研究发现伪理解现象广泛存在于各种模型、任务和领域中，并且反映了概念表征上的深层内部矛盾。

Conclusion: 基准测试可能未能全面评估LLMs的真正能力，其成功可能是伪理解的体现，这对模型能力的评估提出了挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark
datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities
based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces
a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the
benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test
people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid
tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human
misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin
understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable
with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for
quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed
benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a
lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across
models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just
incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept
representations.

Abstract: People are increasingly seeking healthcare information from large language
models (LLMs) via interactive chatbots, yet the nature and inherent risks of
these conversations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we filter
large-scale conversational AI datasets to achieve HealthChat-11K, a curated
dataset of 11K real-world conversations composed of 25K user messages. We use
HealthChat-11K and a clinician-driven taxonomy for how users interact with LLMs
when seeking healthcare information in order to systematically study user
interactions across 21 distinct health specialties. Our analysis reveals
insights into the nature of how and why users seek health information, such as
common interactions, instances of incomplete context, affective behaviors, and
interactions (e.g., leading questions) that can induce sycophancy, underscoring
the need for improvements in the healthcare support capabilities of LLMs
deployed as conversational AI. Code and artifacts to retrieve our analyses and

TL;DR: 作者提出了一种新的数据组织方法，称为数据效能（Data Efficacy），并通过DELT框架验证其在语言模型训练中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究主要聚焦于通过数据效率优化训练数据子集，忽略了如何优化数据组织以提高模型性能的潜力。

Method: 引入DELT框架，包括数据评分、数据选择和数据排序三个模块。其中，提出了Learnability-Quality Scoring（LQS）用于数据评分，以及Folding Ordering（FO）用于改进数据排序。

Result: 实验结果表明，DELT框架的不同实例均能在不增加数据规模和模型大小的情况下提升语言模型性能，特别是LQS与FO的结合效果最佳。此外，数据效能与数据效率可以共同实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是一个值得深入探索的方向，可显著提高语言模型的训练效果和性能优化。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

TL;DR: 本研究评估基于LLM的代理在多代理协作场景中的隐私保护能力，结果显示当前模型在理解和执行上下文隐私保护方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基于LLM的多代理系统在隐私关键的多轮对话场景中能否有效保障用户隐私。

Method: 提出一个名为MAGPIE的基准测试，将158个涉及高隐私敏感度的真实场景应用于多代理对话中，评估模型对上下文隐私的理解和协作能力。

Result: 当前最先进的模型（例如GPT-4o与Claude-2.7-Sonnet）在识别上下文隐私和任务协作中频繁出错，如43.6%的情况下错误分类隐私数据，50%以上的对话中泄露隐私，且71%的场景下任务无法完成。

Conclusion: 当前基于LLM的代理在隐私保护和协同任务解决方面表现不足，需要进一步对上下文隐私和协作能力进行改进。

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户难以为领域专用应用创建高质量提示的问题。

Method: 结合上下文查询分析、检索增强的知识基础、分层技能组织和自适应技能排名生成相关提示建议，并使用两阶段的分层推理过程和少样本学习增强预定义模板。

Result: 实验证明该方法在实际数据集上具有高度实用性和相关性，得到了自动化和专家评估的验证。

Conclusion: 系统有效改进了提示的相关性和实用性，为领域专用AI应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型对高风险社会决策的影响增加，理解其建议的宏观长期影响变得至关重要，以确保其带来益处。

Method: 设计了一种框架，预测语言模型生成的建议如何在社会系统中传播，并引入包含100个间接损害场景的数据集，测试模型识别非显而易见不良后果的能力。

Result: 所提出的方法在新数据集上取得了超过20%的性能提升，并在现有安全基准中拥有超过70%的胜率表现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种构建更安全语言模型的有前景方向，通过考虑长期社会影响和非直接损害场景，提升了模型的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

TL;DR: 文章探讨大语言模型（LLMs）的因果推理能力，发现现有模型仅能实现浅层次的因果推理（第一级推理），并提出一种新方法G^2-Reasoner以提升其推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在因果推理中表现出一定能力，但无法实现类似于人类的深入（第二级）因果推理。因此本研究旨在分析这种局限性并探索改进方法。

Method: 研究通过分析变压器架构的自回归机制，说明其非天然因果特性；引入新的因果问答基准CausalProbe-2024以检测模型性能；设计了G^2-Reasoner方法，通过结合通用知识和目标导向提示提升推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在CausalProbe-2024基准测试上表现下滑，验证其仅具有一级因果推理能力；而G^2-Reasoner方法有效提高了模型在新颖和反事实环境下的因果推理性能。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示LLMs当前因果推理能力的不足，并提出G^2-Reasoner方法，为实现接近人类的因果推理能力提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大的视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）在熟悉环境的任务中表现不错，但对陌生环境和多步骤目标任务表现较差。本文提出了一种新的框架，WAP，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LVLMs在复杂情境中的表现不佳，特别是对长远计划与陌生环境的适应能力不足，因此需要增强模型的环境理解能力。

Method: 提出WAP框架，通过可视化外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和语法对齐四种认知能力，加强模型对环境的感知，同时引入课程学习方法，仅使用原始视觉观测来开发和评估模型。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试中，Qwen2.5-VL在任务成功率、常识推理以及长远规划方面分别提升了60.7、60.0和70.0个百分点。同时，改进后的开源模型显著超过了GPT-4o及Claude-3.5-Sonnet等专有系统。

Conclusion: 通过引入WAP框架，LVLMs在复杂任务中的表现得以显著提升，尤其是在涉及环境感知与多步骤规划的任务上。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

Conclusion: 通过将可解释AI方法、交互性与实际应用相结合，本研究为AI解释实践和人机交互提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 人工智能在科学发现领域具有巨大的潜力，但目前系统在架构、推理和现实实验结合上存在不足，未来的发展需要填补抽象、推理和现实之间的三个基本差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能的发展带来了对科学发现的期望，但现有系统的局限性阻碍了进一步突破。

Method: 提出了一种科学发现的主动推断AI系统，其核心包括基于因果自监督模型的长期记忆、具备贝叶斯机制的规划器、发展持续更新的知识图谱，并通过闭环系统与高拟真模拟和自动实验室实时交互。

Result: 通过内部模型的反事实推理与外部实验验证的结合，能够实现更有效的发现过程。

Conclusion: 人工智能在科学发现中的关键在于与实验现实的结合与闭环校正，同时人类判断不可替代，应成为永久的架构组成部分。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

TL;DR: TableMoE是一种专为复杂多模态表格数据理解设计的神经符号模型，能有效处理WildStruct条件，并显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态表格数据复杂结构和视觉退化条件下，现有方法表现不佳，亟需更强的模型进行准确表格理解。

Method: 引入神经符号的混合专家机制Neuro-Symbolic Routing，基于符号推理动态分配不同专家处理表格元素；并构建大规模的TableMoE-Align数据集用于对齐预训练。

Result: 实验表明，TableMoE在挑战性WildStruct基准数据集上优于现有模型，并通过消融实验验证了Neuro-Symbolic Routing的重要性。

Conclusion: TableMoE通过将神经符号推理整合进多模态表格理解，不仅提升了模型性能，还增强了其解释性与鲁棒性，为复杂现实情境下多模态表格理解提供了全新方案。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨现有视觉语言模型是否能够像人类一样从少量视角中推理出完整场景，解决模型在空间心理建模中的表现缺陷。

Method: 提出MindCube基准测试，用21,154个问题评估模型在认知映射、视角转换和动态推断方面的表现，并探索结合未见视图、中间推理链及认知图的“map-then-reason”训练方法。同时引入强化学习进一步提升性能。

Result: “map-then-reason”方法显著提升了模型性能，准确率从37.8%升至60.8%，加上强化学习后进一步提升到70.7%。

Conclusion: 通过构建和利用内在结构化空间表示及灵活推理过程的支架，能够显著提升VLMs对不可观测空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Conclusion: 该研究减少了人类评估的成本与难度，推动了更高效的数据使用与人机协作方法的开发。

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

Result: 评估了九个前沿搜索系统和人类表现，发现最好表现的系统已达到人类表现的50-70%，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为开发和评测下一代基于代理的搜索系统提供了坚实的基础。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

Conclusion: PsyLite为资源受限环境中的心理咨询应用提供了一种可行的高效方案，解决了对话安全、场景处理及轻量化的问题。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决现有联邦学习方法中对数据集大小特性重视不足的问题，改善异构数据情境下的学习性能。

Method: 引入大小自适应联邦学习框架(SAFL)，通过渐进训练和优化数据集的大小特性，提高不同模态下的学习表现。

Result: 发现最佳数据集大小范围为1000-1500，结构化数据优于非结构化数据，大于2000的数据会造成性能下降。SAFL平均精度达87.68%，多模态精度超99%，且显著减少通信量。

Conclusion: SAFL框架显著提升了联邦学习性能，同时提供了数据特性优化的理论和实践指导，适用于神经网络和学习系统的真实部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for
distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, existing
approaches predominantly focus on model heterogeneity and aggregation
techniques, largely overlooking the fundamental impact of dataset size
characteristics on federated training dynamics. This paper introduces
Size-Based Adaptive Federated Learning (SAFL), a novel progressive training
framework that systematically organizes federated learning based on dataset
size characteristics across heterogeneous multi-modal data. Our comprehensive
experimental evaluation across 13 diverse datasets spanning 7 modalities
(vision, text, time series, audio, sensor, medical vision, and multimodal)
reveals critical insights: 1) an optimal dataset size range of 1000-1500
samples for federated learning effectiveness; 2) a clear modality performance
hierarchy with structured data (time series, sensor) significantly
outperforming unstructured data (text, multimodal); and 3) systematic
performance degradation for large datasets exceeding 2000 samples. SAFL
achieves an average accuracy of 87.68% across all datasets, with structured
data modalities reaching 99%+ accuracy. The framework demonstrates superior
communication efficiency, reducing total data transfer to 7.38 GB across 558
communications while maintaining high performance. Our real-time monitoring
framework provides unprecedented insights into system resource utilization,
network efficiency, and training dynamics. This work fills critical gaps in
understanding how data characteristics should drive federated learning
strategies, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for
real-world FL deployments in neural network and learning systems.

Conclusion: E-ABIN是一个通用且可解释的生物网络异常检测框架，不仅准确性高，还提供了用户友好的操作界面。

Abstract: The increasing availability of large-scale omics data calls for robust
analytical frameworks capable of handling complex gene expression datasets
while offering interpretable results. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence have enabled the identification of aberrant molecular patterns
distinguishing disease states from healthy controls. Coupled with improvements
in model interpretability, these tools now support the identification of genes
potentially driving disease phenotypes. However, current approaches to gene
anomaly detection often remain limited to single datasets and lack accessible
graphical interfaces. Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable
framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines
classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a
unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of
anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating
algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders
(GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a
high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the
utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease,
where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers
insights into disease mechanisms.

Conclusion: CCUP为理解大脑和机器如何通过递归结构与特异性对齐来最小化不确定性提供了统一的理论基础，强调大脑作为熵梯度解析器的功能。

Abstract: The Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP) proposes that inference
under uncertainty is governed by an entropy asymmetry between context and
content: high-entropy contexts must be interpreted through alignment with
low-entropy, structured content. In this paper, we develop a layered
computational framework that derives operational principles from this
foundational asymmetry. At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as
directional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that
favors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four
hierarchical layers of operational principles: (\textbf{L1}) \emph{Core
Inference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric
inference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,
all shown to be mutually reducible; (\textbf{L2}) \emph{Resource Allocation
Principles}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,
and attractor-based memory encoding; (\textbf{L3}) \emph{Temporal Bootstrapping
Dynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;
and (\textbf{L4}) \emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates
these mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and
planning. We present formal equivalence theorems, a dependency lattice among
principles, and computational simulations demonstrating the efficiency gains of
CCUP-aligned inference. This work provides a unified theoretical foundation for
understanding how brains and machines minimize uncertainty through recursive
structure-specificity alignment. The brain is not just an inference machine. It
is a cycle-consistent entropy gradient resolver, aligning structure and
specificity via path-dependent, content-seeded simulation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS)的推理时间对齐方法，通过将扩散模型的推理转化为搜索问题以改进生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在推理中适应新目标存在问题，如引导偏差和计算效率低下，该研究期望通过搜索机制解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将推理时间的对齐建模为搜索问题，并利用树搜索（类似蒙特卡洛树搜索），该方法传播终端奖励到扩散链中，并通过迭代优化值估计生成高质量样本。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上，DTS在计算量减少10倍的情况下达到最优FID，文本到图像和语言生成任务中，DTS有效实现了最优样本搜索，计算量减少5倍。

Conclusion: 通过重复利用以前的计算信息，DTS提供了一种高效且可扩展的推理时间扩散模型对齐方法，性能与额外计算正相关。

Abstract: Adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new objectives at inference time
remains an open problem in generative modeling. Existing steering methods
suffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which
biases guidance. Moreover, information from past runs is not reused to improve
sample quality, resulting in inefficient use of compute. Inspired by the
success of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting
inference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We
introduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target
density by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and
iteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our
proposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact
samples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its
greedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\star$), performs a global search
for high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,
DTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\times$ less
compute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\star$
effectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to
$5\times$ less compute. By reusing information from previous generations, we
get an anytime algorithm that turns additional compute into steadily better
samples, providing a scalable approach for inference-time alignment of
diffusion models.

Motivation: 扩散模型被认为能够学习低维支撑的分布，论文旨在探讨DM如何隐式学习数据的局部内在维度（LID），以进一步应用于复杂性量化及异常检测。

Method: 研究通过证明FLIPD在现实假设下的正确性来完善其理论基础，同时探讨用均匀卷积替代高斯卷积的可能性。

Result: 证明了FLIPD的正确性在非理想假设下同样成立，并拓展了其应用形式到均匀卷积场景。

Conclusion: FLIPD在LID估计方面具有稳固的理论支持，可为数据复杂性分析与异常检测等领域提供更可靠的工具。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional
ambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional
submanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with
progressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this
process -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,
and are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.
For a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively
expect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic
dimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari
et al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID
to the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to
the amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID
estimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify
the complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,
adversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art
performance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete
since Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly
unrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap
by formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.
Additionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions
are replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex

comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced

AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are catalyzing a transformative shift in materials
science (MatSci) by enabling scalable, general-purpose, and multimodal AI
systems for scientific discovery. Unlike traditional machine learning models,
which are typically narrow in scope and require task-specific engineering, FMs
offer cross-domain generalization and exhibit emergent capabilities. Their
versatility is especially well-suited to materials science, where research
challenges span diverse data types and scales. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of foundation models, agentic systems, datasets, and
computational tools supporting this growing field. We introduce a task-driven
taxonomy encompassing six broad application areas: data extraction,
interpretation and Q\&A; atomistic simulation; property prediction; materials
structure, design and discovery; process planning, discovery, and optimization;
and multiscale modeling. We discuss recent advances in both unimodal and
multimodal FMs, as well as emerging large language model (LLM) agents.
Furthermore, we review standardized datasets, open-source tools, and autonomous
experimental platforms that collectively fuel the development and integration
of FMs into research workflows. We assess the early successes of foundation
models and identify persistent limitations, including challenges in
generalizability, interpretability, data imbalance, safety concerns, and
limited multimodal fusion. Finally, we articulate future research directions
centered on scalable pretraining, continual learning, data governance, and
trustworthiness.

Method: 提出动态权重嫁接方法，在微调与预训练模型之间进行分析，分离模型提取和回忆路径，探讨其必要性和充分性。

Result: 发现LLM在微调中，既处理实体时提取关系信息，又在生成预测时回忆信息；并分析了信息路径的层次位置、冗余性及相关模型组件。

Conclusion: 微调后的模型需要同时利用提取和回忆路径来生成正确的预测，两种路径的重要性因情况而异，强调了任务特定的注意机制和模型最终层的关系提取步骤。

Abstract: When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases,
corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when
the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or
are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g.
activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to
replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill
this gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained
language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract
relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and
(2) ``recall" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In
some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned
information while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment" or ``recall" pathway
alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these
information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy
they exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the
``recall" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a
relation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward
networks at the final layers before next token prediction.

Motivation: 随着模型的扩展以及算法和数据的更新，语言模型的训练成本极高，推动了对低精度计算格式的研究。在此背景下，MX格式的设计用于提升训练效率，但其稳定性尚未解决。

Method: 研究中通过广泛的实验，结合不同的训练配置和精度格式分析了MX格式的训练稳定性，并提出了一种基于量化导致的梯度偏差的解释模型，同时尝试在训练中引入精度方案的动态调整。

Result: 作者发现MX格式容易导致训练中随机的不稳定，尤其在较大计算规模下。通过调整精度方案和结合混合精度策略，可以明显改善性能并接近全精度训练效果。

Conclusion: 虽然MX格式在语言模型训练中存在不稳定性，但通过适当的策略调整，可以在保留性能的同时实现高效的低精度训练。

Abstract: Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that
must be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is
collected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly
support lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)
formats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a
shared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and
perform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency
gains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of
block-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one
thousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from
$2 \times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad
range of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe
that training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the
loss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we
conduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that
exhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural
settings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a
simple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the
quantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of
activations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \emph{in situ} intervention
experiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be
averted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these
findings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that
certain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with
full-precision training. We release our code at
https://github.com/Hither1/systems-scaling.

Abstract: We propose a latent score-based generative AI framework for learning
stochastic, non-local closure models and constitutive laws in nonlinear
dynamical systems of computational mechanics. This work addresses a key
challenge of modeling complex multiscale dynamical systems without a clear
scale separation, for which numerically resolving all scales is prohibitively
expensive, e.g., for engineering turbulent flows. While classical closure
modeling methods leverage domain knowledge to approximate subgrid-scale
phenomena, their deterministic and local assumptions can be too restrictive in
regimes lacking a clear scale separation. Recent developments of
diffusion-based stochastic models have shown promise in the context of closure
modeling, but their prohibitive computational inference cost limits practical
applications for many real-world applications. This work addresses this
limitation by jointly training convolutional autoencoders with conditional
diffusion models in the latent spaces, significantly reducing the
dimensionality of the sampling process while preserving essential physical
characteristics. Numerical results demonstrate that the joint training approach
helps discover a proper latent space that not only guarantees small
reconstruction errors but also ensures good performance of the diffusion model
in the latent space. When integrated into numerical simulations, the proposed
stochastic modeling framework via latent conditional diffusion models achieves
significant computational acceleration while maintaining comparable predictive
accuracy to standard diffusion models in physical spaces.

Conclusion: 通过对SPD的开发和实验验证，研究拓宽了将因果中介分析与网络分解结合的可能性，为理解复杂神经网络的机制性研究提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into
simpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter
decomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues
with current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into
a sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main
method in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is
impractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to
hyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \textit{Stochastic Parameter
Decomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to
hyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are
slightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We
also show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned
parameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By
bridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this
demonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic
interpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition
methods to larger models. We release a library for running SPD and reproducing
our experiments at https://github.com/goodfire-ai/spd.

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often
demanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative
experimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or
less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are
scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an
automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.
  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)
strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new
iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on
existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)
autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and
subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed
timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the
challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to
compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.
  Since quantitative results from an ongoing performance competition were
embargoed on paper submission date, we present the architectural design,
operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of
LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization,
especially in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving hardware environments.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, are effective for
time-series tasks like sentiment analysis and short-term stock prediction.
However, their computational complexity poses challenges for real-time
deployment in resource constrained environments. While FPGAs offer a promising
platform for energy-efficient AI acceleration, existing tools mainly target
feed-forward networks, and LSTM acceleration typically requires full custom
implementation. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the
open-source and extensible FINN framework to enable the generalized deployment
of LSTMs on FPGAs. Specifically, we leverage the Scan operator from the Open
Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) specification to model the recurrent nature of
LSTM computations, enabling support for mixed quantisation within them and
functional verification of LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we introduce custom
transformations within the FINN compiler to map the quantised ONNX computation
graph to hardware blocks from the HLS kernel library of the FINN compiler and
Vitis HLS. We validate the proposed tool-flow by training a quantised ConvLSTM
model for a mid-price stock prediction task using the widely used dataset and
generating a corresponding hardware IP of the model using our flow, targeting
the XCZU7EV device. We show that the generated quantised ConvLSTM accelerator
through our flow achieves a balance between performance (latency) and resource
consumption, while matching (or bettering) inference accuracy of
state-of-the-art models with reduced precision. We believe that the
generalisable nature of the proposed flow will pave the way for
resource-efficient RNN accelerator designs on FPGAs.

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance,
but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble
selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to
heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose
Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary
classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and
inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of
difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models
to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each
model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router
model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on
inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results
on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often
outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing
instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing
efficient and robust ensemble systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法克服了现有技术的局限性，是一种具有实际应用价值的对抗样本检测方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input
designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with
subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques
against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches
either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of
perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although
equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this
work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We
show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the
state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time
processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect
adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on
different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that
predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the
prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly
effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with
any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image,
video, and audio.

Motivation: 当前的分布式图神经网络系统主要针对节点分类任务进行优化，而在链接预测任务上的性能表现研究较少。本研究旨在填补这一空白，解决其性能退化问题。

Method: 通过分析发现，引起分布式GNN性能退化的主要原因包括图分区带来的信息丢失和负采样方式。在此基础上，本文提出SpLPG方法，通过图稀疏化缓解性能退化问题，同时降低通信成本。

Result: 实验表明，与传统方法相比，SpLPG最多可减少约80%的通信开销，并在很大程度上保持链接预测的准确性。

Conclusion: SpLPG为分布式GNN在链接预测任务中的性能优化提供了有效的解决方案，既解决了性能退化问题，也显著降低了通信成本，为相关领域的研究提供了新方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for solving graph-related
problems. Distributed GNN frameworks and systems enhance the scalability of
GNNs and accelerate model training, yet most are optimized for node
classification. Their performance on link prediction remains underexplored.
This paper demystifies distributed training of GNNs for link prediction by
investigating the issue of performance degradation when each worker trains a
GNN on its assigned partitioned subgraph without having access to the entire
graph. We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the
information loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing
negative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph
information with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction
accuracy, it incurs a high communication cost. We propose SpLPG, which
effectively leverages graph sparsification to mitigate the issue of performance
degradation at a reduced communication cost. Experiment results on several
public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpLPG, which
reduces the communication overhead by up to about 80% while mostly preserving

Conclusion: 本文成果推进了认知雷达在动态环境中高效适应与目标平衡能力的发展。

Abstract: The time allocation problem in multi-function cognitive radar systems focuses
on the trade-off between scanning for newly emerging targets and tracking the
previously detected targets. We formulate this as a multi-objective
optimization problem and employ deep reinforcement learning to find
Pareto-optimal solutions and compare deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
and soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithms. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of both algorithms in adapting to various scenarios, with SAC
showing improved stability and sample efficiency compared to DDPG. We further
employ the NSGA-II algorithm to estimate an upper bound on the Pareto front of
the considered problem. This work contributes to the development of more
efficient and adaptive cognitive radar systems capable of balancing multiple
competing objectives in dynamic environments.

Result: LoRA微调显著降低了记忆化风险，同时仍保持了较强的任务表现。

Conclusion: LoRA微调在减轻记忆化风险方面表现出色，同时能够在任务性能上与完整微调相媲美，因此具有更高的安全性。

Abstract: Memorization in large language models (LLMs) makes them vulnerable to data
extraction attacks. While pre-training memorization has been extensively
studied, fewer works have explored its impact in fine-tuning, particularly for
LoRA fine-tuning, a widely adopted parameter-efficient method.
  In this work, we re-examine memorization in fine-tuning and uncover a
surprising divergence from prior findings across different fine-tuning
strategies. Factors such as model scale and data duplication, which strongly
influence memorization in pre-training and full fine-tuning, do not follow the
same trend in LoRA fine-tuning. Using a more relaxed similarity-based
memorization metric, we demonstrate that LoRA significantly reduces
memorization risks compared to full fine-tuning, while still maintaining strong
task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) has
revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling models with unprecedented
capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing complex data. These
powerful architectures have transformed a wide range of downstream
applications, tackling tasks beyond human reach. In this paper, we introduce
Omniwise, the first end-to-end, self-supervised fine-tuning pipeline that
applies large language models (LLMs) to GPU kernel performance prediction--a
novel use case in performance profiling. Omniwise is model-agnostic and
lightweight, achieving strong results even with a small 3B-parameter model. It
can predict key performance metrics, including memory bandwidth, cache hit
rates, GFLOPs, and arithmetic intensity, directly from kernel code without the
need for code execution or profiling tools. Our approach achieves over 90% of
predictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and
MI300X architectures. In addition to the pipeline, we develop an online
inference server and a Visual Studio Code plugin that seamlessly integrate
LLM-based performance prediction into developers' workflows.

Result: 提出的新方法在先前指标中提高2.79%，在基于总变差的新指标上提高111.45%。

Conclusion: RWFT无需全量重训即可实现高效和准确的类别遗忘，效果优于现有最优方法。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Conclusion: 所提算法在保障预测覆盖率的同时，显著提高了效率和性能，可用于更复杂的多模型预测任务。

Abstract: Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a
prediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a
predetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,
multi-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and
leverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the
improved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.
A candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the
computational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with
poor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to
unnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a
subset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a
bipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then
selected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced
computational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we
demonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,
can significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets
while still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms
are proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments
on real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct
smaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal
prediction approaches.

Conclusion: 新算法不仅解决了现有方法的局限性，且其条件被证明更具现实性和一般性，同时给出了接近主结果的下界。

Abstract: We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which
presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and
non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical
perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under
single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional
complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform
mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy,
specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the
first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline
RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs,
contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve
this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration
enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a
sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not
require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we
show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage
assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy,
distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined
cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has been extensively studied in decision-making
processes and has demonstrated superior performance over conventional
approaches in various fields, including radar resource management (RRM).
However, a notable limitation of neural networks is their ``black box" nature
and recent research work has increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI)
techniques to describe the rationale behind neural network decisions. One
promising XAI method is local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME).
However, the sampling process in LIME ignores the correlations between
features. In this paper, we propose a modified LIME approach that integrates
deep learning (DL) into the sampling process, which we refer to as DL-LIME. We
employ DL-LIME within deep reinforcement learning for radar resource
management. Numerical results show that DL-LIME outperforms conventional LIME
in terms of both fidelity and task performance, demonstrating superior
performance with both metrics. DL-LIME also provides insights on which factors
are more important in decision making for radar resource management.

Abstract: Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.

Conclusion: 通过引入新的逻辑命题形式和优化方法，作者实现了高效并可解释的预测模型，为结构简单、性能优异的规则集设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction
models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on
conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input
variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel
polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of
interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the
gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of
expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of
axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such
features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and
complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the
model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical
propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables,
i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where
$\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as
general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using
sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation
of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as
state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across
ten benchmark datasets.

Result: 实验表明，MSA算法在多项基准测试、模型和评估指标中均优于现有的遗忘算法方法。

Conclusion: MSA算法能够以低计算成本实现灵活的大型语言模型数据擦除，为模型的精确数据控制提供了可能性。

Abstract: Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may
include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data
that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic
datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model
on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally
prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to
eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving
the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and
undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In
this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the
influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts
capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine
unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation
metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more
flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

Conclusion: AbMEGD建立了抗体序列结构协同设计和亲和力优化的新基准，显著提升了复杂抗原的设计能力，同时保持了结构完整性。

Abstract: Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance
across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients
through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained,
inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has
explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often
rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO)
optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO)
approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM
fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a
two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally
explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization,
followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire
optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and
extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly
improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over
state-of-the-art forward-only methods.

Abstract: Explicit density learners are becoming an increasingly popular technique for
generative models because of their ability to better model probability
distributions. They have advantages over Generative Adversarial Networks due to
their ability to perform density estimation and having exact latent-variable
inference. This has many advantages, including: being able to simply
interpolate, calculate sample likelihood, and analyze the probability
distribution. The downside of these models is that they are often more
difficult to train and have lower sampling quality.
  Normalizing flows are explicit density models, that use composable bijective
functions to turn an intractable probability function into a tractable one. In
this work, we present novel knowledge distillation techniques to increase
sampling quality and density estimation of smaller student normalizing flows.
We seek to study the capacity of knowledge distillation in Compositional
Normalizing Flows to understand the benefits and weaknesses provided by these
architectures. Normalizing flows have unique properties that allow for a
non-traditional forms of knowledge transfer, where we can transfer that
knowledge within intermediate layers. We find that through this distillation,
we can make students significantly smaller while making substantial performance
gains over a non-distilled student. With smaller models there is a
proportionally increased throughput as this is dependent upon the number of
bijectors, and thus parameters, in the network.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction aims to learn representations that map chemical
structures to functional properties. While multimodal learning has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to learn molecular representations, prior works have largely
overlooked textual and taxonomic information of molecules for representation
learning. We introduce TRIDENT, a novel framework that integrates molecular
SMILES, textual descriptions, and taxonomic functional annotations to learn
rich molecular representations. To achieve this, we curate a comprehensive
dataset of molecule-text pairs with structured, multi-level functional
annotations. Instead of relying on conventional contrastive loss, TRIDENT
employs a volume-based alignment objective to jointly align tri-modal features
at the global level, enabling soft, geometry-aware alignment across modalities.
Additionally, TRIDENT introduces a novel local alignment objective that
captures detailed relationships between molecular substructures and their
corresponding sub-textual descriptions. A momentum-based mechanism dynamically
balances global and local alignment, enabling the model to learn both broad
functional semantics and fine-grained structure-function mappings. TRIDENT
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 downstream tasks, demonstrating the
value of combining SMILES, textual, and taxonomic functional annotations for
molecular property prediction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法MoRA，用于克服在持续学习中大模型的遗忘和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LoRA的MoE方法存在干扰、冗余和路由模糊等问题。

Method: 提出MoRA方法，通过将rank-r更新分解为r个rank-1组件，并以自激活方式选择稀疏的rank组合以减轻干扰和冗余，同时利用激活来避免路由模糊。

Result: 在持续学习任务中，MoRA方法提高了大模型的迁移学习能力，并缓解了遗忘问题，同时增强了模型的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MoRA证明了其在提高持续学习性能方面的有效性，尤其是在减少遗忘和改进迁移泛化上的优势。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) with large pre-trained models is challenged by
catastrophic forgetting and task interference. Existing LoRA-based
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and
freezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and
ambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design
introduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts
per input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful
components across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or
contradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks
and insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features
across tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As
more experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating
forgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with
self-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple
low-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,
each treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1
expert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid
ambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own
relevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning
and activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per
input. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large
language models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain
forgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant
effectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while
mitigating forgetting.

Abstract: Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RL-Selector方法，通过强化学习动态优化数据选择策略，减少冗余数据并提升训练效率及模型泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习依赖大规模数据集，但训练这些数据集计算和存储开销较高，同时数据集中含有冗余样本，因此需要更加高效的数据训练机制。

Method: 提出epsilon-sample cover来量化样本冗余性，以数据间关系构建数据内在结构，并将数据选择问题重新表达为一个强化学习过程，通过RL-Selector方法动态调整数据选择策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和不同架构上进行实验，该方法优于现有最先进的基线方法，所选择的数据集在提高训练效率的同时还能增强模型的泛化性能。

Conclusion: RL-Selector实现了训练效率与模型性能的双重提升，是一种有效的数据选择新方法。

Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on
these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world
datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more
data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate
redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing
training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically
rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined
effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We
introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample
redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic
structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a
reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a
lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging
epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward
signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse
architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show
enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

Motivation: 长时域目标任务面临次级目标不可行性和计划效率低的问题。

Method: SSE框架通过约束高层决策实现次级目标的单步可达性，同时引入分离的探索策略和失败感知的路径优化机制。

Result: 实验表明SSE在多个长时域基准任务上，无论效率还是成功率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSE框架有效解决了长时域目标条件任务中存在的探索与执行难题，表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards
are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions,
they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We
introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL
framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally
constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a
decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored
regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which
refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to
observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability.
Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that
SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL
approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督技能发现方法在提高探索能力上表现出色，但在高维度环境中效率仍不足。本研究旨在解决这种效率受限的问题，尤其是在高维环境下。

Method: 通过将技能发现建模为技能生成和策略学习之间的对抗过程，利用策略学习的后悔值来指导技能发现，并引入可升级的技能生成器群体避免退化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在效率和多样性上优于现有基线方法，且在高维环境下实现了15%的零次学习提升。

Conclusion: 新方法有效地在提升效率和多样性的同时，克服了传统方法在高维环境下的局限性，为无监督技能发现提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery aims to learn diverse and distinguishable
behaviors in open-ended reinforcement learning. For existing methods, they
focus on improving diversity through pure exploration, mutual information
optimization, and learning temporal representation. Despite that they perform
well on exploration, they remain limited in terms of efficiency, especially for
the high-dimensional situations. In this work, we frame skill discovery as a
min-max game of skill generation and policy learning, proposing a regret-aware
method on top of temporal representation learning that expands the discovered
skill space along the direction of upgradable policy strength. The key insight
behind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the
policy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored
while less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an
implementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and
guide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid
degeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill
generators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities
and dimension sizes. Empirical results show that our method outperforms
baselines in both efficiency and diversity. Moreover, our method achieves a 15%
zero shot improvement in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决FL中数据因时间和空间异质性引发的概念漂移问题，以及现有方法在处理虚拟或标签漂移时的不足。

Method: FedDAA框架包括三个模块：1. 聚类数量确定模块；2. 真实漂移检测模块；3. 概念漂移适应模块，并结合理论收敛保证。

Result: FedDAA在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集的精度提高了7.84%到8.52%。

Conclusion: FedDAA能够区分并适应多源概念漂移，同时有效保留有用的历史知识，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change
over time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as
concept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift
(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the
input distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution
P(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily
focus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these
methods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading
to catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different
sources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift
calls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from
retaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a
general adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To
address this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework
designed to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable
historical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster
number determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real
drift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and
a concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful
historical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and
experiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Result: 实验表明，使用少量合成数据的微调能够显著提升大语言模型的工具使用和整体能力。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱生成的指令数据是一种有效提升大语言模型能力的新方法。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to use tools is crucial for improving
their problem-solving abilities and expanding their applications. However,
effectively using tools is challenging because it requires a deep understanding
of tool functionalities and user intentions. Previous methods relied mainly on
LLMs to generate instruction data, but the quality of these data was often
insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses knowledge graphs
to generate high-quality instruction data for LLMs. Knowledge graphs are
manually curated datasets rich in semantic information. We begin by extracting
various query pathways from a given knowledge graph, which are transformed into
a broad spectrum of user queries. We then translate the relationships between
entities into actionable tools and parse the pathways of each query into
detailed solution steps, thereby creating high-quality instruction data. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning on just a small sample of this synthetic data
can significantly improve the tool utilization and overall capabilities of
LLMs.

Motivation: 探索在无线通信中如何通过更轻量化的Transformer模型实现高效且高性能的符号检测，解决传统深层Transformer高储存和计算成本的问题。

Method: 设计了一种名为CHOOSE的浅层Transformer框架，通过在隐藏空间引入自回归推理步骤，以增强浅层模型（仅用1-2层）的推理能力，同时避免增加模型深度。

Conclusion: CHOOSE为在资源受限的移动设备上部署基于Transformer的无线通信算法提供了一种有效方案。

Abstract: Transformers have shown potential in solving wireless communication problems,
particularly via in-context learning (ICL), where models adapt to new tasks
through prompts without requiring model updates. However, prior ICL-based
Transformer models rely on deep architectures with many layers to achieve
satisfactory performance, resulting in substantial storage and computational
costs. In this work, we propose CHain Of thOught Symbol dEtection (CHOOSE), a
CoT-enhanced shallow Transformer framework for wireless symbol detection. By
introducing autoregressive latent reasoning steps within the hidden space,
CHOOSE significantly improves the reasoning capacity of shallow models (1-2
layers) without increasing model depth. This design enables lightweight
Transformers to achieve detection performance comparable to much deeper models,
making them well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional
shallow Transformers and achieves performance comparable to that of deep
Transformers, while maintaining storage and computational efficiency. This
represents a promising direction for implementing Transformer-based algorithms
in wireless receivers with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: 通过提升公平性研究的基准测试能力，该工作为解决联邦学习中的公平性问题提供了新的技术支持和方法思路。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key
concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated
system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that
are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing
solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a
single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and
sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited
perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the
different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in
FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at
both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways:
(1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to
evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four
bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness
mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use
functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Motivation: 当前的CBM模型仅在任务预测上提供可解释性，而其概念预测部分仍然是黑箱模型，限制了模型的信任与应用。

Method: 引入了H-CMR模型，该模型通过学习有向无环图建立概念之间的逻辑关系，并通过注意力机制选择规则，层次性地预测概念和最终任务。

Result: 实验表明，H-CMR在提供可解释性的同时，性能可以达到最先进水平，并且支持更强的人机交互性和提高数据效率。

Conclusion: H-CMR为概念和任务预测提供了解释性，并通过人机交互和背景知识的利用提升准确性和效率，是当前CBM方法的一个重要改进。

Abstract: Concept-Based Models (CBMs) are a class of deep learning models that provide
interpretability by explaining predictions through high-level concepts. These
models first predict concepts and then use them to perform a downstream task.
However, current CBMs offer interpretability only for the final task
prediction, while the concept predictions themselves are typically made via
black-box neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Concept Memory Reasoner (H-CMR), a new CBM that provides interpretability for
both concept and task predictions. H-CMR models relationships between concepts
using a learned directed acyclic graph, where edges represent logic rules that
define concepts in terms of other concepts. During inference, H-CMR employs a
neural attention mechanism to select a subset of these rules, which are then
applied hierarchically to predict all concepts and the final task. Experimental
results demonstrate that H-CMR matches state-of-the-art performance while
enabling strong human interaction through concept and model interventions. The
former can significantly improve accuracy at inference time, while the latter
can enhance data efficiency during training when background knowledge is
available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型Transformer架构，通过从中间向两侧动态跳过多层网络以提高计算效率。然而，在本文测试的规模范围内，该方法未能在验证交叉熵与FLOPs估计之间取得优于传统稠密基线的折中效果。

Motivation: 现有方法要么针对单个模块（如专家混合层），要么独立跳过层，未充分利用Transformer中间层的冗余性及早期层的聚合作用。

Method: 提出一种动态跳跃多个中间层的新架构，使用学习门控机制来判断是否跳过对称的中央模块范围，同时设计了一种门控注意力机制以避免后续tokens关注跳过的位置，并使用“夹心”或“层间归一化”方案控制残差幅度，以及通过自适应正则化损失控制门控稀疏性。

Result: 在本文研究的规模下，提出的方法未能在验证交叉熵与FLOPs估计之间的性能折中上超过稠密基线（更少层数的标准Transformer）。

Conclusion: 尽管该模型试图通过减少简单tokens的计算需求并构建层次化表示，测试结果显示其表现不如传统方法。

Abstract: Conditional computation is a popular strategy to make Transformers more
efficient. Existing methods often target individual modules (e.g.,
mixture-of-experts layers) or skip layers independently of one another.
However, interpretability research has demonstrated that the middle layers of
Transformers exhibit greater redundancy, and that early layers aggregate
information into token positions. Guided by these insights, we propose a novel
architecture that dynamically skips a variable number of layers from the middle
outward. In particular, a learned gating mechanism determines whether to bypass
a symmetric span of central blocks based on the input, and a gated attention
mechanism prevents subsequent tokens from attending to skipped token positions.
Residual norms are controlled with a 'sandwich' or 'perilayernorm' scheme and
gate sparsity with an adaptive regularization loss. We had aimed to reduce
compute requirements for 'simpler' tokens and potentially foster an emergent
multi-level representational hierarchy but, at the scales investigated, our
approach does not achieve improvements in the trade-off between validation
cross-entropy and estimated FLOPs compared to dense baselines with fewer
layers. We release our code at https://github.com/tim-lawson/skip-middle.

Abstract: Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.

Conclusion: 提出的抗脆弱RL框架能有效适应未见的敌对攻击，具备抗脆弱性并在无人机导航中实现更优表现。

Abstract: The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative

Method: 通过计算单词答案的熵，将训练数据分为不同复杂度类别，对小型模型进行监督微调和知识蒸馏，重点处理复杂数据以提高效率。

Result: 所提出的方法在减少62%训练数据的情况下，与蒸馏方法表现相当（平均准确率为0.55），并明显优于传统监督微调方法（0.55对比0.43的平均准确率）。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned
through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance performance in specific
domains. Better results can be achieved by distilling the chain-of-thought of a
larger model at the cost of numerous expensive calls and a much greater amount
of data. We propose a novel blueprint for efficient fine-tuning that uses
reasoning only for complex data identified by entropy. Specifically, across two
small open models ($\approx 3B$) we split the training data into complexity
categories by a single token answer entropy (ROC AUC $0.73$), fine-tune large
language models (LLMs) via SFT and distillation, and show that our pipeline
significantly outperforms the standard SFT approach ($0.55$ vs $0.43$ average
accuracy) and provides comparable with distillation performance while using
$62\%$ less data ($0.55$ average accuracy for both). We publish our code and
data to facilitate further research in this direction.

*Weikang Meng,Yadan Luo,Liangyu Huo,Yaowei Wang,Xin Li,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的Norm-Aware Linear Attention机制，解决了线性注意中的熵差和内积缺失问题，并提升了性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前线性注意力机制为降低复杂度，采用$L1$正则化代替softmax，但忽视了查询范数的影响，导致熵偏差，并限制查询和键向量为非负值，降低了表达能力。

Method: 提出Norm-Aware Linear Attention，解耦查询和键矩阵为范数和方向两部分，通过范数感知内核函数实现动态熵控制，并通过范数保持映射确保一致性，利用余弦相似性限制方向相反的维度。

Result: 实验中，NaLaFormer在视觉和语言任务中提升了多达4.2%的表现和效率。

Conclusion: 引入的新机制增强了注意力模块的表达力与效率，解决了现有方法的两大缺陷，展现了高效性的改进。

Abstract: Linear attention has emerged as a viable alternative to softmax attention by
reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length. To preserve
two fundamental properties of softmax, non-negativity and entropy reduction,
current works employ various linearly separatable kernel functions with $L1$
normalization instead of softmax operator. However, query norms are neglected
by the normalization operation in linear attention, such degradation heavily
leads to an entropy gap. Meanwhile, existing works inhibit negative values of
query and key vectors resulting in a missing inner-product interactions after
being mapped. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware
Linear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and
recover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple
query and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve
norm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We
mathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the
query norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel
function for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure
norm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a
norm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into
positive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with
opposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the
NaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both
expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大模型分布式训练对高速可靠的网络依赖强，这限制了训练在分布式慢速网络下的可行性。

Method: 提出了一种结合流水线并行、多优化器策略、一步延迟通信与本地训练重叠、自适应梯度压缩的框架（DiLoCoX）。

Result: 在1Gbps的网络上，使用DiLoCoX可以成功预训练一个107B模型，并实现比传统AllReduce方法357倍的速度提升，同时模型收敛几乎无损。

Conclusion: DiLoCoX框架在慢速网络条件下证明了大规模分布式模型训练的可行性，为去中心化集群的应用开辟了新的可能。

Abstract: The distributed training of foundation models, particularly large language
models (LLMs), demands a high level of communication. Consequently, it is
highly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.
Can we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of
decentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion
parameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale
decentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with
Dual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local
Training, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination
significantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model
pre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of
communication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression
scheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model
over a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x
speedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in
model convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized training framework successfully applied to models with over 100
billion parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为DBConformer的模型，可更有效地进行EEG信号解码，其性能优于现有主流方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了解决传统CNN短时间记忆问题及现有混合方法中局部与全局特征融合不足的问题。

Method: 提出了DBConformer，一种双分支卷积Transformer网络，其中包含时间Conformer和空间Conformer模块，并引入轻量级通道注意力模块。

Result: 经过五个运动想象数据集和两个癫痫检测数据集的测试，该模型在性能上优于10个基线模型，参数量显著减少，并展现了生理可解释性。

Conclusion: DBConformer在EEG信号解码中兼具高效性、可靠性和可解释性，为鲁棒且可解释的EEG解码提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) transform
spontaneous/evoked neural activity into control commands for external
communication. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream
backbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it
difficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel
relationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address
this issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration
of local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch
convolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding. It integrates a
temporal Conformer to model long-range temporal dependencies and a spatial
Conformer to extract inter-channel interactions, capturing both temporal
dynamics and spatial patterns in EEG signals. A lightweight channel attention
module further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven
importance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)
datasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings
demonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline
models, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG
Conformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the
features extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned
with sensorimotor priors in MI. The superior performance and interpretability
of DBConformer make it reliable for robust and explainable EEG decoding. Code
is publicized at https://github.com/wzwvv/DBConformer.

TL;DR: 本文引入基于生成对抗网络（cGAN）的方法生成隐匿的对抗样本，绕过入侵检测系统（IDS），并提出以条件变分自编码器（CVAE）为核心的检测机制，有效检测此类隐匿攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机（UAVs）融入民用空域，传统异常检测方法难以应对新型威胁，因此需要抗压且智能的入侵检测系统（IDS）。

Method: 利用 cGAN 模型生成伪装的对抗样本，使其在 IDS 中被误分类为正常数据，同时使用 CVAE 及其负对数似然方法检测这些伪装攻击。

Result: CVAE 模型对隐匿性高的对抗样本检测表现优于传统基于马氏距离的检测方法。在隐匿和成功率上，生成的对抗样本效果显著。

Conclusion: 高级概率建模技术可以有效增强 IDS 系统，对抗基于生成对抗模型的适应性网络攻击有重要意义。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

TL;DR: 论文提出 Latent Prototype Routing (LPR) 框架，通过聚类解决 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 模型的负载不平衡问题，实现了高效的专家均衡利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 MoE 系统存在负载不平衡问题，导致可用模型容量与计算资源严重浪费。作者希望解决这个问题，提高模型的总体效能。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于聚类的新型路由框架 Latent Prototype Routing (LPR)，其促进了专家之间的平衡利用，同时不牺牲性能。

Result: 在多个开放源代码的 MoE 模型实验中，LPR 将专家负载的基尼系数从 0.70 降到 0.035，提升最小-最大专家负载比值从 1e-6 至 0.70，实现了接近完美的负载均衡。

Conclusion: LPR 成功证明了作为一种通用路由框架的有效性，可以缓解负载不平衡问题并高效利用专家模型。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a key strategy for
scaling large language models (LLMs) efficiently. However, current MoE systems
suffer from severe load imbalance, where only a small subset of experts is
consistently activated during training and inference, leading to significant
underutilization of model capacity and computational resources. In this work,
we revisit expert routing through a clustering perspective and propose Latent
Prototype Routing (LPR), a novel routing framework that generalizes existing
approaches while promoting balanced expert utilization without compromising
downstream performance. Extensive experiments across multiple open-source MoE
models -- including DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-MoE, and Mixtral -- demonstrate that LPR
reduces the Gini coefficient of expert load from 0.70 to 0.035 on average,
improves the min-max expert load ratio from 1e-6 to 0.70, achieving
near-perfect load balancing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双提示学习和交叉融合的个性化联邦学习框架pFedDC，提升了模型在分布异构数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习因数据、计算和通信的异构性面临挑战，现有方法仅使用文本提示，未考虑联合标签-域分布的偏移。预训练视觉-语言模型具备泛化能力和高效调优潜力，有望解决这一问题。

Method: 通过全球提示和本地提示分别捕捉共享知识与客户端特性，并利用交叉融合模块整合提示层次，生成与客户端数据分布对齐的个性化表征。

Result: 在九个具有异构性的数据集上，pFedDC方法超越了最先进的方法，展现出一致的优越性能。

Conclusion: pFedDC框架实现了在分布异构环境下个性化联邦学习性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by
heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight
tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated
prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint
label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL
framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC.
Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision
and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across
the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain
characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively
integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate
personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data
distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of
heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了ScalaBL方法，在低维子空间中对大语言模型(LLMs)的权重进行贝叶斯推断，实现模型不确定性的量化，降低了参数需求，并扩展到目前最大规模的贝叶斯LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型在高风险领域存在如不准确信息和校准问题，因此需要对其不确定性进行量化。现有方法虽然有效，但对于更大规模模型的扩展存在挑战。

Method: 引入ScalaBL，通过重新利用LoRA参数为投影矩阵，对低维子空间中的样本进行贝叶斯推断，并使用随机变分推断学习模型参数，从而减少额外参数需求。

Result: ScalaBL在使用仅1000个额外参数的情况下，与先进方法具有竞争力的性能，并成功扩展到参数量为现有方法四倍的贝叶斯LLM。

Conclusion: ScalaBL提供了一种可扩展的低秩贝叶斯适配方法，减少参数需求的同时，显著提高了模型扩展潜力。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, large language models (LLMs) are known to
hallucinate incorrect information and be poorly calibrated. This makes the
uncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially
in high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made
Bayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by
performing inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a
fine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger
LLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this
work we present $\textbf{Scala}$ble $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{L}$ow-Rank
Adaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform
Bayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By
repurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map
samples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows
us to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational
inference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to
achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only
requiring ${\sim}1000$ additional parameters. Furthermore, it allows us to
scale up to the largest Bayesian LLM to date, with four times as a many base
parameters as prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于重要性和冗余度的方法虽然优化了网络，但仍存在进一步压缩的潜力。研究者受ReLU等激活函数的直线性启发，尝试开发新的压缩方法。

Method: 利用ReLU激活函数的线性特性，当神经元几乎总是被激活时，通过融合后续层实现基于线性化的压缩方法。

Result: 提出的方法在大多数测试模型中可以将原始模型的规模无损压缩到1/4，并且与基于重要性的压缩方法结合使用时干扰微小。

Conclusion: 这种新型方法为构建更小、更高效的神经网络模型提供了基础，可与现有技术互补，提升压缩效果。

Abstract: In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary
parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly
optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel
way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that
with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated
behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the
theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally.
Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original
model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on
already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between
different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful
combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type
of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural
network models.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.

Abstract: Perpetual voting addresses fairness in sequential collective decision-making
by evaluating representational equity over time. However, existing perpetual
voting rules rely on full participation and complete approval information,
assumptions that rarely hold in practice, where partial turnout is the norm. In
this work, we study the integration of Artificial Delegates,
preference-learning agents trained to represent absent voters, into perpetual
voting systems. We examine how absenteeism affects fairness and
representativeness under various voting methods and evaluate the extent to
which Artificial Delegates can compensate for missing participation. Our
findings indicate that while absenteeism significantly affects fairness,
Artificial Delegates reliably mitigate these effects and enhance robustness
across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: 該研究不僅提出了能成為標準技術的高效初始化方法，還為隨機初始化的理論分析開啟了新的方向。

Abstract: We revisit the randomized seeding techniques for k-means clustering and k-GMM
(Gaussian Mixture model fitting with Expectation-Maximization), formalizing
their three key ingredients: the metric used for seed sampling, the number of
candidate seeds, and the metric used for seed selection. This analysis yields
novel families of initialization methods exploiting a lookahead
principle--conditioning the seed selection to an enhanced coherence with the
final metric used to assess the algorithm, and a multipass strategy to tame
down the effect of randomization.
  Experiments show a consistent constant factor improvement over classical
contenders in terms of the final metric (SSE for k-means, log-likelihood for
k-GMM), at a modest overhead. In particular, for k-means, our methods improve
on the recently designed multi-swap strategy, which was the first one to
outperform the greedy k-means++ seeding.
  Our experimental analysis also shed light on subtle properties of k-means
often overlooked, including the (lack of) correlations between the SSE upon
seeding and the final SSE, the variance reduction phenomena observed in
iterative seeding methods, and the sensitivity of the final SSE to the pool
size for greedy methods.
  Practically, our most effective seeding methods are strong candidates to
become one of the--if not the--standard techniques. From a theoretical
perspective, our formalization of seeding opens the door to a new line of
analytical approaches.

Motivation: 现有的脑机接口系统难以应对跨个体和跨会话的变化，同时现有方法在捕捉EEG信号的复杂时空依赖性上效果有限。

Method: 提出了一个注意力图时空卷积网络（AGTCNet），利用EEG电极的地形配置引入归纳偏置，并结合图卷积注意力网络 (GCAT) 联合学习EEG的时空特征。

Conclusion: AGTCNet突出其高性能和快速推理能力，表明其在脑机接口领域的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology utilizing electroencephalography
(EEG) marks a transformative innovation, empowering motor-impaired individuals
to engage with their environment on equal footing. Despite its promising
potential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems
remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability
of neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware
constraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,
existing approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate
spatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study
addresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional
network (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)
classification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration
of EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional
attention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG
representations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG
classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact
architecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI
deployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference
time, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy
of 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV
Dataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for
subject-specific classification. On the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset,
AGTCNet achieved moving average accuracies of 64.14% and 85.22% for 4-class and
2-class subject-independent classifications, respectively, with further
improvements to 72.13% and 90.54% for subject-specific classifications.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的评估缺乏对实时动态数据处理能力的测试，无法满足当代应用的需求。

Method: 设计DynamicBench，结合网络搜索和本地数据库，通过提供或不提供外部文档的场景，测试模型的动态信息处理能力，并开发了高级报告生成系统。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无文档和有文档场景下均优于GPT4o，分别高出7.0%和5.8%。

Conclusion: DynamicBench有效评估了LLMs的实时信息处理能力，且实验结果表明其性能优越。

Abstract: Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on
static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to
capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in
contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench,
a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and
processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval
pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates
domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within
specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or
withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability
to independently process recent information or leverage contextual
enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system
adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results
confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and
document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data
will be made publicly available.

### [226] [Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21352)
*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究开发了持久拉普拉斯算子的特征值变化的渐进稳定性分析，提出了插入单个单形后特征值变化的统一Lipschitz界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前有关持久拉普拉斯算子的研究缺乏对单个特征值变化的精确控制，而这对下游工具使用特征值的稳定性至关重要。

Method: 证明了一个统一的Lipschitz界限，展示在插入单一单形时，每个持久拉普拉斯算子的特征值变化至多为单形边界的两倍欧几里得范数。

Result: 首次提出了光谱拓扑数据分析中特征值级别的稳健性保证，并实现对动态数据的可靠误差控制。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对持久拉普拉斯算子特征值的稳定性保障，确保了局部更新下光谱特征的稳定，助力动态数据设置中的应用。

Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and
structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology,
physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of
geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work
established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change
in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle,
is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools,
including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly
on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound:
after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary
by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of
filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first
eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis.
It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and
enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.

TL;DR: 本文探索了多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在医学任务中的多模态上下文学习能力的局限性，提出了第一个专家驱动的基准SMMILE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态上下文学习在医学领域具有潜力，但目前相关研究仍然不足。因此，研究MLLMs在医学情境下的能力，以应对临床中需要快速适应的多样性和专业化任务。

Method: 提出了SMMILE和扩展版本SMMILE++基准，其中包含由医学专家设计的多模态任务，并通过这些基准对15个MLLMs进行评估。

Result: 评估表明，多数模型在医疗任务中的多模态上下文学习能力较差，仅比零样本学习提升了微弱的性能。此外，任务表现容易受到无关示例的干扰，数据顺序对结果也有较大影响。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在医学多模态任务的上下文学习中存在显著局限性和偏差，需要针对性改进以增强其适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite
significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely
encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited
examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or
considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question
answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is
largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL
benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each
including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task
demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer
triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further
introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A
comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit
moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended
evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on
SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant
in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade
performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,
i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial
performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical
limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks
from context.

rQdia finally propels model-free continuous control from pixels over the state

Abstract: Nowadays, the rapid growth of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures has
established them as the defacto approach for providing advanced Machine
Learning tasks with excellent accuracy. Targeting low-power DNN computing, this
paper examines the interplay of fine-grained error resilience of DNN workloads
in collaboration with hardware approximation techniques, to achieve higher
levels of energy efficiency. Utilizing the state-of-the-art ROUP approximate
multipliers, we systematically explore their fine-grained distribution across
the network according to our layer-, filter-, and kernel-level approaches, and
examine their impact on accuracy and energy. We use the ResNet-8 model on the
CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate our approximations. The proposed solution delivers
up to 54% energy gains in exchange for up to 4% accuracy loss, compared to the
baseline quantized model, while it provides 2x energy gains with better
accuracy versus the state-of-the-art DNN approximations.

Result: NANOADAM方法在自然语言处理和视觉任务上均表现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NANOADAM减少了资源消耗，简单易用且改进了模型性能，尤其在关键权重保留和典型任务表现方面优势显著。

Abstract: Finetuning large pretrained neural networks is known to be
resource-intensive, both in terms of memory and computational cost. To mitigate
this, a common approach is to restrict training to a subset of the model
parameters. By analyzing the relationship between gradients and weights during
finetuning, we observe a notable pattern: large gradients are often associated
with small-magnitude weights. This correlation is more pronounced in finetuning
settings than in training from scratch. Motivated by this observation, we
propose NANOADAM, which dynamically updates only the small-magnitude weights
during finetuning and offers several practical advantages: first, this
criterion is gradient-free -- the parameter subset can be determined without
gradient computation; second, it preserves large-magnitude weights, which are
likely to encode critical features learned during pretraining, thereby reducing
the risk of catastrophic forgetting; thirdly, it permits the use of larger
learning rates and consistently leads to better generalization performance in
experiments. We demonstrate this for both NLP and vision tasks.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency transaction fraud detection faces the dual challenges of
increasingly complex transaction patterns and severe class imbalance.
Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture
temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper
proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that
enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced
temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with
periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention
mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context
attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance.
Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT
achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best
traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This
method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and
triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides
financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its
design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection
tasks.

Motivation: 现有的表格基础模型在上下文学习中表现优异，但推理成本高，特别是对于大数据集。

Method: 通过在每层Transformer编码器后动态评估是否终止上下文学习，并用预训练的解码器解码嵌入，优化推理效率。

Result: 在34个小分类任务中，推理速度提高了最多1.3倍，预测性能几乎无影响；在5个大分类任务中，速度提高了最多2.2倍。

Conclusion: 通过提前退出策略，可以显著提升表格上下文学习的运行效率，且性能损失可以忽略。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models have shown strong performance across various
tabular learning tasks via in-context learning, offering robust generalization
without any downstream finetuning. However, their inference-time costs remain
high, particularly for larger datasets. To address this, we propose
early-stopping the in-context learning process. We achieve this by dynamically
evaluating whether to stop in-context learning after each Transformer encoder
layer. Once stopped, we decode the embedding using a pre-trained layer-wise
decoder. Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early
stopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with
negligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we
further evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving
speedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting
as an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular
in-context learning.

Conclusion: D-CHAG方法显著提升了处理高维图像模态数据的效率，为科学发现中的视觉模型提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Vision-based scientific foundation models hold significant promise for
advancing scientific discovery and innovation. This potential stems from their
ability to aggregate images from diverse sources such as varying physical
groundings or data acquisition systems and to learn spatio-temporal
correlations using transformer architectures. However, tokenizing and
aggregating images can be compute-intensive, a challenge not fully addressed by
current distributed methods. In this work, we introduce the Distributed
Cross-Channel Hierarchical Aggregation (D-CHAG) approach designed for datasets
with a large number of channels across image modalities. Our method is
compatible with any model-parallel strategy and any type of vision transformer
architecture, significantly improving computational efficiency. We evaluated
D-CHAG on hyperspectral imaging and weather forecasting tasks. When integrated
with tensor parallelism and model sharding, our approach achieved up to a 75%
reduction in memory usage and more than doubled sustained throughput on up to
1,024 AMD GPUs on the Frontier Supercomputer.

Motivation: 为了解决生成模型在离线强化学习中多模态分布的高推理成本与训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 通过增强的流匹配目标训练生成性政策，利用直接完成向量从中间流样本进行单步动作生成，同时结合无模式政策提升生成效率和表现。

Result: SSCP在离线、离线转在线和在线强化学习场景中都表现良好，相较于基于扩散模型的基线具备显著优势，并在标准离线强化学习和行为克隆基准中取得了优异成绩。

Conclusion: SSCP是一种通用、高效且表现优异的深度强化学习框架，适用于多种序列决策任务。

Abstract: Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive
policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal
action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference
costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling
steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a
generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict
direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate,
one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP
combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and
inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long
backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline,
offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed
and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to
goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures
without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across
standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a
versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential
decision-making.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of using multimodal machine learning
techniques to detect deception in dyadic interactions, focusing on the
integration of data from both the deceiver and the deceived. We compare early
and late fusion approaches, utilizing audio and video data - specifically,
Action Units and gaze information - across all possible combinations of
modalities and participants. Our dataset, newly collected from Swedish native
speakers engaged in truth or lie scenarios on emotionally relevant topics,
serves as the basis for our analysis. The results demonstrate that
incorporating both speech and facial information yields superior performance
compared to single-modality approaches. Moreover, including data from both
participants significantly enhances deception detection accuracy, with the best
performance (71%) achieved using a late fusion strategy applied to both
modalities and participants. These findings align with psychological theories
suggesting differential control of facial and vocal expressions during initial
interactions. As the first study of its kind on a Scandinavian cohort, this
research lays the groundwork for future investigations into dyadic
interactions, particularly within psychotherapy settings.

Abstract: Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving
large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including
weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling.
However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains
challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study
introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK
methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed
heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven
mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition
mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic
parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly
improving computational efficiency.The proposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation
framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems,
including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT
runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining
numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of
adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity
simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in
real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other
demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic
optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration
using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual
layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer
pruning strategy.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring
system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting
anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of
faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models
that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this
challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that
integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process
mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected
from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These
anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the
discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By
incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach
supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root
cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using
the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart
manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,
simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation
of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the
development of digital twins for industrial environments.

on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the
health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct
awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision
tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical
cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by
devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading
cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing
cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.

*Xiaona Zhou,Constantin Brif,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了mTSBench，用于多变量时间序列异常检测和无监督模型选择，是现存最大的数据集基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MTS-AD领域中变量依赖性、时间动态性和标注稀疏性问题，推动模型选择的研究。

Method: 构建了包含344个时间序列、来自19个数据集的mTSBench基准，并评估了24种检测方法，包括基于LLM的检测器。研究标准化条件下的无监督模型选择。

Result: 验证了单一检测器在所有数据集上表现均优的难度，当前最优的模型选择方法仍有显著不足。

Conclusion: mTSBench提供了统一的评估框架，为适应性异常检测和稳健模型选择的进步奠定基础。

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains
like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains
challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and
sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for
MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series
across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24
anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors
for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model
selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior
findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets,
underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art
selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench
provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible
comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and
robust model selection.

### [242] [Where to find Grokking in LLM Pretraining? Monitor Memorization-to-Generalization without Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21551)
*Ziyue Li,Chenrui Fan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在大规模语言模型（LLM）预训练过程中依然会出现的grokking现象，即在训练损失收敛后测试性能仍能持续提升的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模神经网络模型中，grokking揭示了模型泛化能力和推理能力等特性的潜在神秘性，研究其机制有助于更好理解和改进模型训练。

Method: 作者首次在大规模模型OLMoE的单轮预训练过程中，通过分析多样基准任务的训练损失与泛化性能，结合提出的路径距离与单一路径复杂度的新度量指标，研究了groking的动态机制。

Result: 研究验证了grokking现象在大规模模型预训练中的普遍存在，并提出了一个记忆到泛化的转换机制。开发的指标能够有效预测模型在下游任务上的泛化表现。

Conclusion: 研究为理解grokking背后的泛化动力学提供了理论与实践支持，为监控大模型训后性能提供了新工具，同时揭示了路径结构对模型复杂度与泛化能力的影响。

Abstract: Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss
converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the
mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning
mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or
highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of
grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language
model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate
generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code
generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.
  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the
pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter
grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of
generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find
that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve
from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples
during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the
converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,
providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we
develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a
single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement
on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely
dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining,
enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and
test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model
complexity and improve the generalization bound.

### [243] [Spiking Neural Networks for SAR Interferometric Phase Unwrapping: A Theoretical Framework for Energy-Efficient Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20782)
*Marc Bara*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本研究首次提出将脉冲神经网络（SNN）应用于合成孔径雷达（SAR）干涉相位解缠的理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量呈指数增长，如NISAR任务预计两年生成100PB数据，需要能效更高的处理方式以实现可持续操作。而SNN以事件驱动计算模型带来显著节能潜力，同时保持精度。

Method: 开发了专门针对包裹相位数据的脉冲编码方案，设计利用相位解缠空间传播特性的SNN架构，并提供计算复杂性和收敛性的理论分析。

Result: 证明了SNN的时间动态特性可自然建模相位解缠的空间连续性约束。

Conclusion: 通过结合神经形态计算和SAR干涉仪方法，提出了一种有潜力促进更可持续大规模干涉合成孔径雷达处理的新方法。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural
networks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase
unwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive
literature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase
unwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth
observation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like
NISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing
becomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their
event-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x
compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We
develop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,
propose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase
unwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and
convergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics
inherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints
fundamental to phase unwrapping. This work opens a new research direction at
the intersection of neuromorphic computing and SAR interferometry, offering a
complementary approach to existing algorithms that could enable more
sustainable large-scale InSAR processing.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models
by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher
models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates
low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.
Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer
data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We
introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural
activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model
for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1)
Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations
through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects
latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via
supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in
memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene
reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The
results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer
converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in
isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable
for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex
decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely
artificial training.

Abstract: Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.

Abstract: The concurrent optimization of language models and instructional prompts
presents a significant challenge for deploying efficient and effective AI
systems, particularly when balancing performance against computational costs
like token usage. This paper introduces and assesses a bi-objective
evolutionary search engine designed to navigate this complex space, focusing
specifically on Small Language Models (SLMs). We employ the NSGA-II algorithm
and prompt grammar to simultaneously optimize for task accuracy and token
efficiency across some reasoning tasks. Our results successfully identify
diverse, high-performing model-prompt combinations, quantitatively revealing
the critical trade-off between the two objectives. This research highlights
task-specific affinities between particular SLMs and prompt structures (e.g.,
instructions, context, chain of thought). The generated practical Pareto fronts
offer decision-makers a portfolio of optimized solutions adaptable to their
specific constraints. This automated approach moves beyond traditional manual
tuning, providing a foundational framework for discovering effective human-AI
interaction patterns.
