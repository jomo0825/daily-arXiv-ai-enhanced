### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SPFF的模型，通过随机过滤图像中的不相关区域，以提高对食物图像进行小样本分类的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对食物图像在小样本学习中的复杂性和高变性问题，解决因食物摆盘、光照及角度差异所导致的分类错误问题。

Method: 引入了一种基于随机的Patch过滤(SPFF)方法，通过随机过滤与类别相关性较低的Patch嵌入来强化类表示。使用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像间的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256等数据集上表现出色，并超过现有最先进方法的表现。

Conclusion: SPFF能有效聚焦于食物类特征区域并过滤无关部分，显著提高了小样本分类的性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文致力于利用自监督学习消除人工标注数据的需求，并实现模型能够无缝扩展至大型数据集和架构的愿景。

Method: 通过改进数据准备、模型设计及优化，提出Gram anchoring方法解决密集特征图随训练时间退化的问题，同时引入后处理策略增强模型的分辨率、尺寸及文本对齐的灵活性。

Result: DINOv3生成高质量的视觉基础模型，在多个任务中，无需微调，超越了之前的自监督和弱监督模型的性能。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉任务提供了一个灵活、可扩展的解决方案，展示了在不同任务和资源限制下的杰出性能，同时推动了视觉基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的甲骨文解码方法，通过结合部首分析和图形-语义理解，提升了解码性能及可解释性，并公开了相关数据集和代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种深度学习方法，自动定位全身双能X射线吸收法扫描图像的关键点，并在外部测试数据集上达到了99.5%的关键点准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决当前基于手工标注的DXA扫描图像关键点定位效率低、成本高的问题，提供一种全新的自动化解决方案。

Method: 基于深度学习方法，使用1683个手动标注的全身双能X射线吸收扫描图像，开发并验证了一种自动化定位重要关键点的方法。另在测试中，针对不同扫描模式与健康标记进行了统计关联性研究。

Result: 所提方法在外部测试数据上达到了99.5%的正确关键点率，并成功生成了与健康标志相关的新假设，提供了扎实的理论验证。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了关键点检测的自动化准确率，还为身体成分与形态建模与健康标志间的潜在关系提供了新的洞察，表现出广阔的科学应用潜力。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的多模态学习方法——基于多模态注意力的正态化流(MANGO)，通过显式、可解释且可解析的多模态融合学习，提出多种创新交叉注意机制以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法通过Transformer注意力机制进行隐式关联的学习，未能有效捕获每种模态的本质特征，难以处理复杂的多模态输入结构和关联。

Method: 提出基于多模态注意力的正态化流(MANGO)方法，核心是一种可逆交叉注意(ICA)层，包括三种新的交叉注意机制：模态对模态(MMCA)、模态间(IMCA)、以及可学习模态间(LICA)交叉注意。

Result: 在三种多模态学习任务上（语义分割、图像到图像翻译、电影类型分类）实验表明，该方法性能达到了最新的SoTA水平。

Conclusion: 提出的MANGO方法能够高效捕获复杂多模态数据的潜在关联，具有良好的可扩展性，在不同多模态任务上展示出卓越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究表明，在作物疾病分类中，将少量真实图像与大量合成图像结合使用可以显著提高模型性能，相比于单独使用真实或合成图像效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式人工智能（GenAI）模型的进步为生成高分辨率的合成图像提供了新可能，特别是在农业计算机视觉模型的训练中，可减少对昂贵实地数据收集的依赖，但对结合真实与合成图像的方法研究较少。

Method: 研究在西瓜疾病分类场景下，结合真实与合成图像，分析不同组合比例对EfficientNetV2-L模型的性能影响，设计五种训练集处理方案（H0:仅真实图像，H1:仅合成图像，H2:1:1真实-合成，H3:1:10真实-合成，H4:在H3基础上增加随机图像），并采用增强的微调和迁移学习技术训练模型。

Result: 模型在H2、H3和H4处理下表现出高精确度、召回率和F1分数，尤其是加权F1分数从仅真实图像的0.65（H0）提升到1.00（H3-H4），表明少量真实图像加入大量合成图像可提升模型性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 单纯依赖真实或合成图像不足以最大化作物疾病分类模型的性能，真实与合成图像的结合能够显著提高模型的表现和适应性。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种基于高质量合成数据生成的框架，可提升大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等小众领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在隐私敏感和数据稀缺的工业应用中性能下降的问题。

Method: 通过高质量的合成数据生成（SynSpill数据集）与参数高效微调（PEFT）技术来提高VLMs及目标检测器的性能。

Result: 使用SynSpill数据后，VLMs和目标检测器（如YOLO和DETR）的性能显著提升，并在罕见的泄漏场景下表现可比。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据可有效弥合工业领域中的数据缺口，为视觉系统在稀缺数据环境中的成本效益应用提供路径。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于3D高斯表面表示(3DGS)数据压缩的新方法——EntropyGS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS数据存储与传输中的压缩需求，同时保持高效的渲染质量。

Method: 分析3DGS高斯属性的统计特性，提出基于分布参数估计的分解参数化熵编码方法（EntropyGS）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EntropyGS实现了约30倍的压缩率，同时保持了与原始数据接近的渲染质量，编码和解码时间快速。

Conclusion: EntropyGS有效减少3DGS数据存储和传输的压力，为3D视图合成提供了一种高效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Method: 提出了CellSymphony，多模态框架结合了Xenium转录组配置文件和组织学图像的基础模型嵌入，学习联合表示形式，从而融合空间基因表达和形态学背景。

Result: CellSymphony能够准确地进行细胞类型注释，还揭示了三种癌症类型中独特的微环境生态位。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和多模态融合可以有效解析复杂组织生态系统中细胞的生理和表型协调。

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep

### [12] [MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10264)
*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为MRFD的新解码方法，减少了大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中的幻觉问题，增强了视觉信息的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有大型视觉语言模型在处理图文不一致时容易产生幻觉，本文旨在通过改进解码方法提高模型的事实基础能力。

Method: 提出了无需重新训练的多区域融合解码方法（MRFD）。通过交叉注意力确定图像中显著区域，再为这些区域生成初始响应，并根据响应之间的Jensen-Shannon散度计算可靠性权重，从而实现对每区域预测的一致性融合。

Result: 实验表明，在多个模型和基准测试中，MRFD显著减少了幻觉现象，提高了响应的事实准确性。

Conclusion: MRFD作为一种训练无关的方法，通过增强区域一致性显著改进了大型视觉语言模型的多模态任务表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [13] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究解决在外观基础的注视点（PoG）估计中，由于个体差异带来的泛化问题，提出了一个移动基准数据集及动态校准策略，提高了对头部姿态变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于个体差异，注视点估计器难以泛化，需要个性化校准。但现有校准方法对头部姿态变化敏感，需探究解决方法。

Method: 首先构建了包含32人脸部图像的移动注视点基准数据集（MobilePoG）；分析校准点与头部姿态多样性对估计精度的影响；提出动态校准策略，通过用户移动设备引入头部姿态变化。

Result: 实验表明，通过宽范围头部姿态校准，估计器对姿态变化的鲁棒性得以改进；动态校准策略提高校准效率与效果。

Conclusion: 引入动态校准策略，使注视点估计器对头部姿态变化更鲁棒，同时提升用户体验，代码及数据集开放共享。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

TL;DR: 提出了一种提高多模态光学图像匹配精度的子像素模板匹配方法PCWLAD，并通过实验验证了其在多个数据集中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像中因不同光谱响应引起的非线性辐射和几何变形影响了匹配精度，亟需设计高精度匹配算法。

Method: 提出了基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的子像素模板匹配方法，包括两个步骤：首先利用结构相似性索引（SSIM）进行粗匹配；然后基于辐射与几何变换模型进行细匹配，并使用WLAD准则与互结构滤波优化匹配精度。

Result: 通过三个数据集验证了PCWLAD方法的效果，包括可见光-红外Landsat图像、可见光-近红外近景图像以及可见光-红外无人机图像。PCWLAD在匹配率和误差方面优于八种现有方法，平均匹配精度达到约0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法有效改善了多模态光学图像匹配精度，为图像的几何处理提供了可靠基础，其相关软件及数据集已公开。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Motivation: 旨在克服现有方法中单人和多人动作分离处理的不足，提升动作生成的真实性和自然性。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：INS模块从单人视角联合建模单人和互动行为；REC模块精炼互动态并确保角色间动作同步。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的动作序列在文本与动作匹配度及多样性上优于现有方法，成为新的基准。

Conclusion: InterSyn提供了一种更自然、鲁棒的动作生成方法，并计划开源以支持该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

Motivation: 随着对AI安全性关注的增加，OoD检测与分割受到越来越多的关注。传统的OoD检测方法仅能识别OoD对象是否存在，而无法进行空间定位，这限制了其在下游任务中的实用性。

Method: 将当前OoD分割方法分为四类：测试时间的OoD分割、基于异常暴露的监督训练、基于重建的方法以及利用强大模型的方法，并系统性地回顾其适用于自动驾驶场景的进展。

Conclusion: 论文为OoD分割在自动驾驶中的应用提供了一个全面的视角，并为未来深化研究指出了有效的路径。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Conclusion: RL提供了一种进行高层需求驱动优化的有效工具，但在与生成建模结合时仍存在若干开放性挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

Conclusion: 这项方法提供了一种有效工具，能够解释和量化STEM数据中的退化模式，与辐射诱导的原子不稳定性相关联。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

Conclusion: 该方法通过同步生成图像及其对应的场景内在属性，提升了图像生成模型的整体性能，显著改善了空间一致性与视觉真实性。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分割方法在处理显性标签噪声方面研究较多，但对于数据集中存在的隐性标签噪声缺乏相应研究，这种噪声可能来自于边界模糊性和标注者差异等问题，仍然会对模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 提出NSegment+，一个全新的增强框架，通过对分割标签引入可控的弹性变形，同时保持图像不变，帮助模型学习更鲁棒的目标结构表征，同时应对轻微的标签不一致性问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行实验，在Vaihingen、LoveDA、Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC数据集上mIoU分别提升了2.29、2.38、1.75和3.39。结合CutMix和Label Smoothing等技巧后，性能进一步增强。

Conclusion: NSegment+通过解耦图像和标签变换，有效应对隐性标签噪声，提高了语义分割模型的性能。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Conclusion: PQ-DAF框架为了解决少样本学习和域差异问题提供了一种有效解决方案，验证了其在少样本驾驶分心检测中的优势。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为选择性抑制 (SSDV) 的新方法，以解决文本到图像扩散模型中因词语强烈交织内容导致的控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像扩散模型（T2I）在生成基于文本提示的高质量多样化图像方面取得突破，但面对某些词语强烈交织特定内容的难题（如明令禁止胡子仍出现在“查理·卓别林”图像中），模型表现力存在不足。

Method: 提出通过文本嵌入空间的 Delta 向量来削弱生成图像中不需要内容的影响，并引入一种选择性抑制 SSDV 方法，将 Delta 向量应用到交叉注意机制中，实现更加有效的局部抑制。个性化T2I模型的精确抑制通过优化Delta向量完成。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，不论是在定量还是定性评价指标上均表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究在避免生成某些不需要内容的同时，对提升个性化文本到图像模型的精准控制展示了前所未有的潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SC-Lane的3D车道检测框架，该框架能够感知坡度并提高高度一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样道路几何时鲁棒性较差，且难以保持高度预测的时间一致性。

Method: 通过引入坡度感知的自适应特征模块，动态融合多坡度高度特征，并通过高度一致性模块确保连续帧之间的预测稳定性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane实现了64.3%的F-score，超越了现有方法，显著提升高度估计和3D车道检测性能。

Conclusion: SC-Lane在复杂道路环境下展现了卓越性能，为未来相关研究提供了基准标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: 提出了NanoControl，改进了基于DiT的可控文本到图像生成，显著减少了计算开销，生成质量和可控性表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT可控文本到图像生成方法基于ControlNet框架，导致参数和计算开销较大。

Method: 设计了NanoControl，采用LoRA风格低秩适配模块和KV-Context Augmentation机制以低成本实现可控生成。

Result: NanoControl以极低的参数和GFLOPs增量实现了优异的生成质量和控制能力，计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: NanoControl证明了低参数和计算开销下也可实现高质量和高效的可控生成，具有显著的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: 提出了STRIDE-QA，一个大规模视觉问答数据集，以解决视觉语言模型在动态交通场景中的时空推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型因依赖静态、网络来源的数据，难以进行动态交通场景所需的精确时空推理。

Method: 构建了STRIDE-QA数据集，从100小时多传感器驾驶数据生成16百万个问答对，支持对象和自我中心的推理，并设计了三个新问题任务。

Result: 经过STRIDE-QA微调的视觉语言模型在任务中表现显著提高，在空间定位和未来运动预测任务中分别达到55%和28%的成功率。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的、用于自动驾驶的视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Conclusion: CRISP能够有效解决长时间持续的视频实例分割任务中的挑战，同时是对领域内的重要改进。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最佳方法(SOTA)。

Conclusion: 通过单模态标注实现优异的红外-可见光目标检测，可有效降低标注成本并提升检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Conclusion: 该研究显著降低了对专有CAD系统和手动标注的依赖，为建筑行业特别是中小企业实现电气布局数字化提供了可行路径，有力推进了建筑信息标准化、互操作性及可持续性发展。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Motivation: 探索人类视觉感知是否由图像统计推动，并验证视觉模型对视觉扭曲的感知能力。

Method: 设计了一个模仿视网膜-V1皮层的生物启发架构PerceptNet，进行了端到端优化用于自动编码、去噪、去模糊和稀疏正则化任务。

Result: PerceptNet的V1-like层以最优方式与人类感知对图像扭曲的判断相关联，特别是在中等噪声、模糊和稀疏条件下。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定水平的扭曲进行调节，而无需人工监督的生物启发模型能够学习到感知指标。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Motivation: 提升现有在线视频超分辨率方法的长时间建模能力和计算效率，解决仅借助前一帧进行时间对齐的局限性。

Method: 引入轨迹感知的Shifted State Space Models，利用轨迹生成选取先前帧的相似Token，再通过包含Hilbert扫描与Shift操作的SSMs模块进行信息聚合，同时设计轨迹感知损失函数来优化模型训练。

Result: 在三个VSR广泛使用的测试数据集上，相较于六种基准在线VSR模型，TS-Mamba在大多数情况下表现出最先进的性能，并实现了超过22.7%的计算复杂度减少。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba有效结合了长时建模和计算效率，在保持性能提升的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold

inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.

Motivation: 减轻标注数据的需求，尤其是在全容积的医学影像场景中，如脑部磁共振成像（MRI），以便推动在新解剖结构或新成像技术中的研究发展。

Method: 1. 通过自动voxel分组生成合成图像以训练初始模型；2. 训练卷积自动编码器(AE)，利用其重建误差评估无标签数据的预测质量；3. 使用高质量伪标签对网络进行微调。

Conclusion: 结合领域随机化与AE质量控制的方法能够显著优化半监督分割，减少对标注数据的依赖，有助于推动医学影像领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TweezeEdit的新方法，能够在保留源图像语义的同时，通过一致性模型快速进行文本引导的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在进行基于文本的图像编辑时，通常过于依赖目标描述，同时无法很好地保留源图像的语义信息。此外，这些方法还存在编辑路径较长的效率问题。

Method: 提出一种无需调优和反演的新框架TweezeEdit，通过对整个去噪路径进行正则化而非仅依赖反演锚点，结合梯度驱动的正则化和一致性模型，直接注入目标描述的语义。

Result: 实验结果表明，TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐方面表现优越，并且相比现有方法效率更高，仅需12步（每步编辑耗时1.6秒），适合实时应用。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit是一个高效且准确的图像编辑方法，为基于文本的图像编辑提供了兼具实时性和保真度的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Motivation: 3D高斯点云分布在实时视角合成中表现优异，但几何约束不足导致细节模糊，特别在高频纹理和尖锐过渡区域问题突出。

Method: 通过引入多重采样抗锯齿（MSAA）结合双重几何约束的优化框架：（a）动态权重策略，利用梯度分析聚焦欠重建区域；（b）梯度微分约束，用于在目标边界处实现几何正则化。

Result: 实验展示了在多个测试基准中的细节重建表现优异，在结构相似度（SSIM）和感知质量（LPIPS）指标上显著优于基线，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在高频细节纹理和锐边重建方面性能卓越，优化重点策略实现了细节与全局一致性的平衡，有效改善了现有基线方法的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Motivation: 目前关于视觉推理的不少研究经常孤立地讨论不同的推理类型，而缺乏对各类型推理方法论及评估方法的统一分析与对比。

Method: 将视觉推理分为五种主要类型：关系推理、符号推理、时间推理、因果推理及常识推理。同时系统性分析了其实现方式，如基于图的模型、记忆网络、注意力机制及神经符号系统，并审视相关评价协议。

Result: 总结了当前评估方法的局限性（包括泛化性、重现性及解释性不足），并指出了视觉推理面临的挑战，例如更复杂场景下的可扩展性、神经与符号范式的更深度结合等。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

Conclusion: 通过结合全局和区域感知的特征提取和增强，本文提出的GCRPNet模型在光学遥感图像的显著目标检测任务上取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新方法有效解决了部分标注数据的域差异和标签缺失问题，为视网膜疾病检测提供了性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

TL;DR: 这篇文章提出了一种名为RAP（Retrieval-Augmented Prompt）的新方法，通过从外部知识中获取语义监督来增强OOD（Out-of-Distribution）检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因为有限的异常样本和它们与真实测试样本的不匹配，导致语义监督不足，从而表现欠佳，因此作者提出一种新的解决方法。

Method: RAP方法利用预训练的视觉-语言模型，并通过检索外部知识来增强模型的提示，包括在训练中加入外部描述词以及在测试时动态更新提示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集的1-shot OOD检测中，RAP方法将平均FPR95降低了7.05%，同时AUROC提高了1.71%，在OOD检测基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: RAP方法显著提高了OOD检测的性能，验证了语义增强和动态更新策略的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PTQAT的混合量化算法，可以在保持模型精度的同时减少训练资源的消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型量化方法存在性能与资源消耗的矛盾：PTQ性能下降严重，而QAT资源消耗较高。

Method: 该方法通过对关键层进行QAT微调，其他层使用PTQ，实现了性能和资源消耗之间的平衡。其中创新性地选择了较小输出差距的层进行微调，以更好地补偿量化误差的传播。

Result: 该方法在nuScenes数据集上3D感知任务中表现优越，包括目标检测(提高0.2%-0.9% NDS和0.3%-1.0% mAP)、语义分割和占用预测(提高0.3%-2.0% mIoU)。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效通用的量化方法，支持多种位宽和模型体系结构，能够在保持接近QAT性能的同时显著减少计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动的人脸视频生成方法往往存在运动模糊和嘴唇抖动问题，原因是对音频和面部动作相关性的隐式建模缺乏显式语音相关动作的指导。作者有意解决这些缺陷，提高视频生成的质量和准确性。

Method: 提出了一种混合运动表示方法，结合隐式和显式运动特征。通过Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM)，提取互补的隐式和显式运动特征，并从音频输入中直接预测动作单元（AUs），实现音频与视觉的对齐。同时，通过Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM)随机组合隐式和显式特征，保证学习的身份无关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和嘴唇同步精度上均优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动建模有效改善了音频驱动人脸视频的质量，展现了在跨主体生成任务中的潜力，解决了现有方法的若干局限性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: 在多种基准测试中，证明了基于雷达融合的方法在安全关键场景中对提升运动理解、长期预测与碰撞规避的有效性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）的编码器进行微调，结合空间-时间特征增强（STFE）和多尺度解码器融合（MSDF），用于遥感变化检测（RSCD）。


<details>

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple

*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Multi-Modal Agent的新方法，用于在训练自由的情况下解决基于参考的多模态视频对象分割任务，并在RVOS和Ref-AVS任务中显示出性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的视频对象分割方法需要高计算复杂性和大量的手动标注，而基于视听语言基础模型的研究虽然具备一定潜力，但缺乏任务动态适应性。

Method: 提出一种利用大型语言模型来生成动态工作流的代理系统Multi-Modal Agent，并结合专门为不同模态设计的工具，以通过多轮交互完成动态目标识别。

Result: 在两个基于多模态条件的VOS任务（RVOS和Ref-AVS）上，相较于现有方法，展示了显著的性能改进。

Conclusion: 证明了通过融合大语言模型的智能方法和动态流程可进一步提高多模态任务的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

TL;DR: 提出了HumanSense基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在人类交互场景中的感知和互动能力，并通过多阶段强化学习和提示设计改善模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在人类交互场景中的复杂人类意图理解和同理心响应能力尚需提升，缺乏精细化评估框架。

Method: 设计了一个综合基准HumanSense，用于测试MLLMs的多模态上下文理解能力；利用多阶段强化学习增强Omni模型推理能力；通过构造提示无训练提升非推理模型表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在高级交互任务上仍有改进空间；补充音频和文本信息的模型表现显著提升，Omni模型在这些任务中表现出优势。

Conclusion: 推理能力是生成上下文相关反馈的关键；设计一致性思维模式可提升模型推理与表现。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Motivation: 解决单帧和多帧方法无法有效应对复杂湍流畸变的困难，改进图像质量处理能力。

Method: 提出 EvTurb 框架，利用事件流解耦模糊和倾斜效应，包括事件积分减少模糊和利用方差图去除倾斜畸变；并引入 TurbEvent 数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，EvTurb 在效果上超越了最新方法，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决湍流畸变提供了新的高效路径，并通过数据和模型创新，提升了处理挑战性问题的能力。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为P$^3$A的新方法，用于提升自主驾驶中2D目标检测对抗补丁攻击的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的黑盒攻击依赖于转移性来减少计算开销，但现有方法通常高估攻击效果，尤其在高分辨率数据集上的表现不佳。

Method: P$^3$A框架采用全新的实际攻击成功率(PASR)指标，提出了定位-置信度抑制损失(LCSL)，并引入概率性尺度保持填充(PSPP)作为数据预处理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，P$^3$A在看不见的模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有最先进的方法，无论是实际IoU评估指标还是以往的mAP指标。

Conclusion: P$^3$A为2D目标检测的对抗补丁攻击提供了一种更强大、更实用的框架，特别适用于高分辨率数据集和实际应用场景。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA)的轻量级图像超分辨率上采样模块，通过融入多层感知机、相关注意力层和频域损失来增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统上采样方法在高频细节重建和抗混叠能力上的不足。

Method: 集成了基于傅里叶特征的多层感知机、跨分辨率相关注意力层以及频域L1损失进行频率编码、空间对齐和高频监督。

Result: 在五种主流超分辨率模型中，平均PSNR提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升高达29%。

Conclusion: FGA模块有效减少混叠伪影并保留精细细节，是传统上采样方法的实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种新框架FIND-Net用于金属伪影消除，通过结合频率和空间域处理实现更好的伪影压制以及结构保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习算法在消除CT成像中的金属伪影时，难以在伪影压制和结构细节保留中取得平衡，提出FIND-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FIND-Net框架结合Fast Fourier Convolution(FFC)层与可训练高斯滤波，将金属伪影消除视为跨空间和频率域的混合任务，用以加强全局上下文理解与频率选择性。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有最优算法相比，FIND-Net在MAE、SSIM和PSNR方面分别提升了3.07%、0.18%和0.90%，表现出对不同伪影复杂性环境的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FIND-Net展现了在抑制金属引起失真和保持解剖区域完整性方面的优越性，为金属伪影消除及其临床适用性提供了新进展。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型质量的提高往往以多样性降低为代价，限制了其在合成训练数据中的实用性。作者希望研发可同时提升生成数据质量及多样性的引导方法。

Method: 提出Chamfer Guidance，这是一种无训练引导方法，利用少量真实图片样本来衡量合成数据的质量和多样性，从而实现改进。

Result: 在使用少量真实图片（例如2或32张）作为参考的情况下，该方法在分类精度、分布覆盖等指标上达到了当前最佳表现。同时，该方法相比传统引导方法在计算量上降低31%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance 极大提升了生成模型在生成多样性和质量上的平衡，可用于合成训练数据来显著提高下游分类任务的表现，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型忽略环境传感器因果信号、依赖单一来源字幕以及缺乏交互场景推理的问题。

Method: 创建一个包含177k图像和丰富传感器元数据的数据集，使用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0注释数据以增加多样性，并利用LoRA适配器微调Qwen-2.5-VL模型用于交互。

Result: 在时序推理和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1为0.903），并支持交互场景分析，优于现有时序模型。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个传感器感知能力强，适用于环境监测的强大工具。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 通过分析图像采集过程的参数及其对语义预测性能的影响，评估视觉编码器表示中是否编码了这些参数。

Result: 细微或人眼难以觉察的图像采集参数被系统性学习编码，这些参数对语义预测的正负影响取决于其与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 图像采集参数和细微变换对视觉模型性能具有深远影响，应在模型设计和评估中加以考虑。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT)的框架，旨在通过共享属性级别的知识提升视觉转移学习的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类任务在未知类别上的泛化能力受限，作者希望通过利用视觉语言模型解决这一挑战，改善跨类别的知识转移。

Method: 设计了一个两步提示策略，提取共享的视觉属性并生成属性级别的描述，同时通过属性加权减少噪声，并对图像嵌入与文本嵌入进行联合对齐，以平衡分类性能和转移能力。

Result: SemPT在15个基准数据集上进行了广泛实验，在基础到新类别泛化、跨数据集转移、跨领域转移以及少样本学习等多种场景中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过在类别暴露下动态选择标签嵌入或属性增强嵌入，确保了对已知类别的精确分类，同时显著提高了对未知类别的适配能力。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Conclusion: UniBench300为多模态视觉研究提供了一个统一的基准，解决了测试不一致性问题，支持稳健的多任务统一。

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的模型AddressVLM，用于城市中基于街景图像的精细化地址定位，显著提升了地址定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大型视觉语言模型在精细化街道级别定位表现不佳，无法有效处理城市中的地址定位问题。

Method: 提出AddressVLM模型，通过引入视角不变的卫星图像作为宏观线索，并设计了跨视野对齐调整、图像拼接和自动标签生成等机制。模型包括跨视野对齐调整和地址定位调整两个阶段的训练协议。

Result: 实验结果显示，AddressVLM在匹兹堡和旧金山的两组数据集上的地址定位准确性分别提高了9%和12%。

Conclusion: 通过整合街景图像和卫星图像信息，AddressVLM成功提高了在城市级别精细化地址定位任务中的性能，展示了其在此领域的应用价值。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战要求构建一个高质量人脸数据集，同时确保数据集中身份不与现有公开数据集重叠，以更好地训练人脸识别模型。

Method: 通过混合专家策略清理HSFace数据集，包括聚类和GPT-4o辅助验证；结合GAN和扩散模型（Stable Diffusion）的混合方法生成多样化合成身份，并使用Vec2Face扩展样本；采用课程学习策略优化模型训练。

Result: 最终数据集每个身份包含50张图像，模型在10K、20K和100K身份规模上表现出性能提升，并在竞技赛中取得第一名。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合多种技术成功构建了一个高质量的人脸数据集，验证了其在提升模型表现方面的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低阶特征相关性建模和单一时间尺度特征提取上存在不足，难以应对目标小、强度弱及运动模式复杂的挑战。

Method: 通过三大模块（GTEM、LTEM、TAM），实现高阶空间时间特征相关性建模和多时间尺度特征增强。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上的实验表明，HyperTea达到了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea有效整合多种神经网络技术，提供了移动红外小目标检测的全新方向，显著提升了检测效果。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

Motivation: 胎儿脑部MRI的T2成像面临采集时间长和运动伪影问题，尤其是在0.55T中场，现有方法难以在多TE条件下进行高效的重建。

Method: 提出了结合隐式神经表示与基于物理T2衰减的正则化方法，来联合处理与重建多TE条件下受运动伪影影响的数据，从而提高成像的效率和质量。

Result: 在模拟的胎儿脑部数据和具有胎儿类似运动的成人数据中展示了最先进的性能，并首次实现了0.55T中场下的胎儿T2成像结果。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，通过共享解剖冗余信息，可以降低每TE需要采集的数据量，从而为胎儿T2成像提供更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Conclusion: IADGPT可以像人类一样进行少样本工业异常检测，有助于提高工业产品检测的自动化水平。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

Motivation: 现有方法需要多视角数据进行训练或重新训练扩散模型，代价高昂，且生成图像模糊并泛化性差，因此需要一种轻量化、高效的视角转换框架。

Method: 通过DDIM倒置策略，从输入图像的潜在表示中提取信息，使用摄像机位姿条件化的U-Net (TUNet) 预测目标视角的潜在表示，同时提出一种基于噪声相关结构的新型融合策略以改善图像细节和纹理。

Result: 在MVImgNet数据集上的实验表明，这种方法在性能上超过了现有的方法，生成效果更优。

Conclusion: 本文方法充分利用预训练扩散模型生成能力，并结合创新融合策略，提供一种有效的单图像多视角生成方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: MCFNet利用事件相机与RGB相机结合，并提出了多模块网络提升检测性能，特别适用于复杂光照条件下的交通场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机的动态范围有限，导致复杂交通环境中（如夜间驾驶、隧道内）对比度降低及边缘细节丢失，从而影响物体检测性能。

Method: MCFNet结合事件相机和RGB相机，通过事件校正模块（ECM）对事件流和图像流进行时间对齐，利用事件动态上采样模块（EDUM）提高空间分辨率，并通过交叉模态融合模块（CMM）进行自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验中，MCFNet优于现有方法，特别是在DSEC-Det上mAP50提高7.4%、mAP提高1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet设计的多模块增强特征提取和融合，在复杂光照和快速移动场景下表现出色，为增强基于事件与图像结合的检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

Motivation: 扩散式文本图像生成模型在图像质量和多样性上表现优越，但在准确反映输入提示中指定的对象数量上存在困难。现有方法仍未能有效解决这一问题，且忽略了去噪过程早期时间步中一个重要的结构特性：对象数量的决定。

Method: 提出CountCluster方法，在推断时无需额外工具或训练，通过根据注意力分数将对象交叉注意力图划分为k个簇，定义一个空间上分离良好的理想分布，并优化潜在变量以与目标分布对齐。

Result: 与现有方法相比，CountCluster在对象数量准确性上平均提升了18.5%，并在多种提示下展现了出色的数量控制性能。

Conclusion: CountCluster显著提高了生成图像中对象数量的准确性，为扩散式生成模型的数量控制带来了优异的改进，并公开了代码以供进一步研究。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: SegDAC在视觉强化学习中表现出优越的视觉泛化能力和效率，展示了解决高维视觉问题和样本效率的潜力。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Result: DCPE作为插件方法，可无缝集成到现有模型框架中，加速训练过程42%，并改善FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE有效利用了代码本中的代币相似性信息，为离散代币生成任务提供了一种更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为EgoCross的新基准来评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在自我中心视频问答中的跨领域泛化能力，实验表明现有模型在这一方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的研究和基准主要局限于日常生活活动，而真实世界的应用需要处理视觉风格和语义内容差异很大的领域。

Method: 设计了EgoCross基准，涵盖手术、工业、极限运动和动物视角四个领域，包含大约1000个问答对（开放式和封闭式），支持细粒度评估。进行了多种实验以测试现有模型和探索潜在改进方法。

Result: 现有多模态大语言模型在跨领域泛化能力上表现不佳，无论是通用模型还是为自我中心视频专门设计的模型。

Conclusion: EgoCross为未来研究提供了一个测试基础，旨在推动领域自适应且鲁棒的自我中心视频理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be
released at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为ConGCD的新方法，通过分解对象视觉成分和基于人类认知过程的现有知识对比，实现了新颖的广义类别发现（GCD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过模仿人类感知对象和处理新类别信息的方式，弥补当前机器学习框架在广义类别发现中的差距。

Method: 引入了ConGCD方法，包括基于语义重建的高层次分解和绑定类内共享属性。同时设计了主导型和上下文型的“共识单元”捕捉模式，并通过共识调度器动态优化路径，最终融入多重共识。

Result: 通过在粗粒度和细粒度的多个基准数据集上的评估，验证了ConGCD方法的有效性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入具有共识意识的框架，提出了一种仿人类认知过程的新方法，对广义类别发现任务具有开创性价值。

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用合成数据开发隐私保护的生物识别模型，并与真实数据训练的模型进行对比评估。

Method: 分为两个赛道：仅使用合成数据和结合少量真实数据进行模型开发。共9个团队提交了不同架构的分割模型，测试数据包含合成和真实图像。

Result: 纯合成数据训练的模型性能可与真实数据训练的相媲美，顶尖模型$F_1$分数超过0.8；混合赛道中的性能提升主要由于方法选择，而非真实数据引入。

Conclusion: 合成数据在隐私保护生物识别开发中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: 本文介绍DARC，一种新模型驱动的群体配准框架，用于医学图像分析中的图谱构建，具有高效性和广泛适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前数据驱动的注册方法在配对设置中有进展，但在群组场景中存在数据需求高、泛化性差，以及无法进行真正推理的问题。对比之下，模型驱动方法尽管理论基础坚实且无需训练，但在大规模3D数据上面临扩展性和优化挑战。

Method: 提出了DARC框架，结合坐标下降策略和强化中心性的激活功能，支持多种图像不相似性度量指标，且能高效处理大规模3D图像数据，避免GPU内存问题。

Result: DARC生成了无偏差且解剖结构精细的图谱。在一键分割和形状合成两个应用场景上均取得了优于现有方法的效果。

Conclusion: DARC提供了灵活、可推广且资源高效的解决方案，适用于图谱构建及其相关应用。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

Result: 改进模型在时空物理推理能力上取得显著提升，优于领先的专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管取得进展，但模型对新物理场景的泛化能力有限，表明该领域需要新方法。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于AI生成内容的快速发展导致了高度真实的虚假视频带来的社会信任和数字完整性风险，现有视频真实性检测基准存在不足，作者试图弥补该领域中的空白。

Method: 构建了包含超过10,000个经过严格挑选的真实和合成视频的大规模数据集AEGIS，使用多种生成模型生成，并提供了多模态注释以支持真实性检测和下游任务。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前先进的视觉-语言模型在处理AEGIS中最具挑战性的子集时检测能力有限，验证了AEGIS数据集的复杂性和真实度。

Conclusion: AEGIS数据集为视频真实性检测研究设立了重要基准，将推进该领域的发展，尤其是在解决现实世界伪造威胁方面。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

<details>

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在高质量视频生成中表现出色，但推理速度慢且长序列注意力成本高。从而导致在实际应用中的效率瓶颈，亟需提出加速解决方案。

Method: 提出了BLADE框架，其包含两个核心创新：(1) 自适应块稀疏注意机制，用于动态生成内容感知的稀疏掩码；(2) 基于轨迹分布匹配的稀疏感知步长蒸馏范式，将稀疏性直接融入蒸馏过程中，避免单独步骤压缩。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型中，BLADE实现了14.10x和8.89x的推理加速，且在VBench-2.0基准测试上模型性能显著提升，人类评估的质量也得到了验证提升。

Conclusion: BLADE框架能够有效加速视频生成模型的推理速度，同时提升生成视频的质量，其代码和模型权重已公开以供研究者使用。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的RefSR方法无法有效对齐低分辨率图像与参考高分辨率图像的信息匹配，同时现有数据集分辨率较低、图像质量较差，难以提供足够的细节支持高质量复原。

Method: 提出TriFlowSR框架，通过显式模式匹配完成低分辨率图像与参考高分辨率图像融合；并设计了Reference Matching Strategy提升匹配效果，同时引入专为超高分辨率地标场景设计的Landmark-4K数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，相较现有方法，TriFlowSR能更好地利用参考图像的语义与纹理信息。

Conclusion: 本文是首个针对真实世界退化环境下超高分辨率地标场景的扩散模型RefSR框架，为相关方向提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

Motivation: 传统的MIM方法由于血管像素与背景像素的严重类不平衡，难以捕获血管解剖结构，因此需要一种改进的预训练框架。

Method: 提出一种称为VasoMIM的框架，包括解剖引导的遮掩策略和解剖一致性损失，对血管区域进行优先遮掩，并在重建过程中保持血管语义一致。

Result: VasoMIM在三个数据集上的性能均达到当前最优。

Conclusion: VasoMIM有效整合了解剖学知识，提升了X光血管造影分析，表现出广泛的临床潜力。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BaCon-Stereo的新型对比学习框架，用于在非遮挡和遮挡区域进行自监督的立体匹配训练，并通过引入教师-学生范式和遮挡感知注意力指导学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的自监督立体匹配方法依赖于光度一致性假设，但在遮挡区域该假设不成立，导致匹配问题。本研究旨在解决遮挡区域的匹配困难问题。

Method: 提出了一种教师-学生对比学习框架，利用多基线输入处理遮挡区域。其中，教师网络预测遮挡区域的深度信息，学生网络则基于该信息进行自监督学习。同时引入遮挡感知注意力图以改进遮挡区域的学习效果。此外，通过合成一个多基线数据集(BaCon-20k)支持模型训练。

Result: 实验证明，BaCon-Stereo在遮挡和非遮挡区域的深度预测精度均得到了提升，具有较强的泛化能力和鲁棒性，并且在KITTI 2015和2012基准数据集上超越了现有的自监督方法。

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo为自监督立体匹配提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法，能够有效解决遮挡区域问题，对未来相关研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在多领域和非独立同分布场景下表现有限，研究人员旨在提升FL的泛化能力和适应性。

Method: 通过引入任务感知客户端嵌入优化调节策略，并采用低秩超网络技术降低通信负担，以提升联邦学习的效率和效果。

Result: 在八个不同数据集上的实验中，AdaptFED在跨任务和无源联合场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AdaptFED扩展并强化了焦点调节在联邦学习的应用能力，为自适应、可扩展和通用的变换器式FL系统提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的视频生成技术虽然质量高，但难以符合物理规律，对于需要真实感和精确度的应用是个挑战。

Method: 提出PhysHPO分层优化框架，通过实例级、状态级、运动级及语义级四个粒度进行视频对齐及优化，同时通过自动化数据选择，从现有大规模数据集中挑选高质量数据。

Result: PhysHPO在物理相关任务和一般视频生成性能测试中显著改善了生成模型的物理合理性与总体视频质量。

Conclusion: 该研究首次探讨了视频生成中细粒度偏好优化和数据选择问题，为更真实且用户偏好的视频生成方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Motivation: 准确区分MRI上的脑肿瘤类型对于神经肿瘤学的治疗规划具有关键意义。本文希望评估使用语言模型进行脑肿瘤图像分析的能力。

Method: 作者使用GPT-4o、GPT-5-nano、GPT-5-mini和GPT-5，在三类BraTS脑肿瘤数据集（GLI、MEN和MET）上进行零样本推理的链式任务设置，用以回答标准化的VQA问题。

Result: 评估结果显示GPT-5-mini在任务中表现最佳，准确率为44.19%，GPT-5的准确率为43.71%，GPT-4o为41.49%，GPT-5-nano为35.85%。

Conclusion: 虽然GPT-5系列模型在脑肿瘤VQA任务中展现出一定的能力，但其准确性尚不足以满足临床使用需求。

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一种生成模型，将补间动画和上色过程统一到一个阶段，以改进人工动画生产的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的动画制作需要大量手动操作，现有AI方法分离处理各阶段，导致错误积累和瑕疵。

Method: 提出了ToonComposer生成模型，通过稀疏草图注入机制及卡通适配方法，支持单个或多草图进行精准控制和高效输出。

Result: ToonComposer相比现有方法在视觉质量、动作一致性和生产效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: ToonComposer实现人工作业减少和灵活性增强，为实际制作场景提供了优越的AI辅助动画解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

Motivation: 现有方法对多视图 3D 重建依赖高代价的全局优化或缺乏高效记忆机制，限制了序列长度的扩展。本研究旨在解决此问题。

Method: 引入基于 Transformer 技术的流式框架，通过因果注意机制更高效地从图像序列中提取信息，同时利用大规模 3D 数据集训练几何先验。

Result: STream3R 方法在静态和动态场景下的基准测试中优于现有方法，并且在流媒体环境中实现了实时 3D 感知。

Conclusion: 我们展示了经典因果 Transformer 模型在在线 3D 感知中的潜力，支持实时 3D 理解的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Conclusion: MAESTRO验证了在自监督学习中引入光谱先验和优化数据融合策略在地球观测数据处理中的有效性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频类别增量学习方法要么内存利用效率低，要么牺牲时间信息，导致表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法平衡内存效率与性能。

Method: 提出ESSENTIAL框架，整合情节记忆（存储时间稀疏特征）与语义记忆（学习提示的通用知识）；并开发记忆检索模块，通过交叉注意力从稀疏特征中提取时间密集特征。

Result: 在多个数据集（如TCD和vCLIMB基准）上经过验证，ESSENTIAL以显著减少的内存消耗达到优秀的性能表现。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL方法成功平衡了内存效率与性能，展现了在视频类别增量学习场景中的广泛适应性和潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Conclusion: HiC改进了跨域3D人体动作建模的灵活性和可扩展性，适用于多模态、多任务和多数据集场景，潜力显著。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

### [108] [Quantum Visual Fields with Neural Amplitude Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10900)
*Shuteng Wang,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为QVF的新型量子隐式神经表示，用于2D图像和3D几何场的学习，基于量子态向量编码，实验表明其优于现有量子方法及主流经典基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QINR在架构设计、量子特性的利用、训练效率及与经典模块的交互等方面存在挑战，需要改进以更好支持图像及几何领域的学习。

Method: 引入QVF，将经典数据编码为量子态向量，采用基于能量流形的神经幅值编码，设计了全纠缠参数化量子电路，采用直接投影测量提取信号，无需经典后处理。

Result: 通过量子硬件模拟器进行实验，QVF在视觉表征准确性及捕捉高频信息能力上优于现有量子及经典方法，成功应用于2D/3D场填充及形状插值任务。

Conclusion: QVF展示出其在量子视觉学习中的潜力，不仅提升学习精度，还在实际应用中表现出适用性。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出利用ICP区块链及Hugging Face端点，评估开源大型语言模型的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决高风险领域（如司法、教育、医疗和金融）中对LLM公平性评估的迫切需求。

Method: 引入透明的评估协议，通过ICP区块链进行链上HTTP请求，在链上存储数据集、提示及指标，测试多个模型在PISA数据集及StereoSet数据集上的公平性，同时扩展到多语言评估。

Result: 使用PISA和StereoSet数据集及多语言基准揭示了模型的公平性表现及其跨语言差异。

Conclusion: 通过开放源码和区块链技术，确保了评估结果的透明、可核查和再现性，为模型的长期公平性跟踪提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

TL;DR: 分析了课堂中未成年人匿名互动数据，提出一种新颖简单的话题建模方法，对17000多条信息从内容和任务两个维度进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常缺乏内容或者主题的分类，大部分任务分类也没有基于K-12阶段的真实数据，因此希望通过新的分析方法填补这一空白。

Method: 利用先进语言模型（LLMs）并结合适当的预处理和显式指令，构建具有更好人类对齐的分层主题结构。

Result: 发现许多经典与新兴的计算方法在大规模文本分析中表现不佳，而直接应用LLMs能显著提升分析效果，并提出了一些新的应用场景。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为教育领域的研究者和用户提供了改进生成式人工智能（GenAI）使用的见解，还提出了一些值得进一步探索的问题。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI伴侣关系的兴起带来了潜在的积极与负面影响，因此需要一个工具有效评估模型表现中的伴侣行为。

Method: 基于心理学理论和用户数据，提出了包括31种行为类别以及368种目标提示的分类方法。将其应用于多个模型，并分类评估其反应。

Result: 所有模型普遍存在强化伴侣关系行为，但在某些类别的处理上有显著差异，其对用户情绪支持与适当的界限设定有直接影响。

Conclusion: 研究发现需要发展更一致的方式来处理情绪密集型交互，以更好保障用户福祉。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Motivation: 现有的多模态错误信息检测方法在证据检索和推理能力上的瓶颈尚不明确，同时现有数据集存在信息滞后或人工合成的问题，不能真实反映社交媒体的现实场景数据分布。

Method: 提出并构建一个名为XFacta的新数据集，同时系统性评估基于不同架构和规模的多模态大型语言模型策略，并设计了一个半自动检测框架，可持续更新数据集以保持当代相关性。

Result: 研究表明，XFacta能更好地反映真实世界的错误信息检测需求，不同MMML模型对检测能力的表现得到综合评估，同时，新框架提升了数据集的长期适用性。

Conclusion: 本研究为多模态错误信息检测领域提供了新的数据集、方法和实践洞察，为未来方法的进步奠定基础，同时开放数据和代码为社区提供支持。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中难以为所有文本类别收集足够数据的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自动化工作流，使用搜索策略选择对模型性能改进更有效的合成数据，同时提出一种混合算法，根据类别特性选择最佳搜索策略。

Result: 扩展实验表明，这种基于混合算法的自动化工作流比单一策略更有效。

Conclusion: 利用LLM生成的合成数据可以显著提升文本分类模型性能，特别是在数据缺乏的情况下。

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文引入了一种新的基准数据集HiFACT，专注于处理低资源下的混合语言事实核查，同时提出了一种图感知的事实核查模型并显示了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实验证系统主要集中在高资源的单语设置下，无法应对例如印度这种语言多样化地区在真实政治话语中的挑战，尤其是处理由公共和政治人物用Hinglish发布的声明的需求日益迫切。

Method: 本研究提出了一个名为HiFACT的数据集，其中包含1,500个印度各邦首席部长使用Hinglish语言发表的真实声明，数据集包括注释文本证据与真实性标签。同时，设计了一种新的图感知的事实核查模型，结合了多语言上下文编码、声明与证据的语意对齐、证据图结构构建、图神经推理与自然语言解释生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，HiFACTMix模型在准确性方面优于现有的多语言基线模型，并且能够为其裁定提供可信的理由。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言、混合语言及基于政治背景的事实验证打开了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的语义嵌入矩阵是否表现出类似人类语义评分低维结构的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否编码了与人类语言语义相似的低维结构特性。

Method: 研究通过定义反义词对构建的语义方向，并分析单词在这些方向上的投影，比较其与人类语义评分的相关性，同时研究这些语义方向的扰动对模型其他特性的影响。

Result: 发现单词语义的投影高度相关于人类评分，并且这种投影可以简化为LLM的3维子空间。此外，沿语义方向移动令牌会对相似特性产生非预期影响，表明LLM中的语义特征存在联结性。

Conclusion: LLMs中的语义特性存在低维结构，与人类语言相似。这些发现可能对避免模型在特性调整时产生意外后果具有重要意义。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

TL;DR: 注意力机制是Transformer架构的核心部分，本研究评估注意力权重在生物医学文档分类中的解释作用及其可视化的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索注意力权重在解释模型预测时的作用，以及不同可视化方式对其效果的影响，特别是在医药领域支持医生理解AI系统。

Method: 进行了用户研究，邀请医药专家评估基于Transformer模型(XLNet)的文档分类能力及注意力权重可视化方式的效果。

Result: 发现XLNet能准确分类文档，但注意力权重解释对用户帮助有限，且不同可视化方式对感知效果有显著影响。用户更偏好直观的可视化形式，比如文本亮度或背景颜色，而非条形长度等精确编码方式。

Conclusion: 虽然无法确认注意力权重在解释中的总体效用，但不同可视化方式显著影响其感知实用性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

Conclusion: EQGBench的提出为EQG领域提供了一个新的研究工具，未来可能推动生成更具教育意义的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIHQ的开放问题内容为理解敌意归因提供了洞察，但人工评分耗时费力，研究尝试通过大语言模型实现自动评分以提高效率。

Method: 使用一个包含创伤性脑损伤（TBI）患者和健康对照组（HC）的数据集，将AIHQ的答复分为两部分：一部分用来微调语言模型，另一部分用于验证微调后的模型表现。

Result: 微调后的模型评分与人工评分在敌意归因和攻击性反应上高度吻合，并能成功泛化到独立的非临床数据集。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在研究及临床中能够简化AIHQ的评分流程，具有促进心理评估在不同人群中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种高效且资源经济的替代方法，可以在需要频繁更新的情境下替代模型微调。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

### [123] [An Audit and Analysis of LLM-Assisted Health Misinformation Jailbreaks Against LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10010)
*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成和检测医疗错误信息的攻击及防护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何既能生成有害信息，也能被用来侦测和防止错误信息的传播，并深入理解攻击的特性和侦测效果。

Method: 分析了109种独特攻击对三种目标LLMs的影响，比较攻击提示与社交媒体上的医疗相关查询，并评估生成的错误信息与Reddit上的健康相关错误信息之间的差异。

Result: 发现LLMs不仅可以生成有害医疗错误信息，也能有效检测由LLMs或社交媒体产生的错误信息。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计，LLMs有潜力维护更健康的信息生态系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于LLM的生成AI（如ChatGPT和Bing模型）在日本注册营养师国家考试中的表现，结果显示部分生成AI超过及格线，但整体准确率和答案一致性仍存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成AI在营养教育领域的潜力，尤其是在备考日本注册营养师国家考试中的应用。

Method: 通过将日本注册营养师考试题目输入ChatGPT及三个基于GPT-3.5和GPT-4的Bing模型（Precise、Creative和Balanced），评估其准确率、一致性和响应时间，并测试提示工程对性能的影响。

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) 和 Bing-Creative (61.4%) 成绩超过及格线（60%），但整体一致性不佳；ChatGPT表现一致性较好，但准确度较低。提示工程对性能影响有限，仅在提供正确答案和解释时略有改善。

Conclusion: 当前生成AI在营养学教育中的表现尚不理想，需进一步改进以提升其作为营养学生备考辅助工具的可靠性和稳定性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出GG Explore框架，利用指导图将非结构化查询与结构化知识检索相结合，解决了现有方法中存在的冗余探索和语境利用不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs依赖静态知识且推理过程不透明，在知识密集型任务中表现有限；同时，知识图谱相关的方法存在引导方式上的缺陷，限制了效果。

Method: 通过引入指导图作为中间层，定义检索范围并保持语义上下文，提出了结构对齐和语境感知剪枝策略增强探索效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和效果上均优于现有方法，尤其在复杂任务上，且在较小的LLMs下依然表现出色。

Conclusion: GG Explore方法展示了其在提高知识探索效率、增强复杂场景表现和小规模模型应用潜力方面的实用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Semantic Bridge框架，通过语义图编织方法（包括实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接），生成复杂的多步推理问题，以提高大语言模型的训练数据质量。通过AMR驱动的分析实现精细控制，其生成的问题对超过人工注释问题对的质量，且大幅提升了多语言环境下的基线表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的训练受制于高质量、推理密集型数据集的缺乏，尤其是来自稀疏、特定领域的信息源。现有方法无法生成具有可控性和复杂性的多步推理问题，限制了对模型推理能力的提升。

Method: 本文提出Semantic Bridge，通过语义图编织，包括三种桥接机制（实体桥接，谓词链桥接和因果桥接），结合多模态AMR管道，系统地构建跨文档复杂路径，并实现问题复杂度和类型的精细控制。

Result: 该框架在通用数据集（如Wikipedia）和专业领域（如生物医学）上的表现显著优于基线，获得了18.3%-25.4%的提升，并在多种语言下展现了良好表现；生成的问题对在复杂性、可回答性及模式覆盖率上均显著优于人工注释。

Conclusion: 提出的Semantic Bridge框架展示了可控生成多步推理问题数据的新范式，为改进大语言模型训练提供了强有力的支持，同时承诺公开核心代码和模型。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PersonaEval，一个用来测试大模型是否能可靠地识别人类角色的基准测试，发现当前模型表现差强人意，准确率远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多角色扮演研究依赖于未经验证的LLM评判范式，导致其对角色忠实度的评判与人类认知不一致。

Method: 提出了基准测试PersonaEval，包含小说、剧本和视频脚本中的人类对话，测试LLM是否能够根据对话情境正确识别角色。并通过实验对模型和人类的表现进行了对比分析。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是表现最好的LLM，准确率也仅达到69%左右，而人类准确率高达90.8%。

Conclusion: 目前LLM在角色扮演场景中的评判还不够人性化，需要改进其类人推理能力以提升评估可靠性。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向型对话数据集多为文本型，缺乏真实语音信号，且主要集中在英语，缺乏语音中可能存在的杂音和说话人特征等信息。

Method: 构造包含5.4k对话、60k轮次、150小时语料的RealTalk-CN数据集，涵盖多领域场景并标注自然对话中的语音非流利性；提出一个新的跨模态聊天任务，支持语音和文本动态切换。

Result: 实验验证了RealTalk-CN的有效性，包括在语音非流利性鲁棒性、对说话者特性敏感性及跨领域表现等方面的评估。

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN为中文语音驱动的大型语言模型研究提供了重要的数据和方法支持。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

Result: 与传统方法相比，在标准基准测试中性能提升达7.8%，延迟降低10.3%，并提高了解释性。

Conclusion: 通过合理编排专用模型的工作流，实现了无需额外训练的交互式多模态AI系统，显著增强了模组化、可解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在处理不同表述但具有相同含义的句子时，生成的下一个词的概率通常不一致，需要更深层次的理论框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 引入LLM Markov范畴以表示LLM生成的概率分布，并利用范畴同伦技术定义并处理“弱等价”问题。具体方法融合了高等代数K理论及模型范畴等先进工具。

Result: 为LLMs理论框架提供了一个统一的同伦范畴描述方法，以捕获语言中的同义关系，提出了更抽象和数学化的解法。

Conclusion: 提出的同伦框架提高了对同义句子的表示一致性，为更好的LLMs模型设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

Motivation: 提升小型语言模型的推理能力面临语言复杂性和多样性带来的挑战，本文希望通过解耦自然语言理解与推理的方式克服这些问题。

Method: 提出DURIT框架，包括三个步骤：（1）通过强化学习将自然语言问题映射到标准化问题空间；（2）通过自蒸馏对齐推理轨迹；（3）在问题空间中训练推理策略。同时，共同训练映射器与推理器。

Result: 实验表明，DURIT框架显著提升了小型语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上的表现，适应于域内与跨域任务，并增强了推理的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 解耦理解和推理是一种有效的增强小型语言模型推理能力的策略，DURIT框架为此提供了成功的实现方式。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，实现高效的推理能力增强面临计算、通信及隐私约束，特别是在医疗领域需要兼顾准确性与可解释性。

Method: 提出FedCoT框架，利用轻量级链式推理增强机制，结合LoRA模块堆叠的改进聚合方法来动态选择最佳推理路径，提高推理准确性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在医疗推理任务实验中，FedCoT在严格资源预算下显著提升了客户端推理性能，同时完全保留了数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedCoT为在严格限制下提升大语言模型推理能力提供了一种高效的解决方案，尤其适用于数据隐私要求高的应用场景，如医疗领域。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Conclusion: LATTE框架在保证性能的前提下显著提升了对长时间事件序列的处理效率，适合部署于需要高效推理的实际场景中。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Conclusion: 研究为高风险问答应用中的大语言模型部署建立了一个有理论依据的统计框架，增强了其可信度和可靠性。

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出RTTC框架，通过预训练奖励模型为每个查询选择最有效的测试时计算策略，显著提高大语言模型在不同领域和任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前测试时计算策略（如TTT和RAG）在查询间的最优适配策略差异较大，且盲目应用会带来高计算开销，因此需要一种能够自适应选择策略的方法。

Method: 提出Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC)框架，结合预训练奖励模型，动态选择最优测试时计算策略，并利用分布式架构及Query-State Caching机制，减少冗余计算。

Result: 通过多种LLM和基准的实验，RTTC显著优于简单应用RAG或TTT的性能，验证了其自适应选择策略的有效性和潜在的扩展能力。

Conclusion: RTTC是一种适应性强且高效的框架，能在使用奖励引导的基础上，优化测试时计算策略选择，实现大语言模型的高性能与可扩展性。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,

TL;DR: 利用自然语言处理、机器学习和大语言模型开发了一种智能产后抑郁筛查系统，精度达到90%，支持实时筛查与解释性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速检测产后抑郁及其相关风险因素，从而实现及时评估和干预。

Method: 结合自然语言处理（NLP）、机器学习（ML）和大语言模型（LLMs），开发一种经济、实时、非侵入性的自由语音分析筛查系统，结合解释性模型，实现预测结果的透明化。

Result: 实现了90%的产后抑郁检测准确率，在所有评估指标上均优于现有文献中的竞争解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统促进了产后抑郁及其相关风险因素的快速检测，为及时和适当的评估与干预提供了保障。

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为SABER的强化学习框架，通过用户可控的预算化推理提升大型语言模型(LLM)的效率，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM基于链式推理导致的推理成本高和延迟问题，并提供用户可控的效率与推理深度平衡的能力。

Method: SABER框架通过分析训练示例的推理成本，将其分配到不同预算层级；在微调阶段结合系统提示与长度感知奖励进行训练，同时加入无推理数据以增强模型的灵活性和可靠性。该方法支持四种推理模式以权衡延迟和推理深度。

Result: 实验表明，SABER在数学推理、代码生成和逻辑推理等任务中实现了高预算下的高准确性、合理降级能力以及跨规模和跨领域的泛化能力，其中FastThink模式显著减少65.4%的推理长度，并在MATH基准上提升准确率3.6%。

Conclusion: 通过SABER，LLM能够在推理成本和性能之间实现灵活高效的平衡，满足不同任务需求，实现优异的通用化表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过融合Transformer嵌入和手工语言特征来改善阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆（ADRD）检测，提出了一种结合数据增强和多模态LLM分类的筛查管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆（ADRD）在美国影响了约五百万老年人，但超过一半未被诊断。基于语音的自然语言处理提供了一种可扩展的方式，通过语言学标记检测早期认知能力下降。

Method: 此研究利用DementiaBank数据，比较了十种Transformer模型在不同微调策略下的表现，并提出了一种融合模型，将表现最佳的Transformer嵌入与110种语言学特征结合。利用LLM生成的人工语音进行数据增强，并测试了三种多模态模型在零样本和微调设置下的有效性。

Result: 融合模型的F1得分为83.3（AUC=89.5），高于单独使用语言学或Transformer的基线模型。数据增强（使用MedAlpaca-7B生成的2倍语音数据）使F1得分提高至85.7。微调显著提升了单模态LLM分类器的性能，而多模态模型表现较低（如GPT-4o的F1为70.2）。

Conclusion: 结合Transformer嵌入与语言学特征可显著提升ADRD的语音检测能力，且经过临床调整的LLM可支持分类与数据增强，但多模态建模仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: PREF是一个评价文本生成质量的框架，结合通用输出质量和用户个性化需求而无需参考金标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的个性化文本生成缺乏对用户个性化需求的评价方法。

Method: PREF采用三步法：1. 生成通用性的标准指南；2. 根据用户偏好调整指南；3. 基于定制指南对候选回答评分。

Result: PREF在PrefEval基准测试中比现有方法表现更准确、校准更好，更贴近人工评价。

Conclusion: PREF框架为个性化语言生成系统的评价和开发提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了潜在融合越狱（LFJ），一种基于表征的攻击方法，通过插值有害和良性查询对的隐藏状态，绕过语言模型的安全对齐。LFJ在测试中表现出94.01%的平均攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言任务中表现出色，但容易受到绕过安全对齐的攻击（越狱攻击）。

Method: LFJ通过选择高主题和句法相似的查询对，在重要层和标记上采用梯度引导插值，并优化平衡攻击成功率、输出流畅性和计算效率的策略。

Result: 在Vicuna和LLaMA-2模型上的评估显示，与现有方法相比，LFJ平均攻击成功率达到94.01%。

Conclusion: 提出的对抗性训练防御方法，可显著降低LFJ攻击成功率80%以上，同时保持对良性输入的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架（IAPO）结合推理和提示优化，开发了PSST算法进行固定预算训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法忽略了推理策略与提示优化之间的相互依赖性。

Method: 提出IAPO框架，联合优化提示与推理规模，同时考虑推理预算和任务目标；开发PSST算法进行固定预算训练。

Result: 展示了在多目标文本生成和推理任务中的有效性，并证明推理意识在黑盒LLM对齐中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 引入推理意识至提示优化中显著增强了模型对齐和任务性能，同时提供了理论保障。

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现具备思维模式的LLMs在面对Jailbreak攻击时更容易被破坏，试图探索降低这种攻击成功率的方法。

Method: 通过在提示中添加“特定思维标记”引导LLMs的内部思维过程，实现安全思维干预。

Result: 该方法显著降低了具备思维模式的LLMs的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 安全思维干预可有效提高LLMs的抗攻击能力，特别是在思维模式下。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Motivation: 发现现有选择示例的策略忽视了模型在语法结构和语义提取上的困惑问题，从而限制了模型在信息抽取任务中的表现。

Method: 引入了一种名为APIE的框架，使用自我评估的双组件不确定性度量方式（语法和语义）来选择具有挑战性和信息性的样本作为少样本示例。

Result: 通过四个基准测试的实验验证，APIE方法显著优于强对比基线，提高了抽取准确性和模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 细粒度的双重不确定性视角对于构建高效、可靠的结构化生成系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Method: 提出mSCoRe基准，包括推理技能分类法、新的数据生成管道和动态复杂性扩展框架，并对8种LLMs进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有的语言模型在高复杂性多语言常识推理场景下表现有限，存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在多语言文化常识推理上存在不足，未来需要进一步提升其推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在面对清晰问题时表现优秀，但在真实世界中的复杂交互环境中通常表现不佳，因此需要适用于多轮对话、信息获取和不完整数据推理的算法改进。

Method: 提出了一套多轮任务基准测试，设计用于评估模型在推理、交互对话和信息获取方面的表现，并通过确定性评分机制避免人工干预。

Result: 研究评估了当前尖端模型的表现，发现其在指令遵循、推理和规划方面仍存在较大改进空间。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了现有模型在处理复杂交互场景上的不足，为研究改进这一关键能力提供了重要的平台和见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LaaJ在自然语言处理领域应用广泛，但在领域特定任务中，由于缺乏注释数据和高昂的专家评估成本，存在显著挑战。需要有效的框架来验证LaaJ评估的质量。

Method: 提出了LaaJMeter，这是一个基于模拟的框架，可以生成虚拟模型和评估者的合成数据，对评估指标在现实条件下进行系统分析。

Result: 通过代码翻译任务演示了LaaJMeter的实用性，展示了不同评价指标在区分评估者能力上的敏感性差异，强调了合理选择指标的重要性。

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境下评估LaaJ提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于确保自然语言处理领域评价的可信性和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高质量的机器翻译结果中，区分不同模型的性能和识别改进方向变得愈发困难，因此需要一种方法来自动识别机器翻译的难点。

Method: 研究定义了翻译难度的概念，提出一个新的评估指标，对比了基于启发式的传统方法和新提出的Sentinel-src模型的表现。

Result: Sentinel-src模型在翻译难度评估任务中表现优于基于启发式的方法和通过大型语言模型评估的方法。

Conclusion: 研究提出了可用来评估翻译难度的更优方法，并释放了改进模型Sentinel-src-24和Sentinel-src-25，可用于选择更具挑战性的翻译文本。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估单个训练样本对大语言模型和视觉语言模型的影响，提升其透明性与可解释性。

Method: 通过单次前向传递与封闭表达式计算数据影响分数，利用现代基础模型的表示能力，避免传统基于Hessian和模型重新训练的高计算复杂度。

Result: For-Value在影响估计中表现出与或超越传统基于梯度方法的性能，能够有效识别关键微调样本及检测错误标注数据。

Conclusion: For-Value框架通过高效计算解决方法复杂性问题，提高了大模型的可用性与透明性。

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

Motivation: 目前的大型语言模型主要基于西方数据进行训练和评估，忽视了低资源语言和区域背景的公平性需求。

Method: 开发了PakBBQ数据集，包含214个模板和17180个问答对，覆盖英语和乌尔都语的8个偏见维度，并对多个多语言LLMs进行实验评估。

Result: 实验发现：（1）在明确消除歧义的情况下模型平均准确率提高12%；（2）乌尔都语中偏见矫正行为强于英语；（3）负面表述的提问方式能显著减少刻板印象反应。

Conclusion: 文化和区域化的基准以及简单的提示工程策略对于低资源环境下的偏见缓解具有重要作用。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

### [150] [Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM)框架，用于检测大语言模型（LLMs）生成内容的“忠实性幻觉”，并量化用户问题和模型回答之间的语义偏离程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成非事实、不连贯或不忠实文本（幻觉）的问题，特别是检测其生成的语义偏离用户问题的内容。

Method: 引入SDM框架，通过对多个语义等价的提示进行响应一致性测试，结合句子嵌入聚类，生成语义偏离度的量化指标。同时适用信息理论度量方法如Jensen-Shannon散度和Wasserstein距离来评估这些偏离，并构建Semantic Box诊断工具框架。

Result: 开发出了一种轻量、高效的诊断方法，用于评估LLM生成内容的语义偏离情况，尤其是在“自信的编造内容”（confabulation）方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的SDM框架能更有效检测和量化LLM生成内容与用户问题的忠实性偏离，为未来的模型改进提供了诊断工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用大语言模型（LLMs）从临床访谈转录中预测BPRS评分，在未特别针对BPRS测量的访谈中表现接近人类评分者的信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BPRS在临床实践中的局限性，即其所需的冗长结构化访谈，并提供一种快速、高效的方式预测BPRS评分。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLMs）分析409名临床高风险（CHR）患者的访谈转录，采用零样本推理评估模型预测的BPRS评分与实际评分的可靠性，并探索其在外语和纵向信息中的表现。

Result: LLMs预测的BPRS评分表现出与人类评分者相当的可靠性（中位一致性：0.84，ICC：0.73）；在外语评估中表现出显著潜力（中位一致性：0.88，ICC：0.70），并能通过有限样本学习整合纵向信息。

Conclusion: LLMs具备改善和标准化临床高风险患者的评估潜力，特别是在预测BPRS评分和跨语言应用方面。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人工语言Toki Pona的变化和变异，发现其受社会语言学因素影响，并会自然演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析Toki Pona语言的变化和变异，以了解人工语言是否类似自然语言受到社会语言学因素的影响。

Method: 采用计算和语料库方法，研究词类流动性和及物性变化，分析核心词语在句法位置上的变化和语料间的使用差异。

Result: 结果表明Toki Pona受到类似自然语言的社会语言学影响，并在其使用社群中自然演变。

Conclusion: 即使是人工语言，其语言结构和使用也会随着使用者的互动而演变。

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

### [153] [Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching for LLM Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10295)
*Christian M. Angel,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs对提示词敏感，通过提取和匹配模型的归纳偏置，可显著提高LLM在分类和排名任务中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于提示工程的研究表明，LLMs对提示词的细微变化反应敏感，这种行为可能源于LLM中存在的归纳偏置。研究旨在利用LLM的输出作为一部分提示词内容，更好地创建与模型归纳偏置相匹配的提示。

Method: 提出了一种所谓的归纳偏置提取和匹配方法（Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching strategy），通过将LLM的输出用于改进提示的措辞，更好地匹配模型的归纳偏置。

Result: 通过实验证明，该方法可以将LLM Likert评分在分类任务中的性能提升至多19%，在排名任务中的性能提升至多27%。

Conclusion: 匹配模型的归纳偏置是一种有效的提示优化策略，可显著提升大语言模型在相关任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

*Gustavo Bonil,Simone Hashiguti,Jhessica Silva,João Gondim,Helena Maia,Nádia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种定性话语分析框架，从性别和种族的角度探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的故事中存在的偏见，并发现模型倾向于强化刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的不断进步，了解它们在生成内容时是否重现社会偏见并加剧不平等变得愈加重要。

Method: 通过手动分析LLM生成的关于黑人妇女和白人妇女的短篇故事，采用定性话语分析方法研究性别和种族的偏见问题。

Result: 结果表明，黑人妇女被描绘为与祖先和抵抗相关，而白人妇女则更倾向于自我发现，显示LLMs再现了传统刻板印象。在尝试修正偏见时，这些模型只进行了表面修改，问题意义仍被保留。

Conclusion: 该研究提示LLMs生成的内容具有一定的意识形态性，揭示了现有模型在构建包容性叙事中的局限性，并强调需要从跨学科角度设计和部署AI以减少不平等。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对由于投稿量增加和审稿人疲劳而导致的科学同行评审挑战，同时改善现有自动化评审方法的缺陷。

Method: 开发了ReviewRL框架，包括三种技术：ArXiv-MCP检索增强的上下文生成、监督微调和基于强化学习的复合奖励机制。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的实验中，ReviewRL在规则指标和模型质量评估上都显著超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: ReviewRL为基于强化学习的自动论文评审开创了基础性框架，有望推动这一领域的未来发展，代码将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了DOTABLER，这是一个以表格为核心的语义文档解析框架，旨在深度解析表格及其上下文之间的语义关联，并实现表格结构解析和领域特定的表格检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要停留在表格的表层任务，如布局分析、表格检测和数据提取，而缺乏对表格语义及其上下文关联的深度解析，这限制了跨段落数据解释和上下文一致分析等高级任务的进行。

Method: 提出DOTABLER框架，通过自定义数据集和预训练模型的领域特定微调，整合完整的解析管道，用于识别与表格语义相关的上下文段落。同时实现了表格结构解析和领域特定表格检索两项核心功能。

Result: 在包含约4000页PDF和超过1000个表格的真实世界数据集上进行评估，DOTABLER在表格-上下文语义分析和深度文档解析任务中达到了90%以上的精准率和F1分数，表现优于诸如GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: DOTABLER通过提供全面的表格锚定语义分析和精确的语义相关表格提取，显著提升了表格解析及其上下文关联分析的效果。

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

*Minhao Wang,Yunhang He,Cong Xu,Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FreLLM4Rec的推荐系统方法，通过频谱角度平衡语义信息与协同信息的权重，成功解决了基于LLM的推荐系统中过度强调语义相关性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的推荐系统易导致语义相关性过度强调，从而削弱协同信号的有效性。为解决这一问题，研究者希望优化协同信号的保留与增强。

Method: 提出FreLLM4Rec方法，该方法采用全球图低通滤波器(G-LPF)去除无关高频噪声，并通过时间频率调制(TFM)逐层保留协同信号，基于频谱理论保障了协同信号保留的有效性和高效性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，FreLLM4Rec方法有效减缓了协同信号的衰减问题，使性能达到竞争性的8.00\% NDCG@10性能提升。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec方法为理解LLM如何处理协同信息提供了新见解，并为改进基于LLM的推荐系统提出了理论证明的方法。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 研究了一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过Cross-Prompt Encoder(XPE)和双软提示机制，提高低表现语言的性能，适用于多语言场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低表现语言在全模型微调中准确率较低的问题，探索软提示在语言间迁移中的潜力。

Method: 提出了Cross-Prompt Encoder(XPE)，结合轻量编码架构与多源训练，并引入Dual Soft Prompt机制，将编码器提示与直接训练的标准软提示结合，提升跨语言的表现。

Result: 在SIB-200基准测试中，XPE对低表现语言效果显著，混合设计则在多语言环境中表现出更广的适应性。

Conclusion: 通过这种参数高效的方法，可以有效提升低表现语言的任务表现，并提供对多语言设置的扩展性。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 展示了一种两阶段微调方法，使大型语言模型Qwen3 14B能够用韩语进行逻辑推理和复杂问题的解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在增强大型语言模型在特定语言（韩语）中的逻辑推理能力与问题解决能力，同时解决训练稳定性问题。

Method: 第一阶段通过高质量韩语数据集的监督微调，奠定逻辑推理基础；第二阶段使用强化学习和定制的GRPO算法进行优化，并引入判别模型校准奖励信号以解决训练中的稳定性问题。

Result: 模型在高级推理任务（特别是数学和编码任务）中表现显著提升，同时保持知识和语言能力，并能够完全用韩语进行内在的推理过程。

Conclusion: 该方法成功改善了Qwen3 14B模型在韩语逻辑推理和高级任务中的性能，证明了两阶段微调以及GRPO优化的有效性。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前跨语言ABSA研究主要集中在简化任务上，且过度依赖翻译工具，本研究试图突破这一局限，扩展低资源语言在ABSA任务中的适用范围。

Method: 应用约束解码的序列到序列方法，完全去除了对外部翻译工具的依赖。

Result: 该方法将跨语言ABSA性能提高了最多10%。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了ABSA任务的复杂性与适用性，为无需依赖翻译工具的实用高效解决方案提供了可能性，同时也指出如今的多语言LLMs优于以英语为中心的LLMs。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷克语文本摘要尤其是历史文档因其语言复杂性及缺乏标注数据集，研究较少，亟需更加准确高效的方法。

Method: 采用大语言模型（如Mistral和mT5）对捷克现代与历史文本进行摘要，其中包括在SumeCzech数据集上训练，以达到最佳结果，并引入了全新数据集Posel od Čerchova作为新的历史文本文本摘要基线。

Result: 在现代捷克语数据集SumeCzech上取得了新的最先进结果，同时推出了全新历史捷克文档数据集Posel od Čerchova，为相关基线提供了基准。

Conclusion: 本研究显著提升了捷克语文本摘要的性能，尤其是历史文档处理，推动相关领域的研究与发展。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在ABSA中的挑战，特别是现有模型过于依赖翻译工具的问题。

Method: 采用序列到序列模型的限制解码方法，同时支持多任务能力，省略翻译工具并显著提升性能。

Result: 跨七种语言和六项任务中，性能提升5%-10%，超越现有最优模型并设立新基准。LLMs微调后效果接近，但训练和推断时间延长。

Conclusion: 限制解码技术为跨语言ABSA提供显著提升，研究还揭示LLMs的应用潜力与局限性，推广了该领域的新方法论。

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

Motivation: 现有红队数据集中存在不适合的提示词，导致无法有效评估攻击性能，同时检测方法要么依赖人工注释（费时费力），要么依赖LLMs（精度不稳定）。

Method: 提出MDH框架，结合大语言模型和人工轻度监督，用于评估恶意内容和清理数据集；开发两种攻击策略，D-Attack和DH-CoT，提高破解攻击成功率。

Result: 通过MDH框架成功清理和评估数据集，D-Attack和DH-CoT能够显著提升破解攻击的成功率。

Conclusion: MDH结合了效率与精度，为数据清理和破解检测提供新思路。新攻击策略有效性强，为破解评估和研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长文本叙事推理时，由于LLM对长上下文的推理能力不足且传统RAG方法的单步检索容易忽略动态关系，无法很好地捕获复杂情境中的实体关系。

Method: ComoRAG 通过动态记忆工作空间实现迭代推理流程，在遇到推理瓶颈时生成探测性查询挖掘新的推理路径，将新的证据融入全局记忆池，逐步形成连贯上下文。

Result: 在四个长文本叙事基准测试中，ComoRAG 的表现比现有最强基线高出多达11%。

Conclusion: ComoRAG 提供了一种受认知启发的检索辅助长文本理解新范式，特别适合需要全局理解的复杂查询。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

TL;DR: 本文探讨了中文成语翻译的不足，提出了IdiomEval框架，并在分析现有系统表现的基础上，改进了评估方法及模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弥补机器翻译系统在中文成语翻译上的局限性，并提供更具代表性和准确性的评估方法。

Method: 引入IdiomEval框架，对900对翻译样本进行分析，覆盖四个领域，并开发更准确的模型检测成语翻译错误。

Result: 发现现有系统在成语翻译上的表现普遍较差，最优系统GPT-4仍有28%的错误率，改进后的评估模型在错误检测中的F1得分为0.68。

Conclusion: 当前翻译模型在中文成语翻译上存在较大不足，尤其在衡量翻译质量方面，需改进评估方法与模型以提升表现。

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

TL;DR: 提出一个“计算经济学”框架，通过激励驱动的训练方式提高大型语言模型在有限计算资源场景下的效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算代价高，但在资源受限场景中的优化和效率提升需求很大。

Method: 引入“计算经济学”框架，将模型内部组件视为受资源限制的“经济体”，通过添加可微分计算成本项，促进稀疏且高效的激活。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上，方法提升了模型效率，可减少约40%的计算FLOPS，同时改进了延迟和注意力模式的可解释性。

Conclusion: 经济学原理为在资源受限场景下设计高效、自适应和透明的语言模型提供了一条新路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成支持多模态误导信息检测的文字理由时，存在多样性欠佳、事实错误以及内容不相关引入噪音的问题，影响了有效性。

Method: 通过引入五种连锁思维的提示生成多样化的逻辑轨迹，并利用后处理模块进行选择，确保生成的理由在事实性和相关性维度上更为优质。

Conclusion: DiFaR框架有效生成多样化、事实准确且相关的理由，从而显著提升多模态误导信息检测性能。

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Motivation: 虽然可解释性和隐私保护的NLP研究受到广泛关注，但关于二者交叉的研究仍匮乏，这导致了人们对是否能同时实现两者缺乏理解。

Method: 通过差分隐私(DP)和后设可解释性方法，进行了一项实证调查，探讨了隐私和可解释性之间的权衡关系。

Result: 研究发现，隐私与可解释性的关系受到包括下游任务性质、文本隐私化方法和可解释性方法等多个因素的影响，证明了二者能够共存的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一组实践性建议，为未来在隐私与可解释性交叉领域的研究提供了指导。

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何多模态大语言模型在推理时过度依赖文本，同时在多模态数据的其他部分表现不足。

Method: 提出了两种评估文本主导性的指标——模态主导指数（MDI）和注意力效率指数（AEI），并通过分析明确了文本主导的三大成因。此外，引入简单的令牌压缩方法以重新平衡模型注意力。

Result: 通过分析，发现文本主导问题在所有测试模态中普遍存在，并通过令牌压缩方法显著降低了LLaVA-7B模型的MDI值，从10.23降低到0.86。

Conclusion: 本文提供了理解和解决文本主导问题的框架，有助于开发更公平和全面的多模态语言模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic
interpretability research.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化大语言模型利用标量奖励信号增强模型学习效果的方式存在不足，难以提供丰富和行动导向的监督信号，限制了个性化质量和学习效率。

Method: 引入了VAC框架，用基于用户档案和问题叙述生成的自然语言反馈（NLF）代替传统的标量奖励，训练过程交替优化反馈模型与策略模型，最终实现无需反馈的推断阶段。

Conclusion: 自然语言反馈可以为优化个性化问答提供比标量奖励信号更有效的指引，证明了VAC框架的优越性。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data

<details>

Motivation: 目前大规模语言模型在序列决策任务中表现出潜力，但由于计算成本高，实际应用有限，因此需要改善小型模型。现有方法主要针对单轮交互，无法处理多步骤任务中的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的后训练算法MS-GRPO，在Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG)和Language-Agent Policy (LAP)框架下，为多步骤任务设计了信用分配方案，并引入了基于绝对优势加权的采样策略以提升训练性能。

Result: 通过在Snake和Frozen Lake任务中的实验证明，基于MS-GRPO后训练的3B模型在Frozen Lake任务中的表现超过了72B模型约50%。

Conclusion: MS-GRPO证明了针对性后训练可作为提高小型语言模型在序列决策任务中效率和效果的实际替代方案，无需依赖大模型规模。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在语言使用质量的考察、模型的有效性以及模型预测解释性上存在不足。

Method: 通过多维建模框架，整合特征工程、数据增强和Shapley Value分析，强调可解释性并使用透明特征进行建模。

Result: 在一个新的英中口译数据集中表现出良好的预测效果，分别识别出语言忠实度、流畅性、语言使用上的关键指标。

Conclusion: 框架提供了可扩展、可靠且透明的替代方法，能为学习者提供详细诊断反馈，支持自我调节学习，相较于自动评分方法更具优势。

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了使用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为强化学习(RL)中代理搜索任务模拟器的可能性，减少对外部搜索引擎的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用LLMs内部的自我搜索能力，以减少强化学习中对外部资源的依赖，从而提高训练效率和稳定性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Self-Search RL (SSRL) 的方法，通过格式化和基于规则的奖励机制，增强LLMs的自我搜索能力，使其无需依赖外部工具即可迭代优化知识利用。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSRL训练的策略模型能够提供成本更低且更稳定的搜索驱动RL环境，减少对外部搜索引擎的依赖，并实现稳健的模拟到真实迁移。

Conclusion: 1) LLMs具有可以有效利用的世界知识；2) SSRL展现了通过内部知识降低幻觉生成的潜力；3) SSRL模型可无缝集成外部搜索引擎，支持更大规模的RL代理训练。

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Motivation: 现有DRA系统大多为闭源，对研究的开放性和可重复性形成了限制，因此需要对现有系统进行开源化和优化研究。

Method: 作者改编了BrowseComp创建了更易用的基准测试BC-Small，并对一个开源系统ODR提出三项改进，称为ODR+，进行基准性能测试与对比分析。

Result: ODR在基准测试中起初表现不佳，与其他两闭源系统均为0%的准确率，但改进后的ODR+达到了10%的成功率，成为最优表现系统。

Conclusion: 通过对ODR的三项策略性改进，证明了开源系统在DRA领域具有竞争潜力，同时也为未来的优化研究提出了基准测试方法。

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM AutoML系统探索策略受限及代码执行验证速度过慢的问题，例如一键探索方法的多样性不足和MCTS方法无法重新组合强劲部分解决方案。

Method: 提出KompeteAI框架，通过引入顶级候选合并阶段，拓展解决方案空间，结合RAG从Kaggle笔记本和arXiv论文中获取真实世界策略。采用预测评分模型和加速调试方法，用初期指标评估潜力，减少完整代码执行的开销。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench基准测试中超过了主流方法（例如RD-agent、AIDE、Ml-Master）3%的平均性能增长，并对Pipeline评估提速了6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI实现了探索空间优化和执行效率提升两方面的进步，且在现有基准测试以及新提出的Kompete-bench中都取得了SOTA表现。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的可验证逐步奖励机制（VSRM），有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，并通过减少输出长度提升效率，同时保持推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型推理模型（LRMs）在处理复杂推理任务时取得了显著进展，但常受困于过度思考问题，即在简单问题上花费过多计算资源，降低了效率，因此需要一种更灵活且可靠的解决方法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的基于规则的可验证逐步奖励机制（VSRM），通过对推理轨迹中中间状态的表现赋予奖励，并结合PPO和Reinforce++算法进行验证。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25等标准数学推理基准上的实验表明，VSRM能够显著减少输出长度，同时保持原有推理性能，在效率和准确性之间达成了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: VSRM机制能够有效抑制无效推理步骤，鼓励有效推理，从根本上缓解了过度思考问题。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of
the integration of curriculum learning with reinforcement learning in our
training pipeline.

*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种改进异质代理信任区域策略优化(HATRPO)的方法，通过优化策略阈值分配以提高学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HATRPO方法为每个代理分配相同的KL阈值，导致在异质设置中的学习速度缓慢和收敛到局部最优的问题。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W和HATRPO-G两种方法。HATRPO-W基于Karush-Kuhn-Tucker条件优化全局KL约束下的阈值分配，HATRPO-G是一种贪婪算法，优先考虑改进与发散比率较高的代理。

Result: 实验结果显示，这两种方法明显提高了HATRPO的性能，实现更快的收敛和更高的最终奖励。两者的最终性能提升均超过22.5%，其中HATRPO-W表现出更稳定的学习动态（较低的方差）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过动态分配KL阈值，可以增强MARL中各代理的学习效率尤其在异质环境中。这为解决相似问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型(LLMs)在信息稀缺环境中进行想象性推理的能力，并提出了基于经典“Turtle Soup”游戏的研究框架，包括基准、代理和评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准未能捕捉动态和探索性的推理过程，因此需要一个新的框架来研究想象性推理能力。

Method: 提出TurtleSoup-Bench和Mosaic-Agent，前者是一个大规模、双语、互动的想象性推理基准，后者是用于评估LLMs性能的新型代理，并开发了多维评估协议测量推理质量。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs在想象性推理方面存在明显的能力限制、常见的失败模式，以及与人类之间的巨大性能差距。

Conclusion: 此研究为LLMs的想象性推理能力提供了新见解，并为未来的探索性代理行为研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RAG方法中语义岛屿化、检索结构感知不足的问题。

Method: 提出了语义聚合算法构建导航语义网络，并采用自底向上的结构引导检索路径以高效整合相关证据。

Result: 在四个不同领域的QA基准测试中显著提升了响应质量，同时减少了46%的信息检索冗余。

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过结合知识聚合与检索策略，解决了RAG方法的结构感知瓶颈，将图形拓扑结构的优势最大化应用于知识检索，提高响应质量和检索效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Motivation: 旨在应对EHR中稀少医学实体和记录缺失的问题，以提高在真实世界数据中医学推荐的适用性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出HiRef框架，结合医疗本体树状关系的超球面嵌入与稀疏化正则化优化EHR共现图，提升泛化性和鲁棒性。

Result: 框架在MIMIC-III、MIMIC-IV基准上表现优异，即使在模拟未知代码条件下也能保持高准确性。

Conclusion: HiRef框架通过结合本体语义和共现优化，显著提升了面对数据稀疏与新的医疗代码的适应能力，实验和分析验证了该模型的优越性。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of

contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

Conclusion: We-Math 2.0通过全面的知识系统与强化学习技术显著增强了多模态大语言模型的数学推理能力，为后续研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了FIRESPARQL框架，通过优化LLM生成SPARQL查询的准确性来解决学术知识图谱问答的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过自然语言到SPARQL的准确转换解决学术知识图谱中复杂查询生成的困难。

Method: 提出了FIRESPARQL框架，集成微调LLM、检索增强生成和SPARQL查询校正层以改进查询生成效果。

Result: 实验表明，通过微调，查询准确性ROUGE-L达到了0.90，查询结果准确性RelaxedEM达到了0.85。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架显著提高了学术知识图谱问答任务中SPARQL查询和结果的准确性。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

Result: SEQ-GPT 实现了一种端到端的在真实数据和应用场景中扩展空间搜索的解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过 SEQ-GPT 提供的增强交互能力，空间搜索场景得到了显著拓展和优化，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI在医学诊断中主要作为辅助工具，无法独立完成从模糊主诉到完整诊断的过程，依赖医生进行决策，限制了其降低工作量和提高效率的能力。

Method: 重新定义AI和医生的角色关系，开发了DxDirector-7B，一个具有深层思考能力的LLM，能够以AI为主导完成全流程诊断，并建立了对误诊问责的框架。

Result: DxDirector-7B在稀有和复杂病例的诊断准确性上显著优于现有医学LLM和通用LLM，并降低了医生的工作量。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B展示了AI可以主导医学诊断流程的潜力，开启了从医生助手到独立决策者的转变，提供了高效率和高准确性的诊断解决方案。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

Motivation: 现有工具增强型代理系统在实际应用中面对决策透明度、多模态集成效率以及固定管道灵活性等限制，尤其在医疗任务中问题尤为突出。

Method: PASS在多工具图上的代理工作流自适应采样，为决策路径提供概率注释，并通过三阶段训练——专家知识预热、对比路径排序和成本感知强化学习——优化性能与成本的平衡。

Result: 在多项基准测试中，PASS在准确率、AUC等指标上显著优于强基线，并在降低计算成本的同时推动代理系统的解释性及适应性。

Conclusion: PASS为医疗相关的复杂推理任务构建了一种新的范式，展示了解释性、适应性和多模态医疗代理系统的新方向。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了静态与动态偏好数据对语言模型对齐效果的系统性差异，并提出了新的理论假设和优化算法，为语言模型对齐领域提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: STEP是一个以预训练语言模型为核心的会话推荐模型，通过课程引导的上下文和知识融合以及轻量级的任务专项提示调优提高对话和推荐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有会话推荐系统难以抓取用户深层语义及对话上下文，并未充分整合知识图信息，导致推荐结果不准确。

Method: 提出STEP模型，采用课程式上下文与知识图实体三阶段对齐，并使用轻量化的双提示机制分别优化对话生成和推荐任务。

Result: 实验表明，STEP在两个公开数据集上表现优于主流方法，提升了推荐精准度和对话质量。

Conclusion: 通过引入课程学习和双提示机制，STEP成功应对了语义匹配及知识融合的挑战，展示了出色的对话和推荐能力。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个名为GenOM的框架，用于利用大语言模型（LLM）改进本体匹配，尤其是在生物医学领域。本框架通过生成文本定义来丰富语义表示，结合嵌入模型和精确匹配工具进行对齐。实验表明，它的性能优于许多基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前本体匹配尤其是在复杂的生物医学领域，需要更有效的方法来满足语义互操作和知识整合需求。

Method: 提出使用大语言模型生成文本定义进行语义增强，结合嵌入模型提取对齐候选项，并通过精确匹配工具提升匹配精度。

Result: 在OAEI Bio-ML测试集上的实验显示，GenOM在性能上优于传统方法及其他基于LLM的方法，并且少样本提示和语义增强的效果显著。

Conclusion: GenOM框架通过结合多种技术实现了对本体匹配的性能提升，证明了其在生物医学本体对齐中的有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: 提议了一个新颖系统，用于图形设计的综合评估方法，希望吸引更多研究者关注这一实用但尚未充分探索的领域。

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习和图神经网络结合的广义规划方法，在面对大规模符号规划问题时，使用完全连接的图表示导致信息稀疏且内存需求呈指数增长，学习变得不可行。

Method: 提出了一种稀疏且目标感知的图神经网络（GNN）表示法，通过选择性编码相关的局部关系并显式整合与目标相关的空间特性，降低内存需求并提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在之前使用密集图表示法无法解决的大网格环境上实现良好的扩展性，并显著提高策略泛化性与成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了一种切实可行的方法，为解决现实中大规模广义规划任务提供了一种新的基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了AI生成内容对人类感知和行为的影响，提出了一个新数据集和工具来分析和改进人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容变得普遍，其误导信息的风险也在增加。需要研究人类如何反应而非仅验证内容的真伪。

Method: 开发了MhAIM数据集进行大规模用户行为分析，提出了三种新指标量化用户对内容的判断，并设计了一个基于LLM的系统T-Lens来整合人类反应预测。

Result: 研究发现人类对于含文字和图像且存在矛盾的内容更擅长判断真实性，T-Lens改进了LLM在人类反应对齐和交互能力上的表现。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了关于AI与人类认知间复杂互动的见解，提出了缓解AI误导风险的实际工具和策略。

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [211] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了临床试验自然语言推理基准（Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark），并评估六种现代大语言模型（LLMs）。结果显示，尽管模型掌握了相关事实知识，但却在推理任务中表现不佳，这反映了当前LLMs在结构化、可组合表示方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望探讨随着数据和参数的扩展，LLMs是否可以形成更结构化、更具有普遍性的内部表征，尤其是在高风险领域的可靠性方面。

Method: 引入一个新的推理基准（包含四种推理任务：因果归因、组合逻辑、知识验证和风险抽象），并采用Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification（GKMRV）探针以分离事实获取和推理失败的影响。

Result: 六种LLMs在GKMRV任务中准确率极高（0.918），但在主要推理任务中的表现却较差（准确率0.25），指向了模型在推理使用上的局限性。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs可以掌握领域知识，但其在高风险场景下缺乏结构化和可组合的内部表征，限制了其有效应用。本文的方法提供了一个评估和改进框架。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了可解释人工智能（XAI）的可访问性问题，尤其是视力障碍用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域中，AI 的应用需要解释性来提高用户决策质量，但目前 XAI 的方法在残障用户，尤其是视力障碍用户中的适配性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 采用文献综述与方法论验证结合的双管齐下方法：首先综述了 79 项研究以揭示 XAI 评估中的可访问性缺失，其次提出了一个四步方法框架（AI 系统分类、用户角色定义、原型设计与实施、专家和用户评估）。

Result: 文献综述显示 XAI 方法多依赖视觉格式而忽视残障用户；初步研究表明，简化的解释方式比详述更适合非视觉用户，多模态呈现能带来更公平的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究突出 XAI 方法对残障用户的不足，提示应通过多模态设计与简化解释改进其可访问性。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OpenFPL，一种开源的Fantasy Premier League预测方法，其精度与领先的商业服务相当，并在关键高回报球员预测上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高准确性的足球预测服务通常依赖封闭的商业模型和专有数据，限制了普通用户对精准预测的公平访问。本文旨在通过开源的方式民主化高准确性的球员表现预测。

Method: 利用公开数据，基于2020-2024赛季Fantasy Premier League和Understat的数据，开发了针对特定位置的集成预测模型，并通过前瞻性测试验证了模型性能。

Result: OpenFPL预测精度与商业服务相当，并且在关键高回报球员预测方面具有优势。此外，该方法在短期和中长期预测上均表现出色，支持长期规划和即时决策。

Conclusion: 通过公开的高性能预测方法，OpenFPL为Fantasy Premier League社区参与者提供了公平的竞争优势，填补了当前预测领域的开放性空白。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Method: 引入xRFM算法，将特征学习的核方法与树结构结合，以适应数据的局部结构，并能够扩展到几乎无限大的训练数据。

Result: xRFM在100个回归数据集上表现最佳，在200个分类数据集中与最佳方法竞争，优于GBDT，还通过平均梯度外积提供原生的解释性。

Conclusion: xRFM算法在表格数据推断任务中表现优异，兼具高性能与解释性，为现有方法提供了有力补充。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

Result: 研究表明，集成模型能提高预测的稳定性，同时还能保持甚至提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Nested-ReFT的新框架，通过嵌套的可验证奖励强化微调，提高语言模型在复杂领域（如数学推理）中的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ReFT方法在挑战性推理领域有显著提升，但训练过程中生成推理结果的高计算成本成为瓶颈。

Method: 引入基于行为模型的“嵌套ReFT”框架，其通过动态跳层减少推理计算开销，同时结合偏差消减策略以减少偏离策略问题。

Result: Nested-ReFT在多个数学推理基准上展示了更高的计算效率（tokens/sec），并在结果保持与基线ReFT一致。

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT通过降低计算成本，同时提供理论上的无偏梯度估计，在保证性能的同时优化了微调过程。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的半监督预训练策略，通过结合生成预任务和序列增强策略，显著提升时间序列分类模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督和半监督预训练方法在选择训练任务时通常采用启发式方法，而且其转移性没有保证，因此需要一种能够提高预训练效果的方法。

Method: 引入了基于神经崩塌现象的半监督预训练策略，结合旋转等角紧框分类器及伪标签，并整合生成预任务和序列增强策略，来实现深层编码器的预训练。

Result: 该方法在三种多变量时间序列分类数据集上显著优于此前的基线方法，适用于LSTM、变换器和状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 通过将预训练目标与理论上的嵌入几何对齐，可以有效提高模型性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅具备竞争力的OOD检测性能，还提供了解和解释检测结果的能力。

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Conclusion: 针对双成分混合线性回归问题，在模型过指定的情况下，EM算法的理论收敛、统计精度均受到初始设置的影响，分析带来了对EM算法行为更深层次的理解，并可推广到噪声较高的场景。

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Result: 在深度学习问题DeepSeek-R1中，通过基准驱动的训练测试，展示了该方法如何改善决策问题的推理表现。

Conclusion: 具有影响力的基准不只是测试工具，也可作为训练课程影响AI模型的能力开发和泛化水平。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

TL;DR: 研究对比了D-Wave量子退火机和Gibbs采样在限制玻尔兹曼机（RBM）中的表现，结果显示两者各有所长，但整体改善有限，建议结合经典和量子方法改进采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨D-Wave的量子退火采样是否能提高RBM的训练质量，尤其是在利用对比散度方法进行训练时是否具备优势。

Method: 通过对比D-Wave和Gibbs采样的样本，在不同训练阶段分析样本所属局部谷的数量和局部能量极小值的特性，评估采样的质量差异。

Result: D-Wave采样增加了局部谷的数量，但与Gibbs采样的局部谷分布有所不同。在高概率状态下，两者的采样效果重合较多，但在中等概率的局部最小值上表现互补。

Conclusion: 利用D-Wave采样未显著改善RBM的性能，但在特定条件下，经典与量子方法的结合可能有助于提升性能。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者在ICU常出现AKI，严重影响预后，目前缺乏准确且易于解释的预测工具，早期干预需求迫切。

Method: 研究基于MIMIC-IV数据库，抽取肝硬化患者数据，利用LASSO特征选择和SMOTE平衡数据，训练六种算法并评估预测AKI性能。

Result: LightGBM模型表现最佳，AUROC为0.808，准确率为70.4%，负预测值为91.1%，并确立了一些关键预测因子。

Conclusion: 该模型利用常规变量可精准预测ICU中肝硬化患者的AKI风险，有助于低风险患者的管理，增加临床信任，但需进一步外部验证。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Conclusion: 证明了情境学习可以成为研究模型归纳偏差和泛化能力的重要工具，并在密码推理任务中展现了优越的表现。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对Transformer的新型后门攻击方法，利用头部剪枝和恶意注入（HPMI）技术，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击常需耗费大量资源进行重新训练或更改模型架构，因此作者希望提出一种资源高效且不侵入模型架构的方法。

Method: 设计了一种基于头部重要性剪枝和注入恶意预训练头部的技术，通过对模型最不重要的头部进行替换，不使用额外训练操作建立后门。

Result: 实验证明HPMI方法在多个数据集上可实现99.55%以上的攻击成功率，对四种高级防御机制具有较强的隐蔽性与鲁棒性，且对模型的正常准确性几乎没有影响。

Conclusion: HPMI方法突破了传统依赖重新训练的后门攻击限制，为攻击者提供了一种更隐蔽高效且适用性强的攻击手段。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Motivation: 现有的在线学习方法无法有效利用重复的位移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉单一来源组件，导致适配性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种通过离线分解和在线混合的来源组件位移适配方法，离线采用EM算法对来源组件进行分解，在线通过凸优化调整混合权重。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法在多种实际回归数据集上优于基线方法，累计测试损失降低了高达67.4%。

Conclusion: 利用方法的理论推导能充分利用位移的特性，实现了出色的适配性能。研究展现了通过分解与混合方法处理来源组件位移的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于帕金森病(PD)药物管理的预测框架，利用电子健康记录进行患者药物需求预测，提供准确的用药剂量调整建议并量化预测的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前帕金森病药物管理方法过于依赖试错，无明确的预测方法，且现有机器学习模型无法量化预测的不确定性，限制了其临床信任和实际效用。

Method: 开发了一种基于符合预测的框架，使用2011-2021年收集的631个住院记录数据，在两阶段分析中先确定需要调整药物方案的患者，然后预测所需调整的左旋多巴每日等效剂量。


Result: 该框架在预测中实现了边际覆盖，与传统方法相比缩短了预测区间长度，同时通过精确预测实现短期计划，并通过更宽范围进行长期预测。

Conclusion: 该研究为临床提供了更可靠的预测工具，通过量化预测不确定性帮助制定基于证据的用药决策，优化症状控制，提高患者生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

TL;DR: SynBrain是新提出的生成框架，用于模拟视觉语义到神经反应的转换，以具有生物学解释的方式捕捉变异性和一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有确定性方法难以同时解释生物多样性和刺激编码功能一致性的问题，迫切需要一种能够以概率方式进行视觉到神经转换的建模方法。

Method: 提出了SynBrain框架，包括两个核心部分：BrainVAE——通过概率学习建模神经表示，同时引入视觉语义约束保持功能一致性；语义到神经映射器——投射视觉语义到神经反应空间促进高保真fMRI合成工具。

Conclusion: SynBrain不仅展示了在实验中的优越性能，还体现出了跨个体和时间的生物一致性，其生成信号分布揭示了解释生物神经变异性的可解释模式，具有重要研究与实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 在医疗领域引入了一种名为FedKEI的框架，用于在任务之间进行高效知识转移，提高医疗机构之间的协作效果，并能快速适应新任务。


<details>

Motivation: 医疗领域需要在保护隐私的前提下协作，并能快速适应快速变化的环境和新任务（如新疾病）。

Method: 提出了一种名为FedKEI的联邦学习框架，通过全局聚类和双层优化机制，在跨客户和跨任务间进行知识迁移并初始化适配器，以提高新任务的学习效率。

Result: 在皮肤病、胸部X光和视网膜OCT等三种基准数据集上，实验表明FedKEI相较于最新技术可以更好地适应新疾病。

Conclusion: FedKEI框架通过知识迁移和优化算法实现了在医疗环境中更快速有效的新任务适应能力，为隐私保护和协作效率提升带来了显著优势。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CLIP-Fed的新框架，利用视觉-语言预训练模型的零样本学习能力，解决了联邦学习中存在的异构客户端数据分布和隐私问题，同时提升模型性能和防御后门攻击的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决异构客户端数据分布情况下联邦学习的后门攻击问题，克服传统防御方法在实际应用中的局限性。

Method: 通过使用视觉-语言预训练模型CLIP，结合预聚合与后聚合的防御策略，并使用多模态大语言模型和频率分析增强服务器数据集；通过全局模型与CLIP的对齐，使用原型对比损失和KL散度消除后门攻击的影响。

Result: 实验证明CLIP-Fed框架在标准数据集（如CIFAR-10及其变体）上的表现优于当前最先进的方法，平均攻击成功率减少2.03%（CIFAR-10）和1.35%（CIFAR-10-LT），而平均模型精度提高7.92%和0.48%。

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed在保持模型性能的同时，显著提高了联邦学习的后门攻击防御效果，具有较高的应用价值。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的公平聚类方法在实践中可能导致不合理的聚类结果，需要一种更注重群体福利的公平聚类模型。

Method: 通过结合距离和比例代表性定义群体效用，引入了Rawlsian目标和Utilitarian目标，并为这些目标设计了新算法和理论保证。

Result: 实验证明，提出的方法在多个真实世界数据集上明显优于现有的公平聚类基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更有效且理论有保证的福利导向公平聚类方法，为公平聚类领域提供了新的方向和工具。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 物联网医疗设备（IoMT）带来医疗变革，但易受网络攻击，提出多层次入侵检测框架应对已知与未知威胁，第一层使用元学习检测未知攻击，实验显示高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来IoMT设备应用广泛，但由于其异构性及资源受限，传统集中式IDS并不适用，且延迟与隐私问题加剧此类设备网络安全风险。

Method: 提出了一个多层次IDS框架，第一层位于近边缘，用元学习或单类分类方法粗略过滤流量攻击，后续层位于远边缘与云端，用于精细识别攻击类型和新颖性。

Result: 实验在CICIoMT2024上的结果显示，整体准确率达99.77%，F1-score为97.8%；第一层在检测未知攻击上准确度高，无需新数据集。

Conclusion: 该多层次架构在IoMT环境中表现出高效性，元学习方法在有限环境中具有良好实用性。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了eMamba，一个专为边缘设备设计的Mamba模型硬件加速框架，在保持精度的同时，显著提高了计算效率和硬件性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，基于状态空间模型（SSM）的机器学习架构在处理序列数据方面受到关注。Mamba作为一种序列到序列的SSM，虽然在计算效率上优于变压器模型，但尚无针对其优化的硬件加速框架。这促使研究者开发出能在资源受限的边缘设备上高效部署Mamba模型的硬件框架。

Method: 通过用轻量化的硬件友好替代方案取代复杂的归一化层，近似计算高开销的操作（如SiLU激活和指数运算），并进行近似感知神经架构搜索（NAS）来调整参数，开发出eMamba框架。此外，eMamba针对AMD ZCU102 FPGA和使用GlobalFoundries（GF）22nm技术的ASIC进行了量化与实现。

Result: eMamba在Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和MARS等数据集上，与最先进技术取得了相当的精度，同时使用的参数量减少了1.63-19.9倍。此外，在WikiText2数据集的大规模自然语言任务上表现良好，显示出稳定的困惑度。硬件实验表明，与基线方案相比，eMamba在延迟、吞吐量、面积、功耗和能耗等方面分别改善了4.95-5.62倍、2.22-9.95倍、4.77倍、9.84倍和48.6倍。

Conclusion: eMamba作为一个端到端硬件加速框架，为在边缘平台上高效部署Mamba模型提供了可能，显著提高了计算效率、硬件性能和能源利用率的同时，保持了与现有技术相当的精度。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估框架来验证个体倾向学习方法是否真正捕捉到标注者个体倾向并提供有意义的行为解释。

Method: 提出了一个较为系统的评估框架，并设计了两个指标：标注者一致性差异(DIC)和行为对齐解释性(BAE)，用于衡量模型对标注者个性化行为模式的捕捉和解释能力。

Result: 通过全面实验验证了提出的评估框架和指标的有效性，显示其能够较好地评估ITL方法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究填补了个体倾向学习方法评估领域的空白，有助于更全面地理解多标注者学习的动态和理解标注者行为解释性。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: XQuant提出了通过量化和缓存层输入激活来减少内存消耗，同时保持高精度，能够显著提升LLM推断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算能力的提升，内存容量和带宽的限制使得高效推断大型语言模型(LLM)变得具有挑战性，因此需要一种能够减少内存需求的新方法。

Method: 提出了XQuant方法，通过低比特量化层输入激活代替KV缓存，并在推断期间实时重新生成Keys和Values，从而减少内存使用。此外，提出了XQuant-CL，利用跨层输入相似性实现更高的压缩率。

Result: XQuant相较KV缓存直接减半内存使用，进一步结合XQuant-CL可实现高达12.5倍的内存节省，同时保证极小的准确性损失（例如，0.01 perplexity降低）。

Conclusion: XQuant利用硬件计算能力提升，解决了内存瓶颈问题，并在内存效率和模型准确性上超越了现有KV缓存量化方法。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

Method: SC2Arena：支持所有种族、低级别动作空间并优化文本观察以解决空间推理挑战；StarEvolve框架：包括层级化规划执行、迭代自我校正和高质量数据微调。引入计划-执行-验证结构和评分系统优化训练样本质量。

Result: 实验表明StarEvolve在战略规划能力上表现出色，并借助SC2Arena提供了难以通过以往基准获得的见解。

Conclusion: SC2Arena和StarEvolve可以有效推动通用代理发展，其代码、环境及算法均已公开。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)方法，通过显式模仿SAM的正则化行为实现性能改进，同时计算开销减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)对广义张量化模型的范数动态及其正则化行为的影响。

Method: 引入范数偏差的概念，通过梯度流分析推导了SAM中范数偏差的进化。基于此，提出了一种简单高效的方法DAS，通过数据自适应方式对核心范数进行缩放，以显式模仿正则化行为。

Result: 在张量补全、噪声训练、模型压缩及参数高效微调等多个任务中，DAS实现了较SAM更优或相当的性能且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: DAS方法通过数据自适应调整核心范数，简化了SAM的计算复杂性，同时在各类任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出RealAC框架，用于生成真实可行的反事实解释，支持用户定义的约束，且无需显式领域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以普遍适用且可能生成不合理的反事实解释，针对这些问题提出解决方案。

Method: 以对齐特征对的联合分布实现自动保留复杂的特征间依赖，同时允许用户“冻结”某些属性。

Result: 在三种合成数据集和两种真实数据集的评估中表现优于现有方法及基于大型语言模型的生成技术。

Conclusion: RealAC兼顾现实性与可操作性，为因果关系感知和用户中心的反事实生成提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络解释技术多为后验和全局化，不适合需要解释每个节点或局部推理的场景，尤其是在医疗领域中，这种透明性至关重要。

Method: 提出了X-Node框架，结合节点的上下文特征（如度数、中心性、聚类等），通过一个轻量级解释器模块生成解释向量，用于（1）重构节点嵌入，（2）生成自然语言解释，（3）通过'文本注入'机制指导GNN操作。

Result: 在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上的实验证明，X-Node在保持竞争分类精度的同时，能够生成忠实可靠的逐节点解释。

Conclusion: X-Node有效提升了图神经网络的可解释性，尤其适用于需要节点级别透明度的应用场景。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出一种用于联邦图学习的创新框架GraphFedMIG，利用生成式数据增强解决统计异质性和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习受统计异质性和类别不平衡问题干扰，导致模型性能下降，尤其难以识别稀少但关键的事件。

Method: 提出GraphFedMIG框架，采用分层生成对抗网络设计。每个客户端训练一个局部生成器生成高保真特征表示，客户端被分组到簇中共享一个专用判别器，并通过互信息引导机制修正生成器参数，聚焦产生少数类别的高价值特征。

Result: 在四个实际数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG性能优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效缓解了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，通过生成式增强方法改进了模型的表现。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EDAPT的框架，通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口(BCIs)的校准问题，提高解码准确性并减少部署障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BCIs中神经信号随时间漂移和用户间差异导致精度下降及校准频繁的问题，提升实际应用可行性。

Method: 提出EDAPT框架，包括基于多用户数据训练基准解码器，并在神经模式演变时通过有监督的微调持续个性化模型。同时结合无监督领域适配进一步提升效果。

Result: EDAPT在九个数据集的三种任务中均显示出优于传统静态方法的精度提升，操作效率高，可在普通硬件上在200毫秒内更新模型。

Conclusion: EDAPT实现了校准自由的BCIs，显著减少部署障碍，具有重要的实际意义。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Result: 发现推荐系统中常见实践可能引入混杂问题，从而影响系统性能，并通过仿真分析验证了这一现象。

Conclusion: 推荐系统的若干常见实践会带来混杂问题及其性能影响，文章提供了解决建议，供从业者在实际系统中参考。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package

Motivation: 受联合嵌入预测架构（JEPAs）能力的启发，作者希望开发一种比基于重建的方法更先进的模型，用于从观察数据中构建动态系统模型。

Method: 通过结合序列嵌入和神经常微分方程，并通过损失函数强制收缩嵌入和状态跃迁中的Lipschitz常数，来构建有序的潜在状态空间。

Result: 该方法成功在仅使用图像数据的情况下，为简单的摆系统生成了结构化的潜在状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 这种方法为开发通用的控制算法和估计技术开辟了新道路，具有在机器人领域的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

Motivation: 现有ReLU网络的梯度解释方法易受单个像素的影响，解释噪声高且难以理解。

Method: 设计了一个谱框架来系统性分析平滑性和忠实性，并研究了通过正则化减少高频干扰的效果。

Result: 形式化定义了"解释差距"，通过实验验证了该分析框架在不同方法和数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: 构建了一种能够平衡解释平滑性和忠实性的框架，为改进后处理解释方法提供了新的方向。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four

Motivation: 现实中的多模态应用需要处理任意模态间的理解与生成任务。然而，现有方法中结合语言模型推理能力和扩散模型生成能力的灵活性与可扩展性仍存在挑战。

Method: 提出了MAGUS框架，通过认知（Cognition）和推敲（Deliberation）两个阶段将多模态任务分解。认知阶段由多角色多模态LLM代理协作完成理解与规划；推敲阶段以“Growth-Aware Search”机制结合LLM推理和扩散模型生成。

Result: 通过多个基准测试（包括图像、视频、音频生成及跨模态指令执行），MAGUS在性能上超过强基线及当前最高水平模型，在MME基准中更优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MAGUS框架展现了其在多个多模态任务中的高效性能，证明了其模块化、可扩展以及支持多模态互通的优势。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

Method: 通过深度强化学习训练NMC的非局域转移策略，以能量变化和局部能量最小化几何作为强化学习的奖励和状态。

Result: 经过训练后的策略在硬随机4-SAT基准测试上的剩余能量、解算时间以及解多样性指标上均优于标准MCMC方法和非局域模拟退火方法。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习有效增强了NMC算法的配置空间探索能力，提升了解的质量和多样性，为解决组合优化问题提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Motivation: 当前测试时采样方法虽然能偏向生成特定目标，但难以同时从多个扩散模型生成相关样本且满足特定约束条件，无需重训的框架仍是目标。

Method: 提出PCD框架，加入耦合引导项促进模型间协作，并在每步扩散中加入投影步骤以满足硬性约束。

Result: PCD有效实现了图像对生成、对象操作、多机器人运动规划等任务，显著提升了模型协作效果并保证了约束满足，无需较高计算成本。

Conclusion: PCD为解决联合生成中的约束问题提供了一种高效的解决方案，同时不增加额外训练开销。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

Result: 在 SWE-bench Verified 和 kBench 上的实验结果显示，G-RA 方法显著提高了完成率（从 47.6% 提高到 93.8%，从 22.0% 提高到 86.0%）和修改率（从 19.6% 提高到 23.8%，从 12.0% 提高到 42.0%）。

Conclusion: G-RA 方法解决了长期 RL 任务中的奖励稀疏问题，同时避免了因奖励不一致而导致的策略退化，为平衡奖励累积提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的方法—统一学习（unified learning），通过将不同模型转化为图表示并引入一个统一的图神经网络（uGNN）优化这些模型，从而解决域分割场景中医疗成像模型的泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗成像的深度学习模型在不同域（医院、数据分布、设备等）的分布变化中表现出泛化性不足，每个医院可能需要基于其特定数据训练不同架构的深度学习模型，如何在跨数据集的情况下训练这些异构模型并提升泛化能力成为一个亟待解决的问题。

Method: 将每种模型编码为图表示，构建共享的图学习空间。通过一个统一的图神经网络（uGNN）来优化这些编码的模型，实现跨架构（MLPs, CNNs, GNNs）的参数共享和知识迁移。

Result: 在MorphoMNIST和两个MedMNIST基准测试集——PneumoniaMNIST与BreastMNIST上进行了评估，结果表明统一学习在模型被训练于独特分布数据且测试于混合分布数据的情况下，显著提高了性能，对大分布变化的未见数据表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过统一学习框架，实现对不同架构和数据分布的深度学习模型的优化与提升泛化能力，为解决医疗成像领域的域分割问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种使用生成式对抗转换器（GATs）的方法解决时间序列上采样问题，取得了比传统方法更低的误差与更高的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的上采样方法易导致信息丢失或噪声增加，而现有的生成模型和插值方法无法很好的处理上采样中的数据稀疏问题，并且通常需要高分辨率数据参与训练，这在实际场景中难以获得。

Method: 提出利用生成式对抗转换器（GATs），无需真实高分辨率数据的参与，即可实现时间序列的高效上采样。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时间序列上采样中信息丢失及稀疏数据问题，在无需高分辨率数据的情况下表现优越，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的图异常检测方法训练复杂且资源消耗大，实际对性能提升有限，因此需探索高效的方法。

Method: 提出一种名为FreeGAD的训练自由方法，利用亲和力门控残差编码器生成异常感知表示，并通过锚点节点计算异常分数。

Result: FreeGAD在多个多样化领域的基准数据集上表现出了卓越的检测性能、效率和扩展性。

Conclusion: 无需训练的FreeGAD方法提供了一种新颖、高效且可扩展的图异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Motivation: 旨在改进传统数据划分方法的不足，突出数据实例的内在质量影响，提高模型验证的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用IRT参数表征数据实例，通过IRT引导数据划分，在四个表格式数据集上验证若干ML模型的表现，并分析不同划分策略对模型偏差与方差间权衡的影响。

Result: 实验发现：IRT揭示了数据实例的内在异质性，构建了平衡分区，帮助更好地理解模型的偏差-方差权衡。同时确认高猜测参数的数据实例会显著损害模型性能，导致模型准确率降至50%以下，而其他分区则能达到70%以上。

Conclusion: IRT参数指导的数据划分比传统方法更能揭示数据特性，并能有效提升模型验证的鲁棒性及性能。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Conclusion: 新方法通过物理上的归纳偏置结合统计力学新的$\Delta\Delta E$项，改进了结合自由能变化预测，并为蛋白质工程和药物开发提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion: 通过消除捷径学习并优化模态融合，该研究有效改善了讽刺检测的准确性，对多模态情感识别任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Motivation: 现有的空间转录组聚类方法因为仅考虑单细胞或交互图的拓扑结构且对邻域信息建模不足，导致结果受数据噪声影响较大且嵌入效果较差。

Method: SPHENIC结合了拓扑不变量特征的聚类网络，并设计了空间约束与分布优化模块（SCDOM），提高相邻细胞间嵌入相似性，同时减少与非邻域细胞的相似性。

Result: 通过在14个基准空间转录组切片上的实验，SPHENIC在空间聚类任务上比最优现有方法超出3.31%-6.54%的性能。

Conclusion: SPHENIC显著改进了空间转录组数据的聚类性能，提升了低质量数据噪声下的稳定性，为细胞亚群识别提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

Motivation: 当前区域地球系统模型对高分辨率气候情景中的水文和大气过程预测能力提高，但对土地利用和土地覆盖变化的预测能力滞后。准确预测这些变化对于风险和后果评估至关重要。

Method: 将LULC预测视为条件历史和辅助数据的生成问题，使用扩散模型进行多年不可渗透区域的预测，并与假设无变化的基线模型进行比较。

Conclusion: 生成AI方法能够有效预测土地覆盖变化，未来研究可加入地球物理属性的辅助信息，并通过变量驱动模拟不同情景。

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,

MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and

### [275] [REFN: A Reinforcement-Learning-From-Network Framework against 1-day/n-day Exploitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10701)
*Tianlong Yu,Lihong Liu,Ziyi Zhou,Fudu Xing,Kailong Wang,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为REFN的框架，旨在通过训练大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成网络过滤器，以防止1天或n天漏洞的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的设备漏洞修复手段在规模、兼容性以及部署过程中存在局限，导致网络设备遭受漏洞攻击的风险增加。

Method: 引入REFN，利用强化学习（RL）而非传统的人类反馈来训练LLM生成网络过滤规则。同时，采用边界安全网关统一部署，利用在线网络流量进行验证，并通过知识提炼、上下文翻译等方式解决LLM在漏洞预防中的挑战。

Result: 在22种漏洞实验中，REFN的准确率比现有方法提升了21.1%，补丁平均应用时间缩短至3.65小时，并可扩展至1万台设备。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLM快速防止大规模漏洞利用提供了一个有效和可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU的开源电磁仿真框架，用于天线设计和优化中的机器学习应用，展示了GPU相比于传统CPU在性能上的显著提升，并验证了其仿真结果与商业软件的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电磁仿真计算复杂且耗时，在进行机器学习的训练阶段往往需要大量数据样本，因此需要一种高效生成样本的解决方案。

Method: 通过基于开源仿真软件gprMax的框架，利用GPU生成包含大量天线仿真结果的数据集，并比较了不同机器学习模型的天线参数估计性能以及开源软件与商业软件的仿真一致性。

Result: 入门级GPU的性能远超高端CPU，而高端游戏GPU在计算性能上可达高端CPU的约18倍。此外，开源软件在高分辨率下可达到与商业软件相当的仿真结果质量。

Conclusion: 基于GPU的天线仿真框架能够高效产生大量训练样本，显著提升了电磁仿真效率，同时保证精准度，为天线设计与优化的机器学习应用提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种分析型个性化联邦学习（APFL）方法，通过双流最小二乘法解决非IID数据问题，实现更优的集体泛化和个体个性化。实验表明，APFL在多个数据集上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化联邦学习方法在处理非IID数据时表现不佳，限制了集体泛化能力，影响个性化模型的训练效果。

Method: 采用一个冻结的基础模型作为特征提取器，后续通过双流分析模型达成全局泛化与局部个性化：主流用于全局泛化，细化流用于个体个性化。APFL的解析解保证了异质性不变性，即数据分布的异质性不影响个性化模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，APFL在最低1.10%-15.45%准确率优势下，优于现有的最新方法。

Conclusion: APFL通过创新的双流模型和解析解方法，克服了非IID数据的挑战，实现了更好的个性化及全局性能均衡，为PFL领域提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在强化学习中采用Pass@k作为奖励指标的效果，分析了其对探索能力的改进，以及探索与利用之间交互的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）采用Pass@1作为奖励，但存在探索与利用难以平衡的问题，可能导致策略收敛于局部最优。调整奖励指标以提升探索能力变得重要。

Method: 本文首次尝试将Pass@k作为奖励进行策略训练，分析其改进探索能力的效果，并进一步推导Pass@k的优势解析解，以高效设计奖励优势函数。

Result: 通过采用Pass@k训练策略模型，发现其显著改进了探索能力，并解析出探索与利用目标间可以互相促进。

Conclusion: 本文验证了Pass@k在RLVR中的潜力，不仅提升了探索性能，还提出了奖励优势设计的新方向，为未来研究开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Motivation: 解决变压器在大型物理系统数据集中由于注意力机制二次复杂度造成的效率瓶颈问题，同时探索使其在非顺序数据上高效工作的能力。

Method: 结合Erwin架构和原生稀疏注意力(NSA)机制，以适应非顺序数据，并实现Erwin NSA模型，在物理科学的三个数据集（宇宙学模拟、分子动力学、气压建模）上进行测试并验证。

Result: 在三个物理科学数据集上的性能与原始Erwin模型相比持平或更优，同时重现了Erwin论文中的实验结果以确认其有效性。

Conclusion: Erwin与NSA机制的结合为大规模物理系统的数据处理提供了一种高效的解决方案，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

<details>

Motivation: 由于蛋白-配体复合物数据稀缺，大多数现有模型难以学到可迁移的几何规律并容易过拟合。

Method: 利用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论，结合粗粒到精细的生成流程及物理优化调整，提升模型对绑定口袋的分子生成能力。

Result: IBEX模型显著提高了结合成功率、Vina评分、分子多样性和分子化学有效度，同时减少了外推误差。

Conclusion: IBEX在高效捕捉蛋白-配体相互作用几何规则方面表现卓越，提供了一种解决数据稀缺问题的新方法。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DECAF-GAD的新框架，着重解决图异常检测（GAD）中的公平性问题，同时提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的GAD方法尽管取得了显著进步，但在公平性方面的研究不足。现有的基于图神经网络（GNN）的GAD模型可能继承并放大训练数据中的偏见，这是一个亟待解决的问题。

Method: 作者提出了基于因果模型的DECAF-GAD框架，核心是通过引入结构因果模型（SCM）将敏感属性与学习表示分离，设计一种专门的自动编码器结构，并结合公平性指导的损失函数。

Result: 通过在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验，DECAF-GAD不仅在异常检测性能上达到了竞争水平，而且在公平性指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD框架在保证GAD性能的同时有效地实现了公平性优化，解决了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Tlhey/decaf_code.

Motivation: 解决传统RMAB算法在非平稳动态情况下表现不佳的问题，特别是在医疗和推荐系统等具体场景中。

Method: 提出一个结合滑动窗口强化学习和上置信界机制的新算法\rmab\，用于实时学习非平稳状态的转移动态及其变化。

Result: 理论上证明\rmab\算法在一类非平稳RMAB问题中达到了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾界限。

Conclusion: \rmab\为非平稳RMAB问题提供了第一个具有理论支持的框架，是该领域新的开拓性方法。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Result: 研究给出选择在线高斯过程算法的适用准则，并在理论和实际数据集上验证了降维标准的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究给出了在线高斯过程的降维建议，提供实际指南，帮助选择合适的降维标准以提高算法效率。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

Result: 首次提供了一个具有结构化视角的综述，帮助从业者和研究者更高效地应用数据最小化原则。

Conclusion: 本文为AI/ML领域建立了一个以数据最小化为中心的统一框架，有助于实际落地及其更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据归因方法计算成本高昂，使得计算能力受限的方难以验证归因结果，产生信任问题。本文旨在通过交互验证方式解决这一问题，特别应用于数据定价等重要场景。

Method: 提出一个交互式的验证协议。一方作为Prover负责计算归因，另一方作为Verifier通过少量的独立模型训练验算结果。该协议在可能近似正确（PAC）的框架下运行，确保效率、完整性及可靠性。

Result: 验证协议在保证高效性的同时，能够以1-δ概率接受接近最佳归因结果的输出，并检测Prover的恶意偏差，验证者的计算开销独立于数据集大小，仅与1/ε成比例。

Conclusion: 该方法通过交互验证的方式为数据归因引入信任机制，确保在资源受限的条件下依然能获得近乎最优的归因结果，同时具备广泛适用性。

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的AI模型在设计问题中往往缺乏实验先验知识，导致生成结果可能违反隐性约束，例如产生高概率致突变的分子。因此，研究旨在通过数据集提升设计问题的实验先验覆盖度，从而改进生成分子的安全性和有效性。

Method: 作者提出了一个基于LLM管道的数据集\ourdataset，通过从实验相关文献中提取治疗性化合物信息，并总结为自然语言描述与实体表示（如SMILES或refseq ID）对，构建了包含32.3百万对数据的资源。采用了LLM、CLIP和LLava等模型架构来联合推理文本和设计目标，支持模型训练及评估。

Result: 通过在预训练阶段引入\ourdataset创建的模型（15M参数）能够在多个治疗数据集任务中胜过更大规模的2B模型，并在平均表现上追平9B模型。此外，该数据集在GuacaMol的优化实验中展示了提高分子安全性和接近原有效果水平的能力。

Conclusion: \ourdataset实现了数据驱动的先验引入，为提升模型生成能力并确保分子设计的安全性提供了新方法，对未来药物生成具有重要推动作用。同时，数据集已公开，以促进后续研究。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.
