Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于计算机视觉的系统，通过神经网络模型实时跟踪喷雾器横杆的运动，具有超过90%的检测准确率，并为改善喷雾器设计提供数据支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业生产中由于喷雾器横杆不稳定导致的施药率误差问题。

Method: 开发基于计算机视觉的系统，其中使用YOLO V7、V8和V11神经网络模型实时跟踪横杆运动，并使用倾角传感器验证模型输出的精度。

Result: 系统能够以超过90%的准确率检测目标，距离估算与倾角传感器数据相差不超过0.026米。

Conclusion: 该系统可以量化现有喷雾器和其他喷雾器的横杆运动，为横杆设计改进和施药准确性提升提供数据支持。

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

### [2] [EBC-ZIP: Improving Blockwise Crowd Counting with Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19955)
*Yiming Ma,Victor Sanchez,Tanaya Guha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于零膨胀泊松分布（ZIP）的框架EBC-ZIP，用于密度图估计，更好地处理稀疏分布问题，实现更高的准确性，并优于当前的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群计数方法通常忽视真实密度图的极端稀疏性，导致模型性能在不同密度区域间不平衡。此外，常用的损失函数基于均方误差（MSE），假设高斯分布，与离散且非负的计数数据特征不符。

Method: 使用零膨胀泊松分布（ZIP）回归替代传统回归损失，以负对数似然为目标函数，更好地处理零稀疏分布；并融入增强块分类（EBC）的框架以提升稳定性和准确性。

Result: 在四个主流的人群计数基准测试中，EBC-ZIP一致性地超越了EBC并实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EBC-ZIP结合概率模型与增强分类框架，平衡了稀疏和密集区域的计数分布，解决了现存方法的短板并树立了新标准。

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

### [3] [ToSA: Token Merging with Spatial Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20066)
*Hsiang-Wei Huang,Wenhao Chai,Kuang-Ming Chen,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ToSA，一种结合语义和空间感知的新的token合并方法，提升了ViT的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token合并方法主要利用视觉token的特征相似性，而忽视了早期ViT中可以利用的空间信息。

Method: 引入ToSA，通过深度图像生成伪空间token，结合语义和空间信息指导ViT中的token合并。

Result: ToSA在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，同时显著减少了ViT的运行时间。

Conclusion: ToSA以效率提升为目标，通过综合语义和空间的token合并策略，加速了ViT并保留了重要场景结构。

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves
critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA
outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual
and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,
making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration. The code will be

### [4] [BrokenVideos: A Benchmark Dataset for Fine-Grained Artifact Localization in AI-Generated Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20103)
*Jiahao Lin,Weixuan Peng,Bojia Zi,Yifeng Gao,Xianbiao Qi,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究引入了BrokenVideos数据集——一个涵盖3254个经过人工校验的AI生成视频，以及像素级注释的基准数据集，用于检测和定位视频中的视觉伪影区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频中经常出现视觉伪影（如运动不一致、物理不合理轨迹、物体变形等），导致缺乏真实感与用户信任，需要一种方法来检测并精确定位这些伪影的具体位置。

Method: 提出了一个名为BrokenVideos的新基准数据集，包括3,254个AI生成视频及像素级标注。通过人工验证确保标注质量；并利用其训练和评估伪影检测模型及多模态大语言模型，验证其对定位伪影的提升效果。

Result: 利用BrokenVideos数据集进行实验验证，结果显示其显著提升了伪影区域的定位能力，并成为评测生成视频中伪影定位研究的关键基准。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos数据集填补了现有数据集在视频伪影精确定位领域的空白，为改进生成视频模型的研究提供了重要的评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

### [5] [From 2D to 3D Cognition: A Brief Survey of General World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20134)
*Ningwei Xie,Zizi Tian,Lei Yang,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Meng Guo,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究调查了从2D感知向3D认知演进的世界模型，提出一个框架以梳理该领域最新进展，同时识别关键技术驱动和挑战，并提出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于世界模型在发展人工通用智能中的关键角色，尤其是在从2D向3D空间认知转变过程中，缺乏系统分类和分析。

Method: 通过引入一个概念框架，分类研究3D世界建模，强调3D表示和世界知识的进步，并分析相关认知能力的发展及其在实际应用中的部署。

Result: 研究揭示了世界模型在3D物理场景生成、空间推理和交互中的核心能力，同时指出数据、建模和实践中的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为3D世界模型的未来发展提出了系统性的方向，提出打造更健壮且可泛化的认知模型的建议，并明确了核心领域中的潜在研究机会。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

### [6] [EAR: Erasing Concepts from Unified Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20151)
*Haipeng Fan,Shiyuan Zhang,Baohunesitu,Zihang Guo,Huaiwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于AR模型的有效概念消除方法（EAR），并通过全面的基准测试验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AR模型中既要有效删除非期望概念，又要保持整体生成质量的挑战。

Method: 引入了窗口梯度累积（WGA）方法和阈值损失屏蔽（TLM）方法以实现有效的概念删除。同时，设计了一个新的评测基准ECGVF，利用LLM和视觉分类器生成和验证测试数据。

Result: 通过在ECGVF基准测试上实验，证明EAR在概念删除效果和模型实用性保持方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: EAR是一种高效的概念消除方法，设计了严谨的评测基准并在实验中展现出强有力的性能，为AR模型的概念控制提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

### [7] [Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria for Deep Neural Network Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20152)
*Deepak Ghimire,Kilho Lee,Seong-heum Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为LAASP的高效剪枝方法，通过训练中剪枝，缩小模型规模并加速运算，同时实现性能提升和浮点操作减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经网络剪枝技术中的效率问题，适应资源受限的边缘设备部署需求。

Method: 通过一种名为LAASP的机制，在训练过程中整合剪枝与微调过程，自动选择剪枝准则，并基于样本损失指导剪枝层的决策，同时动态确定各层的最佳剪枝比例。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上测试有显著效果：CIFAR-10上ResNet56和ResNet110模型的top-1精度提升并减少52% FLOPs；ImageNet上ResNet50减少超过42% FLOPs，top-5精度仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过训练中剪枝及损失感知的自动准则选择，显著减少FLOPs且保持精度，提供高效网络压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文探讨通过示例对的方式进行图像编辑，以克服单纯依赖文本所带来的局限性，提出了无需优化的端到端方法，并证明了其在多种编辑任务中的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像编辑任务本质模糊，单靠文本难以全面表达编辑意图，因此需要探索基于图像示例对的方法。

Method: 结合预训练的文本到图像扩散模型和多模态视觉语言模型，提出无需优化的端到端图像编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种编辑类型上优于现有方法，同时提高了编辑效率（速度快4倍）。

Conclusion: 示例对驱动的端到端处理方式，有效填补了文本编辑的局限，为高效、多样化的图像编辑提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

### [9] [Seeing is Believing? Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168)
*Zhentao He,Can Zhang,Ziheng Wu,Zhenghao Chen,Yufei Zhan,Yifan Li,Zhao Zhang,Xian Wang,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一种新的基准数据集（KIE-HVQA）和基于GRPO框架的方法，用于评估和减少降级文档理解中的OCR幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理真实世界降级视觉数据时容易出现语言依赖或视觉-文本推理对齐问题，导致生成幻觉内容，因此需要应对这些不确定性挑战。

Method: 提出了KIE-HVQA数据集，包含带有真实世界降级的身份卡和发票测试样本；引入了一种基于GRPO的框架，并设计了视觉不确定性自我感知和拒绝回答机制，通过监督微调和强化学习减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，所开发的7B参数模型在KIE-HVQA上无幻觉准确率比GPT-4o提高了22%，且在标准任务中没有显著性能下降，表现出工具的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合创新数据集和框架设计，显著改善了模型在降级文档场景中识别不确定性和避免幻觉内容生成的能力，为多模态模型的未来发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

### [10] [Towards Scalable and Generalizable Earth Observation Data Mining via Foundation Model Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20174)
*Man Duc Chuc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过组合现有预训练模型来改进地球观测任务的性能，提出了特征级集成和知识蒸馏方法，结果显示这些方法能在减少资源需求的同时达到或超越大模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测数据挖掘中的大模型通常需要庞大的数据和计算资源，而通过组合已有模型可能提供一个更高效的替代方案。

Method: 评估了多个预训练模型（如Prithvi、Hiera、DOFA）的性能，并使用特征级集成和知识蒸馏等技术，在GEO-Bench基准上分析其效果。

Result: 小型预训练模型的特征级集成在多任务上达到了与更大模型相当或更高的性能，同时显著降低了训练时间与计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过集成和知识蒸馏技术，能够在保持高性能的情况下显著减小模型规模，为地球观测任务模型的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

### [11] [Progressive Alignment Degradation Learning for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20179)
*Enzhe Zhao,Zhichang Guo,Yao Li,Fanghui Song,Boying Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度学习泛色增强方法，克服了Wald协议的不足，显著提升了高分辨率多光谱图像的细节和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的泛色增强方法依赖于Wald协议创建的合成数据，但其对真实世界退化模式的描述不够准确，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 引入渐进对齐退化模块（PADM），通过两个子网络（PAlignNet和PDegradeNet）进行相互迭代学习真实退化过程，并结合高频嵌入扩散框架HFreqdiff，以及CFB和BACM模块，提升细节提取和逆过程学习的精度。

Result: 提出的方法在实验和消融研究中表现优异，显著超过了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过自适应学习退化过程与高频嵌入的创新设计，本方法有效融合高分辨率泛色与多光谱图像，极大提升了多光谱图像的空间清晰度和质量。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### [12] [UniCode$^2$: Cascaded Large-scale Codebooks for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20214)
*Yanzhe Chen,Huasong Zhong,Yan Li,Zhenheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的级联代码簿框架UniCode^2，用于实现更稳定、容量更大的视觉离散化，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代码簿方法要么语义精度较低，要么训练不稳定，需要一种能够同时扩展容量和保持稳定性的方法。

Method: 通过聚类数百万个SigLIP序列嵌入，构建一个50万个条目的代码簿，采用级联设计：一个冻结的代码簿锚定嵌入空间，一个可训练的代码簿优化任务特定的语义。

Result: 实现高质量的视觉合成，代码簿的扩展能力不会影响训练的稳定性、语义表达能力和模块化设计。

Conclusion: UniCode^2展示了在不牺牲稳定性和语义对齐的情况下扩展视觉标记空间的可行性，适用于多模态大语言模型的开发。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

### [13] [Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation for Hybrid Event-RGB Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20222)
*Pujing Yang,Guangyi Zhang,Yunlong Cai,Lei Yu,Guanding Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对事件相机和RGB相机联合传输的高效方案，利用贝叶斯建模和信息瓶颈方法解决数据传输的冗余问题，并实现实时去模糊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机与RGB相机联合使用时存在数据传输效率低下的问题，其中冗余信息是主要挑战。

Method: 通过建立联合事件和图像（E-I）传输框架，利用贝叶斯建模及信息瓶颈方法来解析共享与领域特定的信息，并根据场景动态自适应分配传输带宽。

Result: 实验结果表明，这一方案不仅在重建质量上优于传统方法，还提供了更优的实时去模糊性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一个结合事件相机与RGB相机的高效传输框架，实现了数据传输优化和去模糊效果提升。

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized
baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast,
DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of
baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment. Our

Conclusion: 研究表明，从光谱领域进行配准和融合能够有效提升HSI与MSI的综合性能，并验证了一种高效的稀疏融合模型及其收敛算法的可行性与优越性。

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型采样策略Ctrl-Z Sampling，用于解决扩散模型在条件生成中容易陷入局部最优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中表现强劲，但由于潜在空间的复杂性和次优初始化，容易产生局部视觉一致但整体不匹配的结果。

Method: 提出了一种称为Ctrl-Z Sampling的采样策略，通过奖励模型检测局部最优点，注入噪声并返回到较早的状态进行重新优化，采用动态的前后交替策略以提高生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，Ctrl-Z Sampling显著提高了生成质量，仅需增加约7.6倍的函数评估次数。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling是一种与现有扩散框架兼容的方法，可以显著提升扩散模型的对齐和视觉质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly
available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined
with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提升了诊断性能，还增强了解释性，有助于临床洞察以及生物标志物发现。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

Method: 提出基于Quickshift++、特征自相似性以及广义最大池化(GMP)的三种检测策略，并在训练阶段调整稀有脸样本比例，在评估阶段引入质量感知GMP提高鲁棒性。

Result: 验证了爆发性现象的广泛存在，通过实验发现抑制爆发性明显提升总体识别效果。

Conclusion: 爆发性现象是SFR中的关键问题，有效检测并抑制后可显著增强人脸识别性能和模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

Motivation: 历史文献因其复杂的页面组织结构，需要鲁棒且高效的版面分析方法，这是实现自动化处理的关键。

Method: 对两个基于Transformer的模型(Co-DETR, Grounding DINO)和三种YOLO变体(AABB, OBB, YOLO-World)在三个不同复杂度的数据集(e-NDP, CATMuS, HORAE)上进行性能对比。

Result: 在e-NDP数据集上，Co-DETR表现最优(mAP=0.752)，而在更复杂的CATMuS和HORAE数据集上，YOLOv11x-OBB优势显著(mAP分别为0.564和0.568)。

Conclusion: 方向边界框(OBB)对于建模历史文献的非笛卡尔结构至关重要。Transformer和CNN模型各有优势：Transformer适于结构化布局，CNN则更能应对视觉多样性和复杂性。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习框架不仅实现了高效鲁棒的零水印处理，还能在多种失真环境中展现卓越性能，证明了其实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于激光雷达的方法尽管精确，但成本高昂，而现有RGB影像深度学习方法在提取冠层高度方面精确度不足，亟需开发经济高效的替代方案以支持CCER计划中的碳固存监测。

Method: 开发了一种新型模型，基于大规模视觉基础模型（LVFM），结合特征提取模块、自监督特征增强模块和高度估计器，通过1米分辨率的Google Earth影像生成高分辨率冠层高度图。

Result: 模型在北京市房山区进行测试，相较传统CNN方法表现更优，绝对误差（MAE）为0.09米，均方根误差（RMSE）为0.24米，相关系数达0.78。生成的冠层高度图可实现个体树木检测成功率超90%，并精确估算地上生物量，能够有效追踪植被生长。

Conclusion: 该方法为种植园及自然森林的碳固存监测提供了一种高效、可扩展的工具，表现出良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

Conclusion: HiWave无需重新训练和模型修改，在超高分辨率图像合成中取得了显著的效果，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用于自动识别岩石螺栓的方法缺乏鲁棒性，并且手动测量过程在地下矿中受限于低光环境和耗时因素，需求一个高效自动的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一种两阶段深度学习架构DeepBolt，专门为解决严重类别不平衡问题而设计，用于在复杂的3D点云中自动高效地识别岩石螺栓。

Conclusion: DeepBolt的实验结果表明，该方法在复杂的地下环境中具有卓越的鲁棒性和有效性，优于当前的岩石螺栓识别技术。

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point
clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.
Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,
achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,
demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground
environments.

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

Method: 提出PLADA框架，由"块效应擦除"模块（B2E）与"开放数据聚合"模块（ODA）组成，通过双阶段注意机制处理压缩效应，并混合使用配对和非配对数据以提高检测能力。

Conclusion: 文章突出了"块效应"在深度伪造检测中的重要性，并为开放世界场景提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Motivation: 单帧检测方法忽略了视频中的时序信息，而现有的视频目标检测方法则复杂度过高，难以应用于实际场景。

Method: 结合YOLO检测器，使用多帧叠加输入但仅监督目标帧输出，最大限度地利用时序信息同时保持实时性和模型的简单性。

Result: 实验表明新方法在MOT20Det和BOAT360数据集上显著提高了检测的鲁棒性，尤其是在轻量级模型上的表现更为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缩小了轻量级和重型检测网络的性能差距，提出的数据集为未来的多帧视频检测研究提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 对抗性掩码图像建模提升了半监督学习中Transformer的性能，为医学图像分割任务带来了显著的改进，为相关领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of

these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across

Motivation: 现有方法在对长时间的视频提案进行描述时，未能充分捕捉事件场景的动态变化，因此无法有效处理场景与物体变化较大的提案。

Method: 提出GPaS框架，分为“划分”和“摘要”两个阶段：首先将事件提案分割为短视频片段进行精细描述，然后将这些描述汇总成一句话；核心在于使用GCN和LSTM组合的结构处理语义词节点间的交互关系。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook II数据集上，与最先进方法相比，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过分段处理和语义交互，提升了长时间视频提案的描述质量，对密集视频描述提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Conclusion: 深度学习方法不仅提升了全方向成像距离估计的准确性和鲁棒性，还适合低成本的机器人、自动导航及监控应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic
perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

Result: 实验表明WonderFree模型显著提升了不同视角的渲染质量和全局一致性，用户偏好测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WonderFree实现了更高质量的3D探索体验，将推动3D生成领域更进一步，代码数据将公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一视觉特征捕捉预定义伪造痕迹，无法在多样化的遥感数据中有效泛化。

Method: 采用空间域和频率域特征提取器，并通过特征映射和融合模块（如CBAM注意力机制）处理多域特征，从而提高伪造检测效果。

Result: 在三个数据集上，SFNet的准确率相比现有方法提升4%-15.18%，表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SFNet在检测遥感影像伪造方面优于现有技术，兼具创新性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: VIPScene通过视频生成模型的3D物理世界常识，实现高逼真度和结构一致的场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻传统3D场景合成对专家知识和人工的依赖，为建筑设计、机器人模拟、虚拟现实及游戏等领域带来便利。

Method: 提出VIPScene框架，使用视频生成、3D重建以及开放词汇感知模型进行语义和几何分析，并引入FPVScore进行评估。

Result: VIPScene显著优于现有方法，在多种场景中表现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: VIPScene通过创新性的多模型整合，实现了灵活、高质量的3D场景合成，其代码计划公开。

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant
manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as
architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

Method: 采用开放词汇的分割技术提取物体轮廓，使用视觉语言模型对其进行语义解释，然后利用文本到图像扩散模型生成符合输入形状的动物图像，最后将其融入原始场景中以生成视觉连贯且空间一致的作品。

Result: 在多样的真实世界输入上评估了Shape2Animal，验证了其鲁棒性和创意潜能。

Conclusion: Shape2Animal可以为视觉故事讲述、教育内容、数字艺术和互动媒体设计提供新的可能性。

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous
stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces
Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting
natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible
animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary
segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive
media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

Conclusion: 研究表明，设计针对特定环境和条件的图像训练与相机位姿优化策略，可以有效提升3D重建精度，为空间态势感知提供支持。

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

TL;DR: 本论文提出MMSearch-R1，一种强化学习框架，用于实现大规模多模态模型(LMMs)在真实互联网环境中的按需多回合搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RAG和搜索代理因其流水线刚性，通常效率低下或者搜索行为过度，为解决这一问题，该研究旨在开发一种能动态处理跨模态知识需求的高效搜索框架。

Method: 论文提出了MMSearch-R1框架，通过强化学习训练模型适时调用文本和图像搜索工具；此外，作者构建了综合多样数据集，包括需要搜索和不需要搜索的样本，用于塑造模型的高效搜索行为。

Result: 在知识密集型和信息搜索型VQA任务上，MMSearch-R1不仅优于同尺寸的RAG基线模型，还匹敌更大尺寸RAG模型，同时减少了超过30%的搜索调用。

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1不仅提高了多模态搜索的效率与效果，还为后续研究提供了可操作性见解。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

TL;DR: 本文提出IPFormer，用于基于相机的3D全景场景补全，通过上下文自适应实例提议方法，提升场景理解性能并大幅减少运行成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前场景补全研究主要集中在LiDAR数据上，相机图像的应用较少，同时基于Transformer的固定查询方法在测试时无法动态适配场景。

Method: 提出IPFormer方法，首次利用上下文自适应实例提议，在训练和测试阶段依赖图像上下文生成与优化查询，推理语义实例-体素关系。

Result: 实验显示，IPFormer在全景指标PQ$^\dagger$和PQ-All上超越现有技术，且运行时间减少14倍以上。动态推导实例提议提升PQ-All 3.62%，显著改善事物指标18.65%。

Conclusion: IPFormer通过引入上下文自适应实例提议，为基于视觉的3D全景场景补全领域带来了创新性的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

*Deepon Halder,Thanmay Jayakumar,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CycleDistill方法，通过利用大语言模型（LLMs）和少量示例翻译，实现无需平行语料的高质量机器翻译，特别适用于低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言中平行语料匮乏，导致现有的大语言模型和专用机器翻译系统难以提供高质量翻译。

Method: CycleDistill方法通过迭代生成合成平行语料，并借助极少量的少示例翻译对模型进行微调，无需大量平行语料支持。

Result: 实验表明，在印度三种语言的翻译任务中，仅使用单语语料，CycleDistill方法显著优于基线模型，提升约20-30 chrF分。

Conclusion: CycleDistill方法证明了无需大量平行语料的情况下，也能实现低资源语言的高质量机器翻译，展示了其在相关领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中的表现不佳，主要因为它们难以有效利用结构化的上下文和多跳信息，而现有的RAG方法对于捕捉知识图谱中节点之间的关系结构也表现有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为Inference-Scaled GraphRAG的推理框架，该框架通过对推论阶段的计算进行扩展，包括序列扩展（深层链式思维图遍历）和并行扩展（样本轨迹的多数投票）。两种扩展通过交替进行的推理-执行循环相结合。

Result: 在GRBench基准上进行的实验表明，该方法显著提升了多跳问答任务的表现，相较传统GraphRAG和现有图遍历方法效果更佳。

Conclusion: 推理阶段的计算扩展是一种实际且与模型架构无关的解决方案，能够提升大语言模型在处理结构化知识推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

Motivation: 解决基于REST API的代理无法应对真实世界非结构化API文档的问题。

Method: 通过一个可扩展的流水线，从API文档生成可执行Python工具，并采用代码代理迭代优化。

Result: 对真实世界、WebArena和科研API进行验证，达成了55%性能提升和90%成本降低。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档生成工具代理提供了一种可扩展的通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

Conclusion: STReason有助于减少专家工作负担，拓展了时空任务实际应用场景，显示了开发更强大且可扩展的时空推理系统的潜力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement

TL;DR: 通过三阶段大语言模型（LLM）框架，提高了辐射学报告校对的正预测值（PPV），并降低了运营成本，同时保持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单次的大语言模型框架在处理辐射学报告校对时，由于错误发生率较低，导致正预测值（PPV）局限，研究希望通过改进的LLM框架解决这一问题并降低运营成本。

Method: 研究采用MIMIC-III数据库的1000份辐射学报告，验证数据集包括CheXpert和Open-i。测试了三种LLM框架：（1）单次提示框架；（2）提取器+检测框架；（3）提取器、检测器和假阳性验证器框架。通过PPV和绝对真阳性率（aTPR）评估精度以及通过推断费用和人工审核支出评估效率，并结合统计学方法进行分析。

Result: 在三个框架中，框架3显著提高了PPV至0.159（相较于框架1和2显著改善），并将运营成本降低至每1000份报告5.58美元，与框架1和2相比分别减少42.6%和18.5%，同时aTPR保持稳定。人类审核报告数量从192减少至88，并通过外部验证数据集进一步证明框架3的优势。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架显著提高辐射学报告校对的PPV，降低运营成本，同时保持检测性能，是一种有效的人工智能辅助报告质量保证策略。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了利用自动评分技术的一个创新方法，以提高基于项目反应理论（IRT）的能力评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前评估高阶能力（如表达技巧和逻辑思维）的需求日益增加，而构 constructed-response 测试需要大量人工评分，成本高昂。

Method: 利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数，并结合IRT实现能力的准确评估。

Result: 提出的方法在能力评估中展现了较高的准确性，同时显著减少了人工评分工作量。

Conclusion: 通过新方法可以优化高阶能力的测评流程，减少人工操作并提高效率。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [58] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CCRS，一个基于LLM的高效评估框架，用于评价RAG系统的输出质量，尤其在生物医药领域的BioASQ数据集中展示了其性能优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法不足以全面分析RAG系统的多方面质量需求，且复杂的多阶段评估框架效率低下。需要一种高效全面的评估方法。

Method: 引入CCRS框架，该框架使用一个预训练的大型语言模型作为零样本端到端的评估工具，提供五个指标：情境连贯性(CC)、问题相关性(QR)、信息密度(ID)、答案正确性(AC)以及信息回忆(IR)。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上评估了六种RAG系统配置，证明了CCRS能够有效区分系统性能，例如Mistral-7B在评分上优于Llama变体。同时，CCRS与RAGChecker相较，在评估效果接近或优于的同时，显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供了一个实用、全面、低成本的评估框架，有助于推动RAG系统的不断改进。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出AALC，一种在强化学习中集成的轻量级、注重准确性的长度奖励方法，以在训练中动态平衡正确性和简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模推理模型尽管具备强大的推理能力，但生成冗长的推理链条会带来高延迟和高成本，却未必显著提高准确性，因此需要一种方法在保持准确性的同时减少冗余推理。

Method: 研究提出AALC，它将验证准确性纳入奖励机制中，并通过平滑、动态调度的长度惩罚在目标性能达到之前延迟施加长度惩罚，从而动态平衡正确性和推理长度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持或提高原始准确性的同时，减少了超过50%的响应长度。此外，分析发现，AALC有助于削减冗余推理模式，并优化输出结构。

Conclusion: AALC不仅提高了推理效率，同时也可能减少模型输出的可解释性。这表明基于奖励的方法具有引导大规模推理模型实现更高效、可泛化推理路径的潜力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出SEED方法，通过融合结构编码器和语言模型，解决多元时间序列预测中结构依赖建模与语义推理适应之间的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多元时间序列预测中需要同时捕捉变量间的结构依赖和任务间的泛化能力，但现有方法在支持语义级推理和任务适应方面存在不足。

Method: 提出一个名为SEED的分步解码框架：包括一个用于提取数据块的编解码器、一个对齐数据块与语言模型嵌入的投影模块、用于语义重编程的机制以及用于预测的冻结型语言模型。

Result: 实验证明，SEED方法在多个数据集上相较于现有基线方法有一致的性能提升，并有效弥合结构建模和语义推理的差距。

Conclusion: SEED框架通过模块化设计，将数值模式与语义推理高效对齐，为多元时间序列预测任务提供了统一且可迁移的方法。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了COIN框架，通过统计有效的方式实现不确定性量化，并在用户定义的错误发现率（FDR）约束下，筛选出单一答案以提高实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在基础模型中的不确定性量化方法多缺乏对选择性预测关键指标（如FDR）的正式保证。而现有方法构建的预测集常包含不准确的候选项，影响其实用效果。

Method: 提出COIN框架，通过在校准集合上估计经验错误率并应用Clopper-Pearson等置信区间方法，建立真实错误率（FDR）的高概率上界，从而选择最大的不确定性阈值以保证测试数据的FDR控制。

Result: COIN展现了在风险控制方面的鲁棒性、较高的保留正确答案能力，以及在校准数据有限时的预测效率。此外，替代的上界构建方法和不确定性量化策略进一步提升了其性能。

Conclusion: COIN框架不仅在控制用户定义FDR方面表现出色，还展现了高度可扩展性和适应性，适合多种应用场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

Motivation: 为解决复杂任务（如对话情感识别）中语言模型表现提升的挑战，通过检索高质量情境学习样本来提升模型性能。

Method: 引入随机和增强样本检索策略，分析对话情境对情感识别准确性的影响，并在IEMOCAP、MELD和EmoryNLP三大数据集上进行实验测试。

Result: 实验表明，与其他技术相比，增强样本检索在所有数据集上都具有更好的表现，显示出检索目标一致且通过改写强化样本的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过高质量样本增强和目标一致性，能够显著提高大语言模型在对话情感识别中的性能，并验证了增强样本检索的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

TL;DR: 本文通过内在评估和外在评估方法比较捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语义属性检测与下游任务之间的关系，以及开发更具实际操作性的语义嵌入模型。

Method: 在内在评估中，使用Costra数据集及语义文本相似性基准评估语义捕捉能力；在外在评估中，利用COMET-based指标微调嵌入模型并评估译文质量。

Result: 发现内在语义相似性测试表现优秀的模型在翻译评估任务中表现不一致；而具有过平滑嵌入空间的模型经过微调后表现出色。

Conclusion: 语义属性检测工具和实际任务之间的关系复杂，需进一步研究操作性语义嵌入及任务特定数据集（如翻译评估）。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的多视角方法，使用软标签处理 NLP 中的主观性任务，从而更好地捕捉标注者之间的分歧，同时提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前传统的方法通过聚合标注者的观点来确定单一的真相标签，这忽视了个体间的分歧，尤其是在主观性任务中，这可能导致少数视角的缺失。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于软标签的多视角方法，用以捕捉不同标注者的分歧，并基于主观性文本分类任务（仇恨言论、讽刺、侮辱性语言与立场检测）进行了分析和测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，多视角方法不仅更好地拟合了真实的人类标签分布（通过Jensen-Shannon Divergence度量），还能在分类性能（F1分数）上优于传统方法，但在讽刺与立场检测任务中的置信度较低。

Conclusion: 新方法有效捕捉了被忽视的主观视角分歧，以生成更包容的模型。但在主观性较强的任务中还需进一步优化确保更高的模型置信度。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理和自动决策方面取得了进展，但是在逻辑推理和系统性规划等复杂任务中仍有困难。本研究旨在解决LLMs依赖隐式统计关系的局限性，引入显式结构化知识表征增强其能力。

Method: 将非结构化数据转换为带有推理步骤的结构化格式，并通过监督微调(SFT)训练 LLMs。同时，采用组相对策略优化（GRPO），利用创新算法如最大流量（MAX-Flow）和最长公共子序列（LCS）提升推理效果并降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验验证了通过在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上应用显式结构化推理，提供了简洁的推理路径、强健的多场景表现以及与优化技术的兼容性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，整合显式结构化推理能有效提高LLMs在复杂推理任务中的表现，为LLMs的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于块的多自监督学习(SSL)融合方法，用于非母语者的语音流利度自动评估，并在两项基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估非母语者语音的流利度具有挑战性，尤其是在捕捉其语音节奏、停顿和不流利现象方面。

Method: 通过使用Silero-VAD将语音分割为呼吸组块，结合自监督学习(SSL)模型(Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM)和具有CNN-BiLSTM结构的层次框架，融合声学和语言特征，同时加入块级流利度标记以增强模型表现。

Result: 在Speechocean762数据集上相比单模型提升F1分数2.8点、Pearson相关系数6.2点；在Avalinguo数据集上F1分数提升4.2点、Pearson相关系数提升4.0点，优于基于Pyannote.audio的分割方法。

Conclusion: 基于块的多自监督学习融合方法在流利度评估中具有鲁棒性，但需要进一步研究其对具有不规则韵律的方言的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

TL;DR: 该论文结合了大语言模型和主题模型，提出了一种方法来动态检测叙事随时间的变化，特别聚焦在通过自动化手段区分内容变化和叙事变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着媒体叙事快速发展，研究叙事如何随时间变化变得重要。然而，使用大语言模型分析整个语料库成本较高，该论文旨在设计一种高效的动态叙事建模方法。

Method: 作者结合了大语言模型的语言理解能力和主题模型的规模效能，通过叙事政策框架对叙事变化进行建模，并应用主题模型和变化点检测技术筛选出具有代表性变化的文档后，再利用大语言模型自动解释这些变化。

Result: 实验在2009年至2023年的《华尔街日报》文章语料库上进行，发现大语言模型在提取特定时间点的叙事变化方面表现良好，但在区分内容变化与叙事变化时效果较差。

Conclusion: 提出的模型在动态捕捉叙事变化方面表现有效，但在某些细节任务上仍需改进。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本因隐私受限而难以获取，该研究旨在提供一种公开、规模化的替代数据源，从而支持生物医学和临床NLP的研究与应用。

Method: 首先，通过大型语言模型对PubMed文章段落进行初始注释，包括类型、领域和教育质量评分；接着，使用这些注释微调小型语言模型，将标签扩展到整个PMC-OA语料库，并通过筛选和调整生成高质量数据子集。

Result: 生成了大规模的高质量临床案例段落数据集，并通过一系列持续预训练实验表明，临床上采样和教育质量筛选可分别提升不同任务约1%-5%的性能，同时缩短了训练时间。

Conclusion: 借助Biomed-Enriched数据集，生物医学预训练策略在效率与效果上均得到提升，为领域研究提供了重要资源，有望促进相关NLP任务的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster

user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation
in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive

personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀有疾病诊断由于临床异质性、低患病率及医生对稀有病了解有限，面临重大挑战。

Method: DeepRare采用模块化架构，结合长期记忆模块、领域分析工具及最新医学知识库，进行复杂诊断推理并生成透明的诊断过程。

Result: DeepRare在多项评估中表现出色，针对2,919种疾病诊断达到100%准确率。此外，在多种评价指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepRare通过大幅提高稀有疾病的诊断准确性和推理透明度，为临床医生提供了强有力的诊断支持工具。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

TL;DR: 研究展示了当前的大型语言模型在安全性上存在严重问题，并提出了一个名为CoDoT的策略用于评估和揭示这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型广泛应用于安全关键场景，确保它们符合人类价值和偏好变得极为重要，但研究发现当前模型在安全性上严重不足。

Method: 提出一种名为Code of Thought (CoDoT)的策略，将自然语言输入转换为代表相同意图的简单代码以评估模型的安全性表现。

Result: 实验表明，使用CoDoT，GPT-4 Turbo的毒性增加了16.5倍，DeepSeek R1的失败率达100%，平均来看七个主流模型的毒性增加了300%。递归应用CoDoT甚至可使毒性翻倍。

Conclusion: CoDoT策略证明了目前LLMs在安全性上的缺陷，这凸显出从基础原则上评估和改进LLMs安全性的重要性，以确保安全性与能力同步发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究会话中讲话时间如何分配，以及如何通过定量分析提高沟通体验。

Method: 引入计算框架以量化讲话时间的分配和动态，并基于多个因素分类谈话共享动态类型。

Result: 通过分析大量陌生人视频聊天数据，证实较平衡的会话更受欢迎，并发现即便总平衡相同，不同共享动态类型对体验的影响不同。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可以提升沟通平台设计，可以应用于人类与AI或人际间的沟通平台。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过结合和合并经过微调模型变体中不同层的策略来压缩大型语言模型，实现约25%的参数减少，同时保留约97.3%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型性能优异，但模型规模庞大带来了部署和推理的挑战。因此需要寻求有效的模型压缩方法，以降低计算成本。

Method: 将层删除、层选择以及层合并结合，采用零阶优化方法，在候选模型中搜索最佳组合。

Result: 在Llama2-13B模型上，通过删除约25%的参数，压缩后的模型仍然保留了97.3%的原始性能，比现有方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高效的模型压缩，为大型语言模型的部署和推理提供了一种有竞争力的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ReCode 通过强化学习和改进的字符串相似性评价指标，提升了LLM在动态API场景下的代码生成能力，适用于多种模型和算法，代码已开放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM难以适应外部库API的频繁更新，导致代码生成可靠性不足，尤其是在动态环境中。

Method: 提出了ReCode框架，通过构建包含约2000条数据的训练集，并采用改进的字符串相似性度量作为强化学习奖励，帮助LLM实现基于更新信息的版本迁移训练。

Result: ReCode显著提升了LLM在动态API场景下的代码生成效果，尤其在未见场景任务CodeUpdateArena上表现优异，同时对LLM的通用代码生成能力影响较小。

Conclusion: ReCode在多种LLM和强化学习算法上的表现优异，比如Qwen2.5-Coder-7B模型在部分任务上超越了更大参数量的模型，展现了其在动态代码生成领域的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索基础语言模型在强化学习中的适用性，尤其是中期训练对后续RL表现的影响。

Method: 分析了不同的语料（如数学语料和问答数据）对模型训练的影响，提出了“两阶段中期训练策略”：模型先以恒定学习率在200B标记上训练，然后用学习率衰减在包含长链式推理的20B标记上训练。

Result: 提出的训练策略带来了与更适应RL的模型（如Qwen）相当的性能，推出的OctoThinker模型表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了中期训练策略在提升基础模型RL性能中的重要性，并为未来RL友好的模型训练策略提供了指引。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Conclusion: 多语言和任务相关的推理计算策略对提升语言模型在弱势语言上的表现至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

Motivation: 当前的大规模语言模型代理在任务完成中展现了卓越能力，但在高风险领域可能引发严重的伦理和安全问题，如造成物理伤害或经济损失。需要一种有效的方法来引导代理的伦理行为。

Method: 将代理行为调整框架为模型编辑任务，提出“行为编辑”技术，设计BehaviorBench测试基准以支持不同情境下的行为评估与修改。

Result: 通过表现和实验验证，行为编辑能够动态调整代理的目标行为，不仅可实现情境特定的小幅度调整，还能大范围调整代理的全球道德对齐。

Conclusion: 行为编辑提供了一种新范式来引导代理行为，说明这一技术的潜力和潜在风险，有助于探索LLM代理在伦理行为调整上的可能性。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Method: 研究了扩散大语言模型的解码行为，提出一种新颖的采样方法（coupled-GRPO），用于优化DiffuCoder的强化学习训练机制，从而增强模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiffuCoder在代码生成基准测试中性能提升了4.4%，并且减少了对传统AR解码因果性的依赖。

Conclusion: 此研究为扩散大语言模型的生成机制提供了深入见解，并提出了一种有效的、基于扩散模型的强化学习训练框架。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

Motivation: 提升语言模型在需要紧密结合推理和检索任务中的性能，例如多跳问答。

Method: 设计分三阶段的Memento策略：将复杂问题分解为小步骤；用语言模型动态构建事实数据库；结合事实解决问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著提升了现有方法性能，包括在9步PhantomWiki基准上将CoT性能翻倍，以及在2WikiMultiHopQA中提升了20+ F1百分点。

Conclusion: Memento策略能够有效提升多跳问答任务的性能，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨在大语言模型（LLMs）中如何表现出人类决策过程中关于价值权衡（如表达真相与维持信任等）的多面性，利用认知科学中关于礼貌语的认知模型进行解析，评估模型在人类式价值权衡中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在捕捉类似人类复杂价值权衡的能力上存在局限，因此需要一种工具来评估模型如何在语言生成中平衡信息和社交效用的动态与权重。

Method: 本文运用认知科学中的礼貌语言认知模型，分两种模型场景系统化评估LLMs：前沿黑盒模型的推理努力程度和开源模型在强化学习后的训练动态。

Result: 结果显示在推理模型中比起社交效用更倾向于信息效用，且开源模型在数学推理上更优。此外，在训练动态中基模型和预训练数据对效用值的影响比反馈数据集或对齐方法更为显著。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够敏感捕捉快速发展的LLM领域的多样性，帮助形成关于高级行为的假设，为改进推理模型的训练机制以及更好地控制训练中价值间的权衡提供科学依据。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and
feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas to assist in
discovering the overall proof strategy. It achieves an 86.1% success rate on
the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using
small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous
approaches. We also present case studies illustrating how these generated
lemmas contribute to solving challenging problems.

*Deng Pan,Keerthiram Murugesan,Nuno Moniz,Nitesh Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的框架，将上下文归因问题形式化为组合多臂赌博（CMAB）问题，显著提高了生成问答系统的可解释性和查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了构建可解释且可信的生成性问答系统，了解模型生成答案时哪些上下文部分起到关键作用是至关重要的。

Method: 将上下文片段视为一个臂，利用组合Thompson采样算法（CTS）在有限的查询预算下高效地探索上下文子集，定义基于归一化词元概率的奖励函数进行上下文归因。

Result: 与传统的基于扰动的归因方法（如SHAP）相比，该方法在大幅减少模型查询次数的情况下，仍然可以实现高质量的归因效果。

Conclusion: 新方法在保证归因精度的同时，提高了查询效率，对多种数据集和大语言模型均表现良好。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
potential in code generation, yet their effectiveness in quantum computing
remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum
code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack).

Method: 开发并测试了一种监测能耗和CO2排放的RAG框架，评估其在多个开源大语言模型（LLMs）基础上的表现，并与商用模型比较。

Result: RAG模型在准确性和能耗表现上优于商用模型，其中基于llama3.1:8B的RAG模型在准确性和环境影响方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，本地化LLMs可用于开发环保且准确性高的RAG模型，推动可持续AI发展以符合联合国可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

TL;DR: 探讨了分配不同人物角色的LLMs是否会展示类似于人类的动机性推理及其对结果判断的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探讨大语言模型是否会因分配身份角色而表现出类似人类的动机性推理行为，并评估其是否加剧了与身份一致的推理倾向。

Method: 分配8种人物角色给8个大语言模型，并测试其在两个推理任务（虚假信息标题真伪判别和科学性数据评估）中的表现。

Result: 具有分配身份角色的LLMs在真伪判断能力上下降了最多9%；政治性人物角色在与自身身份一致时，对枪支管控的科学证据评估正确率高出90%。传统的去偏方法基本无效。

Conclusion: 身份分配会导致LLMs表现出人类类似的动机性推理模式，这种现象难以通过常规去偏方法缓解，可能加剧身份一致性的偏见推理问题。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要聚焦于诊断推荐，忽略了EHR的重要性，限制了其临床应用。

Method: 提出DiaLLM，通过设计临床测试参考策略（CTR）和强化学习框架来整合EHR中的异质数据，并引入拒绝采样策略和特定奖励机制，提高诊断准确性和效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiaLLM在临床测试推荐和诊断预测方面优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR数据和优化模型结构，提升了与实际医疗实践的契合度，推动了医疗大模型的临床应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: AI驱动的工具有助于减少科研重复性验证的负担，提升科学交流的透明性和可信性；模块化架构还可扩展至解决更多开放科学相关目标。

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,
accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be
independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces
OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

Result: 共发现1,162种新模型设计，其中1,062种完成预训练验证，最佳设计在9个基准测试中6个超越了现有架构。此外，遗传编程比传统方法设计效率提升了约86%。

Conclusion: Genesys系统证明了通过多智能体LLM模拟研究过程的有效性，该框架可用来实现语言模型设计的自动化与优化，且优于多种现有模型。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为企业定制模型评估提供了蓝图，揭示了当前企业部署LLM时的关键性能瓶颈，并为其优化提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting
productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific
task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy
to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address
challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline
combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented
generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six
leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary
models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to
overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and
offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides
enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: 通过开放源码和资源，Mobile-R1为移动智能体研究提供了新工具，并推动了多轮强化学习在该领域的应用与发展。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

Motivation: 现有LLM方法在特征生成中过于简单或重复，缺乏结构性推理指导。本研究旨在改善这种不足，提升生成特征的质量和多样性。

Method: 在REFeat中，通过多种推理方式指导LLM进行特征生成，从而避开单一转化产生的偏差，为表格数据建立更丰富的特征。

Result: 在对59个基准数据集的实验中，REFeat平均上实现了更高的预测准确性，并生成了更为多样和有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 通过结合丰富的推理框架和自适应策略选择，REFeat展示了LLM作为表格数据特征生成工具的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

Motivation: 随着电动车(EV)的普及，对如何将其高效整合到现代服务系统中的需求与日俱增。特别是，V2G技术的进步为电动车在支持电网的同时创造收入提出了新的挑战和机遇。

Method: 作者提出了电动车路径选择问题与车网互动技术(EVOP-V2G)，并将其建模为混合整数规划(MIP)问题，开发了两种高效的元启发式算法：一个基于进化算法(EA)，另一个基于大邻域搜索(LNS)的算法。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种智能且盈利的电动车移动性系统路径，结合V2G技术，不仅优化了司机利益，还增强了对电网的支持。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

Conclusion: GymPN 软件库为业务流程中的复杂决策提供了高效建模与学习支持，在实际场景中表现出了优越的效果。

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model

However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the

probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于如何在机器中设计和构建“感知能力”的定义，并讨论了具体功能和计算层面上的细节，以及可能的实现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 界定机器感知能力的含义，明确其在AI中的作用，为避免或及时识别功能性有感知力的人工代理创建提供依据。

Method: 提出了一种结合持久性和质感属性的感知定义，并从功能和计算的角度提出实现建议。

Result: 提供了在当前技术条件下实现功能型感知概念的框架，并强调了监测是否无意中创建感知代理的重要性。

Conclusion: 机器感知能力的构建需要满足具体功能和主观感知属性的结合，为理解和合理设计AI的感知提供了新视角。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

*Wenbin Gan,Minh-Son Dao,Koji Zettsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于案例推理的大型语言模型框架（CBR-LLM），用于在复杂高风险场景中进行规避操作决策，并验证了其在多个模型上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱动安全关键场景要求快速且符合情境的决策，传统的大型语言模型应用于自动驾驶存在适应性和知识不足问题。

Method: 通过将行车视频输入的语义场景理解与相关案例检索相结合，使得大型语言模型能够生成情境敏感且符合人类决策的规避操作建议。

Result: 所提框架提高了决策准确性、解释质量，与专家行为更一致，并在多种风险场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CBR-LLM展现了强大的适应性和鲁棒性，可作为智能驾驶系统中可靠的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great
promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate
in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader

by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live
evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with

Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at
exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.
CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2%
human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions. Our code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Decrypto的游戏化基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的多智能体推理能力和心理理论（ToM）能力，克服了现有基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs具备越来越多的代理能力，其需要在复杂的多智能体场景中与人类用户和其他代理互动，对心理理论（ToM）的能力需求日益增强，然而现有评估方法存在多种缺陷。

Method: 通过借鉴认知科学、计算推理学和多智能体强化学习，设计了一个名为Decrypto的交互式、多维度的游戏基准，来测试多智能体推理和ToM能力，并通过验证实验支持基准设计的有效性。

Result: 前沿LLMs在Decrypto中表现落后于人类和简单的词嵌入基线。在复现经典认知科学实验的过程中，发现最新的推理模型在关键ToM能力上表现显著落后于过往模型。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了现有推理和心理理论评估的关键空白，为改进人工代理能力铺平了道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

Motivation: ML领域快速进步，但同行评审的局限性导致错误或误导性的研究被接受，缺乏系统纠正错误的机制。

Method: 建议在ML会议中设立“反驳与批评”轨道（R & C Track），提供一个高调、可靠的平台以支持批判性研究。

Result: 提出了R & C轨道的设计、审查原则及潜在的实施挑战，并举例展示其应用。

Conclusion: ML需要官方机制来支持研究过程的自我纠正，R & C轨道是一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

Motivation: 多目标优化在机器学习、运筹学、工程中广泛应用，但其算法设计仍处于起步阶段，现有方法的收敛速度和样本复杂性表现不理想。

Method: 提出STIMULUS算法，通过递归框架改进随机梯度估计的更新效率；引入STIMULUS-M加入动量以加速收敛；此外，通过自适应批次机制提升了算法的兼容性（STIMULUS+ / STIMULUS-M+）。

Conclusion: STIMULUS及其拓展版本不仅提升了收敛性能，还降低了样本复杂性，在MOO问题上展现出强大优势。

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和控制论状态空间方程的FlightKooba框架，显著减少Koopman算子的计算复杂度，并提高模型可解释性、减少模型参数和训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Koopman理论的飞行轨迹预测模型效能较低，可解释性和计算成本是瓶颈。

Method: 提出FlightKooba框架，通过HIPPO方法和状态空间方程，直接从数据中构建Koopman算子，从而优化模型性能及简化计算。

Result: 实验表明，FlightKooba在内存消耗和训练时间方面表现优异，在多数数据集上内存减少超50%，参数量减少十倍。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为快速计算Koopman算子提供了一种新方法，并在时间序列预测与控制结合方面呈现新可能性。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

Conclusion: RF-SNN架构显著提升了时间序列处理中的能效，并在保持准确率的同时减少了计算与通信成本。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many
edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate
streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured
by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper
investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs
resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain
signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By
resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral
features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity
translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission
energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike
transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance
on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and
total energy consumption during inference and communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常采用汇总的眼动跟踪数据和带有强假设的模型，未能全面描述阅读过程中时空动态特征，亟需一种更为通用且细致的建模方法。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于标记时空点过程的阅读行为概率模型，利用Hawkes过程捕捉视线在时空中的激发模式，并用卷积函数建模视线的持续时间及其溢出效应。同时以上下文中语言信息的“意外性”作为模型预测因子之一。

Result: 实验证明所提出的Hawkes过程模型在模拟人类的跳视行为上相比基线方法表现更佳。对于视线的持续时间，加入上下文意外性预测因子仅带来边际改进，表明其理论在解释眼动微观细节时存在局限性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了基于Hawkes过程模型的优势，并挑战了传统“意外性”理论在解释精细眼部活动上的有效性，为阅读行为研究提供了新视角和工具。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分考虑带宽、CPU频率与用户感知之间的因果关系，限制了QoE的提升。

Method: 提出基于韦伯-费希纳定律的QoE指标，将QoE优化建模为混合整数规划任务，设计了部分状态因果深度确定性策略梯度（PS-CDDPG）算法，通过因果推断提高训练效率。

Result: 实验证明该框架显著降低交互延迟，提升QoE并保持公平性，表现优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多用户VR场景中通过优化资源分配和因果决策显著改善了用户体验。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

Conclusion: 这一框架为机器学习即服务中的实时遗忘任务提供了一种高效、实际的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为DeKA-g的算法，通过云端与边缘设备之间的知识蒸馏与对齐，提高生成语义通信（GSC）的效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为AI生成内容（AIGC）的激增，从云向边缘和移动用户传输数据给网络带来巨大压力，因此需要一种能够压缩信息传输的解决方案。

Method: 提出一种名为DeKA-g的知识对齐算法，包括元词辅助知识蒸馏（MAKD）和可变速率分组信噪比适配（VGSA）两种方法，分别提升知识蒸馏效率和适应不同信道条件的能力。

Result: DeKA-g在边缘与云端生成图像的一致性上提升了44%，在压缩效率上提升了116%，在低信噪比场景下性能提升了28%。

Conclusion: DeKA-g在解决生成语义通信中知识对齐问题上表现出优异效果，可以显著改善AIGC数据传输的效率和性能。

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Motivation: 传统经济计量方法在分析电力市场及其价格驱动上能力有限，而深度神经网络在处理复杂数据和关系上更具优势。

Method: 运用深度神经网络预测电力市场价格，通过结合SHAP、梯度方法以及可视化技术（如热图），分析五个电力市场中不同特征的行为与贡献。此外，引入SSHAP值和SSHAP线的概念，以更好表示高维表格模型。

Result: 模型成功预测了电力市场价格，并通过SSHAP值显著提升了对高维数据的解释能力。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合深度学习与可解释性方法能够改进对电力市场价格动态的理解，并为领域研究提供新的解析工具。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

<details>

Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断、自动驾驶）中出错可能造成严重后果，因此需要一种有效的方法来测量并缓解这些错误中的不确定性。

Method: 提出一个基于后处理的不确定性评估框架，通过检索与输入数据激活向量相似的训练样本，计算两种新指标——决策变化和层级不确定性，来量化各层的类别分布变化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集测试中，该方法在处理具有挑战性的分类任务时提升了不确定性估计效果，优于传统的基于SoftMax的置信度估算方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合层级激活的训练样本信息，该方法有效提升了神经网络在复杂分类任务中的不确定性估计能力，具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded

covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most
taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded
in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational

require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments.
This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in
machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of
bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed
in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning
models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped
with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands
highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's
potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive

TL;DR: 该研究对比了自回归（AR）模型和蒙版扩散模型（MDM），分析了其框架和架构差异的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AR模型和MDM通常使用不同的架构（分别为解码器和编码器架构），使得对比其性能时难以区分是由模型范式还是架构引起的差异。本研究旨在公平对比这些模型并提供相关设计启示。

Method: 将MDM置于解码器架构中，进行公平对比，同时探讨不同架构对MDM的影响。还优化了标准AO-AR目标函数以调整无信息的token置换。

Result: 研究显示，解码器架构下的MDM比编码器更快（生成速度提升约25倍），并且通过温度退火可以实现与编码器架构可比较的困惑度，尽管其建模空间更大。

Conclusion: 研究剖析了范式差异与架构的独立影响，为未来语言模型设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有办法在评估特征重要性时，常忽略特征组的联合信号，而在许多情况下，最显著的预测器来自特征组的组合效果，而非单一特征。

Method: 提出了一种高效且无需模型重训的特征组重要性评估方法，支持后定义特征组、组内特征可重叠且适用于高维场景；并在统计上与解释变量分析建立了联系。

Result: 通过三个合成实验验证了方法在不同数据条件下的适用性；通过案例研究表明，特征组分析在医学问题诊断中能提供比单一特征更为全面的见解。

Conclusion: 特征组重要性分析揭示了更具洞察力的关联关系，在医学和其他多模态数据问题中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in
interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related
features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the
joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most
significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined
effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets
that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This
paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of
features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no
model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups,
and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition
offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase
properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the
behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate
the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a
multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social
determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies
reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of
the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

Motivation: 应对多模态复杂数据集增长的需求，提取高效、可解释的结构化知识。

Result: HERCULES展现出从复杂数据集中提取有意义分层知识的潜力。

Conclusion: HERCULES增强了解复杂数据集的能力，为数据分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Conclusion: 通过改进遗憾近似和显式的任务关系建模，TRACED实现了样本高效的课程设计，为无监督环境设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Result: 框架在IBM量子硬件和Qiskit Aer模拟器上的实时训练中实现了约90%的准确率，大幅高于传统方法的约55%。

Conclusion: 通过收敛自适应的优化和泛化能力，该研究克服了传统量子联邦学习在异质性环境中的核心局限性，尤其在医疗健康及基因组研究领域显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using
complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values.
However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter
datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex,
heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for
training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially
masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern
clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees
to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through
extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water
districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM
outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower
processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a
large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly
less inference time.

Method: 提出了Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models（ERDM），透過改進EDM的噪聲計畫、網絡預處理與取樣，結合以下關鍵方法：1. 全新的損失加權機制；2. 基於預訓練EDM的高效初始化策略；3. 混合序列架構進行空間-時間特徵提取。

Conclusion: ERDM框架有效結合滾動預測結構和高性能擴散技術，為處理高不確定性序列生成問題提供了靈活、強大的解決方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

Motivation: 在模型在训练数据中存在偏差的背景下，研究者希望找到一种方法提高模型对各种类别的公平性表现，特别是在模型大小和数据不可分性介于两端极端之间的情况。

Method: 研究重点在最后一层重新训练(LLR)的情境下，对损失权重进行调整以适应模型的相对超参数化程度，评估其理论和实践上的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，在LLR环境中调整损失权重仍是有效的，但需要根据模型的相对超参数化程度来决定权重设置。

Conclusion: 在模型大小适中的重新训练情况中，适当的损失权重调整是减少偏差影响并确保模型公平性的关键。

Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at
scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come
under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes
of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population
(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable
overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal
performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer
retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently
inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two
aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting
is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into
account the relative overparameterization of the model.

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices,
which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues
such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require
the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices.
Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is
critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge
proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized
edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms
explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible
with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and
memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our
approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices,
maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification
framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in
personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures
verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge
devices.

Motivation: 解决跨层信息的线性混合和冗余问题，揭示Transformer层中特征的演化方式。

Result: 提出的框架能够有效压缩和解释跨层残差流中的重复特征，提供更清晰的语义结构。

Conclusion: 通过CLVQVAE框架，能够在语言模型中更深入地理解跨层概念的形成及其进化。

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

*Soheil Abadifard,Fazli Can*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种创新方法，将局部敏感哈希与随机超平面投影（LSH-RHP）集成到动态集成多样化（DynED）框架中，用于解决多分类不平衡数据流的分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于不平衡数据流的数据分类方法多集中于二分类领域，而多分类的非平稳不平衡数据流面临动态平衡比率和大规模数据集的挑战。

Method: 文章利用LSH-RHP进行欠采样，生成平衡训练集，并结合DynED框架提升分类性能。

Result: 在23个真实数据集和10个半合成数据集的实验中，该方法在Kappa和mG-Mean指标上优于15种先进方法，并表现出对大规模高维数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LSH-DynED为处理多类别不平衡数据流提供了有效的解决方案，同时为未来研究指出了方向，并公开了代码以保证可重复性。

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有方法如贝叶斯方法和集成方法，尽管可以量化预测的不确定性，但计算复杂且成本高；尤其是集成方法中的分歧指标不能很好地捕捉模型间的多样性。但在医疗领域，量化信任度和不确定性又至关重要。

Result: 通过在MIMIC-IV和Enzymes两种数据集上的实验验证，这种新方法在区分分布外数据能力、精确性及性能方面不亚于MC Dropout和传统集成方法，并有效捕捉预测不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率，是量化GNN预测不确定性的有效工具。代码已开源促进后续研究。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: We investigate the use of randomly generated data for the sake of
pre-training a model. We justify this approach theoretically from the
perspective of algorithmic complexity, building on recent research that shows
that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We
derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that
synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data
is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show
zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this
performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data,
and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence
and better generalization.

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning
remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction
datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively
from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs
to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the
agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data
and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this
open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified
instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single
policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax
environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction
coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided
open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 论文验证了基于低秩矩阵和张量分解的表型识别法在 UC 和高缺失性 PROs 数据上的成功应用，并表明 PROs 数据包含许多可用于预测用药坚持性的相关信息。

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify
different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix
and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with
multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial
for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially
in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported
symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than
other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping
and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of
computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a
novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which
integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict
medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based
method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the
UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework
that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us
to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts
changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and
0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes
consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal
patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be
successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We
identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes
include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant
infromation that is usually discarded.

Conclusion: 研究提供了对不同PdM方法的优势和妥协的深入认知，并建议从实践角度开展进一步研究以推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern
industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability
and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life
cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise
forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many
studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone
comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In
this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more
strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in
prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL,
classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure
across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent
literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance
and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid
approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and
compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and
build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may
include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets,
benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM
research.

Conclusion: MEL方法能够在资源受限和易失败的边缘环境中提供一种高效且灵活的推理容错框架，为下一代边缘推理服务提供了重要支持。

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency
services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and
susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as
cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,
limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this
paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for
resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup
models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple
servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good
accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective
optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages
diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,
while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical
evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides
performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault
tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show
that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar
performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of
failures when trained using MEL.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate.
Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring
critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency.
Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is
valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However,
ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire,
resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of
a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating
large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves
significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized
models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables
rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate
its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and
Palisades).

Motivation: 在数据驱动的因果网络重构中，识别纯原因或驱动变量至关重要。现有方法（2022年Kathari和Tangirala提出）对仅包含动态关系的系统有效，但无法处理具有代数关系或反馈控制的系统。

Method: 提出了变量划分（PoV）方法，结合动态迭代主成分分析（DIPCA）来确定代数和动态关系的数目以及约束矩阵，并通过计算矩阵条件数划分子集。

Result: PoV方法能够扩展应用范围，不仅适用于纯动态系统，还能处理线性时不变的微分代数系统，并识别因果驱动变量的最小子集。

Conclusion: PoV方法改进了现有因果发现方法的能力，增强了其应用范围和准确性，为因果网络构建提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该研究将因果PDE发现定位为一个基于结构因果模型和变分残差分析的可解读推断任务，为领域提供了一个理论与实践兼备的新视角。

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial
differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and
counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse
regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through
functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal
sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of
candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we
prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry
or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing
identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and
real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows.
Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise,
redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in
structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable
and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and
variational residual analysis.

Motivation: LLMs性能强大但内存和计算成本高，现有剪枝方法未充分利用运行时的激活稀疏性。

Method: 提出DuoGPT框架，通过非结构化权重剪枝结合激活稀疏，扩展OBC框架进行激活感知校准，并引入密集模型的输出残差作为校正项。同时优化GPU执行以支持大规模参数。

Result: DuoGPT在LLaMA-2和LLaMA-3上的表现优于最新的结构化剪枝方法，在相同速度加速下精度提高最多9.17%。

Conclusion: DuoGPT通过动态分布式稀疏优化LLMs效率，在保持精度的同时显著降低成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to
deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these
demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We
reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and
propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV)
workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To
preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with
activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense
model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU
execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on
LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$
compared to the baseline dense model.

Conclusion: Anubis工具有效解決了語言模型生成代碼的歸因問題，展示了高效性和準確性，為未來相關研究提供了可能的方向。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Conclusion: FedBKD框架在实现全局与本地模型性能兼顾的同时，消除了引入公共数据集带来的数据隐私泄漏风险，展现出广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID
data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However,
existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which
represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the
Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the
knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared
information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client
as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL
framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each
client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert
distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of
fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared
knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation
methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater
flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among
cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,
highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing
personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，训练数据中复杂的交互作用是模型记忆的主要来源，而非单独的自我影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究训练数据中的记忆化问题，特别是模型如何受到训练数据中样本相互影响的机制影响。

Method: 将计量记忆化的反事实自我影响扩展为一个分布量，分析训练样本之间的完全影响分布及其性质。

Result: 发现(几乎)重复样本会显著影响模型记忆，同时降低自我影响值，这种情况下记忆样本仍然容易被提取。此外，通过影响分布还发现CIFAR-10中存在(几乎)重复样本。

Conclusion: 单看自我影响可能低估记忆化风险，记忆化更多是训练数据复杂交互的结果，应通过完全影响分布来更好地理解。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

Motivation: 研究输入敏感性中等的学习函数，并探索学习模型在QR码解码中的有效性。

Result: Transformer模型成功解码QR码，超越理论纠错极限，并在多种语言间以及随机字符串中广泛推广。

Conclusion: Transformer可以通过学习数据位的结构有效解码QR码，并表现出与传统解码方法不同的机制。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Motivation: 当前的off-policy方法尽管实现简单且数据效率高，但在表现上往往次于on-policy技术；本文旨在研究具体的off-policy机制并优化其性能。

Method: 引入基于$r-V$的off-policy REINFORCE算法，其中$V$是可调的基线，通过调整$V$值控制对高奖励样本的强化和对低奖励样本的惩罚。

Result: 理论分析表明，当基线$V$低于期望奖励时，该算法具有策略改进的保证；实验验证显示在受控的随机老虎机环境和语言模型的微调任务中有良好表现。

Conclusion: 通过调整强化学习的基线值，可以改进off-policy算法的性能，同时验证了算法在理论与实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: ILDE结合探索奖励与状态偏离探索，实现了更快的专家策略收敛，同时具备潜在超越专家性能的能力。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA尽管是流行的大模型微调方法，但其适配器放置策略研究有限。现有工作对放置在注意力模块或MLP模块的效果尚无定论，亟需更精确的方法优化适配器放置位置。

Method: 通过一种理论分析的方法，提出PLoP来自动识别LoRA适配器在预训练模型模块中的最佳放置位置，无需人工选择。

Result: 实验表明，PLoP在监督微调及强化学习任务中的表现优于现有的通常放置策略，即使在最差情况下也不逊色。

Conclusion: PLoP方法显著优化了适配器放置策略，为LoRA方法提供了更高效、更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs提升了效率及泛化能力，是对动态图建模的重要改进。

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between
evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where
users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated
by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve
desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation
session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles.
Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact
solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two
heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that
determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality.
Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and
limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair
bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

Method: 该方法提出通过对比在使用所有时间序列数据的情况下与去掉某一具体时间序列变量模型的残差分布，来揭示学习到的GC结构。并通过对输入层的dropout比较其对深度学习模型学GC能力的影响，而无需通过损失函数添加显式的变量选择或稀疏回归项。

Result: 实验结果表明，在具备充足训练数据的情况下，一个良好正则化的深度学习模型可以学得真实的Granger因果关系结构。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型可以通过联合建模时间序列数据自发地学习Granger因果关系结构，而无需依赖传统方法中的显式变量选择。

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为DipSVD的双层重要性保护机制，以提高SVD压缩法的性能，特别是在高压缩比的情况下效果显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的计算需求和部署成本高昂，SVD压缩因其硬件兼容性和理论保证受到关注，但现有方法未充分考虑压缩过程中对重要矩阵成分的保护。

Method: 提出双层重要性保护机制：(1) 局部重要性保护，通过信道加权数据白化方法保留权重矩阵的关键奇异向量。(2) 全局重要性保护，通过启发式或优化方法让不重要的层承担更多的压缩负担，从而减轻对关键层的影响。

Result: DipSVD在多个基准测试中优于现有的SVD压缩方法，特别是在高模型压缩比时表现更为出色。

Conclusion: DipSVD的双层重要性保护机制能够有效提升SVD压缩方法性能，实现高压缩比下的优异模型表现。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also
of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves
through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the
significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,
resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and
predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced
feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of
the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome
this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,
the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection
method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This
approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further
categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The
comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently
achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the
taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select
features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights
into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study
provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add
a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational
complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step
toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners
dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of
explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted
augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear
scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new

democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: P4为物联网中的资源受限设备提供了一种高效、鲁棒、私密的个性化学习解决方案，在实验中展现出卓越性能和实际可行性。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Result: 实验结果表明，OPFV 在非平稳场景下的政策价值评估和优化显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OPFV 有效解决了在非平稳环境下进行未来政策评估和优化的挑战，为相关场景的政策学习提供了具有前景的方法。

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

Motivation: 在大规模客户端的联邦学习中，仅有少量客户端参与训练时，传统方法性能下降明显，需新的方法应对该挑战。

Method: 提出了KDIA策略，其中学生模型为参与客户端的平均聚合，教师模型通过基于参与频率等多因素加权聚合，结合自知识蒸馏和服务器生成的IID数据特征辅助训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10等数据集和异质设定下展示了KDIA在提高准确性和减少训练轮次上的优势。

Conclusion: KDIA在异质性强的联邦学习环境下取得显著效果，具有重要实践意义。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment
that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such
as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems
severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the
scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a
large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario
presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a
Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)
strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,
which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student
model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the
teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three
frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume
proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.
Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate
approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features
locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate
KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds
of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to
learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the
loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at
so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the
latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling
refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for
approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered
function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points
during the training process of PINNs.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the

automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning
framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized
location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping
medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In
this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware
usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware
they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them,
their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration.
Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we
use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best
training settings across all participants. Our results show that against
default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying
nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which
allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains
private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where
data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been
extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among
others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against
other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods.
An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of
incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for
participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and
thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific
tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to
address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to
create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for
participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation
learning process.

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决传统有限元分析在LPBF仿真中计算成本高的问题。

Method: 开发了动态材料更新策略与FEA调节物理信息神经网络（FEA-PINN）框架，包含热容法建模相变行为，并通过有限元校正实现物理一致性并减少误差累积。

Result: FEA-PINN相较于传统FEA能够显著降低计算成本，同时保持了相当的精度，并在基准数据和LPBF单轨扫描验证中得到了证明。

Conclusion: FEA-PINN框架有效地结合了精确性与高效性，为LPBF过程的热场预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such
as data centers, cloud computing networks, and service systems. By means of a
case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical
implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for
optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently
learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark
policies, indicating its potential for live implementation. We also augment the
real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic
routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can
optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary
objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can
be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance
trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and
parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing
algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across
various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics
detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults
occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and
the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we
investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection,
focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions
are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series
anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window
size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods
for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss
appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of
anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of
alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a
comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse
set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨图神经网络（GNN）在分布偏移场景下的性能，发现图转换模型（Graph Transformer, GT）和混合GT-MPNN方法展现出更强的泛化能力，并提出了一种新的后训练分析方式来更深入理解其泛化性能。

Motivation: 当前GNN方法常假设训练和测试数据具有相同的分布，这在实际场景中往往难以实现，亟需解决GNN在分布偏移情况下的泛化问题，特别是骨干架构的影响。

Method: 系统评估了图转换模型（GT）和混合GT-MPNN骨干架构在分布偏移场景下的表现，结合域泛化算法设计了新的基准测试，并提出了一种后训练数据结构分析方法，用于理解分布对齐与类别分离。

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous
applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and
recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods
frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the
same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While
graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional
message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)
benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of
backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in
OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading
domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their
performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.
Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently
demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without
specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that
compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,
specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its
model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into
GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG
problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization
abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings
highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph
learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

*Mariano Tepper,Ted Willke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用机器学习方法，提出一种适用于度量和非度量向量空间的图索引方法SVG，具有形式化的导航性保证，并进一步提出了改进版本SVG-L0。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图索引主要基于计算几何方法，仅在欧几里得空间中具有导航性保证，因此需要一种适用于更广泛向量空间的图索引方法。

Method: 利用核方法建立支持向量图（SVG）的连接性，并提出加入$\ell_0$稀疏性约束的改进方法SVG-L0，以实现有限出度的图结构。

Result: 证明SVG在度量和非度量空间中均具有形式化的导航性保证，同时SVG-L0在保持计算复杂度的情况下具备自调节性能，避免了传统启发式方法的局限。

Conclusion: SVG提供了一种适用于更多空间类型的通用图索引框架，而SVG-L0进一步优化了实践需求，为图导航性工具提供了一种更加理论化和系统化的方法。

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from
computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph
navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we
show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search
in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity).
From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new
type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph
connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric
and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph
indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and
show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this
specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$
sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded
out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical
requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the
out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning
property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the
out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

Method: 设计了一种新的符号学习方法H-FEX，引入了新的交互节点以捕获复杂的交互项，从观测数据中直接学习哈密顿函数。

Result: 实验表明H-FEX能有效恢复复杂系统的哈密顿函数，准确表现系统动态特性并在长期内保持能量守恒。

Conclusion: H-FEX为发现复杂动力系统的封闭形式表达提供了一个强有力的框架。

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by
Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution
of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural
network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of
dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems.
However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian
functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX),
a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to
capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including
those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover
Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system
dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight
the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form
expressions of complex dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 闭环学习可能放大初始偏差，但通过适当方法干预，可以减轻这些问题，并且模型重参数化会影响这种方法的表现。

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from
data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to
the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be
primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves.
We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving
equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics
with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to
absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we
show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an
infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying
on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.
Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not
reparametrisation invariant.

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being
trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through
Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of
network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices,
leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To
address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge
devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).
FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data
encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other
clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and
encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's
local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the
model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning
training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it
suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid
convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model
performance.

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally
assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their
accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural
language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and
medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to
optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency
properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient
algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open
questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and
Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and
deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a
fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a
family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove
$H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new
surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency
bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural
assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced
theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally,
we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses,
comparing their performance against existing baselines.

Result: 发现梯度泄露攻击在现实联邦学习场景中难以同时高效且隐蔽，并验证了采用常见的归一化技术与联邦平均有助于防御攻击的可行性。

Conclusion: 在实际中，梯度泄露攻击难以高效操作且容易被检测，通过基本监控和轻量客户端检测机制即可有效防御，保障用户数据隐私。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This
risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the
global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper,
we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis
of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques
that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks
cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently
stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that
incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,
while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often
detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we
propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection
mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,
despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic
FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending
against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard
for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

Abstract: We report a higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine that exhibits superior
scalability compared to architectures based on quadratization, while also
achieving state-of-the-art quality and reliability in solutions with
competitive time-to-solution metrics. At the core of the proposed machine is an
asynchronous autoencoder architecture that captures higher-order interactions
by directly manipulating Ising clauses instead of Ising spins, thereby
maintaining resource complexity independent of interaction order. Asymptotic
convergence to the Ising ground state is ensured by sampling the autoencoder
latent space defined by the spins, based on the annealing dynamics of the
Fowler-Nordheim quantum mechanical tunneling. To demonstrate the advantages of
the proposed higher-order neuromorphic Ising machine, we systematically solved
benchmark combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-SAT,
comparing the results to those obtained using a second-order Ising machine
employing the same annealing process. Our findings indicate that the proposed
architecture consistently provides higher quality solutions in shorter time
frames compared to the second-order model across multiple runs. Additionally,
we show that the techniques based on the sparsity of the interconnection
matrix, such as graph coloring, can be effectively applied to higher-order
neuromorphic Ising machines, enhancing the solution quality and the
time-to-solution. The time-to-solution can be further improved through hardware
co-design, as demonstrated in this paper using a field-programmable gate array
(FPGA). The results presented in this paper provide further evidence that
autoencoders and Fowler-Nordheim annealers are sufficient to achieve
reliability and scaling of any-order neuromorphic Ising machines.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often incorporate multi-branch
connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and enhancing the capture
of diverse features. This design improves network capacity and generalisation
to unseen data. However, training such DNNs can be computationally expensive.
The challenge is further exacerbated by the complexity of identifying optimal
network architectures. To address this, we leverage Evolutionary Algorithms
(EAs) to automatically discover high-performing architectures, a process
commonly known as neuroevolution. We introduce a novel approach based on Linear
Genetic Programming (LGP) to encode multi-branch (MB) connections within DNNs,
referred to as NeuroLGP-MB. To efficiently design the DNNs, we use
surrogate-assisted EAs. While their application in simple artificial neural
networks has been influential, we scale their use from dozens or hundreds of
sample points to thousands, aligning with the demands of complex DNNs by
incorporating a semantic-based approach in our surrogate-assisted EA.
Furthermore, we introduce a more advanced surrogate model that outperforms
baseline, computationally expensive, and simpler surrogate models.
