Motivation: 解决在多视角捕获中，由于外观变化导致的城市场景重建及渲染不一致性问题，同时追求高效和高质量的解决方案。

Method: 采用场景分割并行训练和基于可见性图像选择策略优化训练效率；通过可控细节层次策略调控高斯密度；引入外观转换模块减少外观不一致性并支持灵活调整；融合深度正则化、比例正则化和抗锯齿等增强模块提高重建质量。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

### [3] [Adaptive Time-step Training for Enhancing Spike-Based Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23033)
*Ranxi Lin,Canming Yao,Jiayi Li,Weihang Liu,Xin Lou,Pingqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的新方法，用于改进NeRF模型在场景渲染中的效率，大幅降低了计算资源的消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF模型在3D重建和渲染任务中表现出色，但其对多重视角光线的高密度采样需求导致计算资源消耗较高，限制了其在资源受限场景中的使用。

Method: 本文提出了一个称为PATA的动态时间步长训练策略，用于脉冲神经网络的渲染框架，在训练过程中动态调整时间步长度以优化渲染质量和计算资源之间的权衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，PATA方法能够在保留渲染质量的同时，将推理时间步长减少64%，运行功耗降低61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA方法通过结合脉冲神经网络和动态时间步策略，实现了在不同场景自适应的高效渲染，显示出在资源受限环境中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

### [4] [Modeling Human Gaze Behavior with Diffusion Models for Unified Scanpath Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23021)
*Giuseppe Cartella,Vittorio Cuculo,Alessandro D'Amelio,Marcella Cornia,Giuseppe Boccignone,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ScanDiff，一种结合扩散模型与视觉Transformer的新方法，能够生成多样且逼真的人类注视路线，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注视路线预测方法难以捕捉人类视觉探索的多样性，且多数生成的是平均化的注视行为。

Method: 结合扩散模型的随机特性和视觉Transformer，ScanDiff能显式地建模注视路线的多样性，同时融入任务驱动的文本条件生成机制。

Result: ScanDiff在基准数据集上的自由观看和任务驱动场景测试中表现优于最新方法，生成更为多样和精确的注视路线。

Conclusion: ScanDiff更好地捕捉了人类视觉行为的复杂性，为注视预测研究带来了重要进展。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

### [5] [Recovering Diagnostic Value: Super-Resolution-Aided Echocardiographic Classification in Resource-Constrained Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23027)
*Krishan Agyakari Raja Babu,Om Prabhu,Annu,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了深度学习超分辨率技术在提升低质量心脏超声图像分类准确性方面的潜力，尤其是在资源受限环境（RCS）下的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境的心脏分析经常受到低质量超声图像的阻碍，需探索方法提高图像质量以促进后续诊断模型的有效性。

Method: 通过使用公开的CAMUS数据集，将图像按质量分层，并评估两项分类任务的表现。结合SRGAN和SRResNet两种超分辨模型对图像进行增强，改善低质量心脏超声图像的分类准确性。

Result: 结果表明，SRResNet在性能提升上表现尤为显著，并具有计算高效性，可显著提升低质量超声图像的诊断能力。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术可以有效恢复低质量心脏超声图像的诊断价值，为资源受限环境中AI辅助医疗提供了一种经济可行的工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

### [6] [Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive 是一种单分支的视觉-语言架构，通过整合多种输入并设计新的平滑损失函数，实现了实时推理，可显著提升自动驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆在复杂路况中需要快速反应并推断问题。

Method: 提出一种单分支架构（NovaDrive），结合前置摄像图像、高清地图、LiDAR 深度和文本路径点并通过两阶段跨注意力模块进行处理。

Result: 在 MD-NEX Outdoor 基准测试的 nuScenes/Waymo 子集上，成功率提高到 84%，路径效率提高到 0.66，碰撞频率从 2.6% 降至 1.2%。

Conclusion: NovaDrive 不仅提高了自动驾驶的安全性和效率，还具有延展性，并且新设计的平滑损失函数有助于降低燃料或电池消耗。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [7] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了MObI和AnydoorMed两种方法，分别用于自动驾驶和医疗图像分析中的合成数据生成，提高了数据的现实性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据的生成被认为是因为真实数据采集成本高且复杂，特别是在自动驾驶和医学图像分析的安全关键应用中。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型在视觉模态中实现多模态的对象修补，并结合3D边界框引导确保空间定位和比例的真实性；AnydoorMed则将其扩展到医学领域，以高细节精度修补乳房X线扫描中的异常，同时保持结构完整和语义一致。

Result: 生成的多模态合成数据能够实现高现实性与高可控性，证明了基础模型可适应不同模态并保有较高的效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法可以用于实现更真实、可控并支持多模态的生成数据，为未来生成反事实场景系统的发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

### [8] [Vision-Language Fusion for Real-Time Autonomous Driving: Goal-Centered Cross-Attention of Camera, HD-Map, & Waypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23064)
*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan,Murari Ambati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive 是一个单一的视觉-语言模型，通过前置摄像头帧、25m x 25m 的俯视地图和下一步目标点输出驾驶决策，表现超过现有模型，强调早期融合的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中几何精度和语义理解分离处理的问题，以提升理解和决策效率。

Method: 提出了XYZ-Drive，一个整合了视觉、目标点和地图信息的跨注意力机制，通过部分微调的LLaMA-3.2模型进行车辆控制和解释。

Result: 在MD-NEX基准上，XYZ-Drive取得了95%成功率和0.80 SPL，性能比PhysNav-DG高15%，碰撞率减半，同时提升效率。

Conclusion: 早期融合意图和地图布局的token-level方法对于实现精确、透明和实时的自动驾驶具有重要意义。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

### [9] [Vocabulary-free Fine-grained Visual Recognition via Enriched Contextually Grounded Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23070)
*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练无关的方法E-FineR，用于细粒度图像分类，依赖语言驱动理解，不需要固定词汇和人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像分类方法限制在固定词汇和闭集分类，难以适应真实场景中新类别的出现。

Method: 提出E-FineR方法，结合大语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs），实现训练无关的细粒度视觉识别。

Result: E-FineR在零样本和小样本分类中表现优越，与现有SOTA性能水平相当。

Conclusion: E-FineR展现了处理实际场景和新领域问题的潜力，通过无依赖的方式支持从标签预测向语言驱动理解的转变，实现可扩展的、通用系统。

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

### [10] [Details Matter for Indoor Open-vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23134)
*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，将多个开放词汇3D实例分割（OV-3DIS）概念结合，通过双阶段方案实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法中的多个概念是互补的，需要一种方式将它们结合优化，解决关键挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：首先利用鲁棒的3D跟踪提议聚合生成3D实例，使用迭代合并/删除去掉重复或部分实例；分类阶段采用Alpha-CLIP模型替代标准CLIP，引入对象掩码作为alpha通道降低背景噪声，并提出标准化最大相似度(SMS)得分以提高精度。

Result: 在ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上表现优异，在AP和AR指标上均达到最先进水平，且超过了封闭词汇方法。

Conclusion: 该方法结合多种概念设计新型OV-3DIS框架，充分解决了现有挑战，展现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-NeMo 提出一种零样本扩散式肖像动画方法，通过静态肖像和驱动视频来生成生动的面部动画，解决了身份泄露及表情捕捉不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中的身份泄露和无法捕捉细微与极端表情的问题。

Method: 提出一个端到端训练框架，通过从驱动图像中提取1D身份无关的隐式运动描述符，以跨注意力方式控制运动，同时结合双GAN解码器、空间和颜色增强来提升表现力。

Result: X-NeMo 输出高度生动的动画，具有优越的身份相似性，超越了最先进的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种创新的端到端肖像动画生成方法，实现了面部表情的细腻呈现和对身份泄露的有效抑制。

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经反向渲染方法，可从多视角图像中联合重建几何、反射率和光照条件，而无需光源校准或中间结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多视角光度立体方法需要光源校准或中间线索的问题，实现从原始多视角图像联合优化场景参数。

Method: 将几何和反射率表示为神经隐式场，采用阴影感知的体渲染技术并设计了空间网络和反射率网络进行参数预测及估计。

Result: 相比现有的法向量引导方法，该方法在形状和光照估计精度方面表现更好，还能处理更复杂的几何和反射率场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需光源校准的情况下，实现了多视角图像的精确逆向渲染，展现了其在复杂场景中的优势。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单张图像雨条纹去除问题，同时保护图像细节与整体视觉质量。

Method: 引入Corner Loss避免边界和细节丢失，采用R-CBAM模块动态调整空间和通道的重要性。

Result: 实验在Rain100L和Rain100H数据集上验证了方法优越性，分别取得PSNR为33.29 dB和26.16 dB。

Conclusion: 提出的方法相比以前的技术表现更优，能有效去除雨条纹并保留图像细节。

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Method: 通过细粒度的序列级别对比学习，将四种模态（文本、音频、视频、动作）对齐到一个联合嵌入空间，同时创建了两个多模态动作检索数据集以进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，在包括HumanML3D数据集的多项子任务中，该框架优于已有的先进方法，例如在文本到动作检索的R@10指标上提高了10.16%，在视频到动作检索的R@1指标上提高了25.43%。

Conclusion: 多模态动作检索框架，包括音频模态的引入，相较于传统的三模态框架显著提升了性能，展示了多模态在推动动作获取领域中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be
publicly available on

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法，生成带有对抗性语义且抗防御能力强的图像以欺骗多模态大型语言模型。

Motivation: 利用扩散模型生成对抗样本，对多模态大型语言模型实施更有效的攻击，同时保持图片的原始质量，克服传统方法只能依赖高频扰动的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为对抗引导扩散（AGD）的方法，引入对抗引导噪声，将目标语义注入扩散过程中的噪声分量，与低频分量线性结合以生成对抗图像，从而优化对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AGD方法在攻击性能和对抗模型防御能力方面优于现有最先进的技术。

Conclusion: AGD方法通过在扩散噪声中注入目标语义，生成了抗防御能力强的对抗图像。这种方法为更有效的多模态语言模型对抗攻击提供了新的思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于结晶团聚中水的透明性质，通过显微镜图像进行手动标注存在困难，因此需要一种自动化的方法来更好地识别和分析团聚。

Method: 提出了一种监督基线模型用于生成分割伪标签，并结合了一个实例分类模型共同进行分类和像素级分割。此外，还设计了一个后处理模块以保留晶体特性，并结合两者的优势提升推断阶段效果。

Result: 相比现有方法，新方法在团聚分类的真阳性率和颗粒尺寸分布预测上有显著提升；并在不同信心等级下有效分类潜在团聚实例。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合分类与分割优势，解决了手动标注难度大及团聚分类效果不佳的问题，为食品质量分析提供了更准确、更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

TL;DR: 该论文提出轻量级模型YOLO-ROC，解决现有道路损坏检测中多尺度特征提取能力不足及模型高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法无法充分提取多尺度特征，导致小规模损坏检测误检率高，同时主流模型计算量大，不适用于实时检测。

Method: 设计双向多尺度空间金字塔池化快速模块（BMS-SPPF）提升特征提取能力，引入分层通道压缩策略降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，YOLO-ROC在RDD2022_China_Drone数据集上mAP50达到67.6%，较YOLOv8n提升2.11%，小目标检测性能提升显著，模型仅2.0 MB。

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在实现高准确性能的同时，具有低计算需求和优异的泛化性能，可广泛应用于实际场景。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

*Fan Lyu,Linglan Zhao,Chengyan Liu,Yinying Mei,Zhang Zhang,Jian Zhang,Fuyuan Hu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的领域GSemi-FSCIL，并用ALDC方法解决了现有方法在样本分布校正上的挑战，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Semi-FSCIL研究中，未标注数据仅限于当前新增类，这与实际场景不符。

Method: 通过提出一种基于模糊指导的可学习分布校正策略(ALDC)，利用丰富的基本类样本动态校准少样本新增类的特征分布。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，并达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: ALDC策略有效克服了GSemi-FSCIL场景下未标注数据混合的难题，提出的理念更符合实际场景需求并能提升性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中查询优化的挑战，尤其针对多样化和非结构化的真实世界文档。

Method: 通过合成情景-问题对并使用广义奖励策略优化（GRPO），训练针对特定检索器的查询重写器，无需人工注释，并适用于多模态和单模态数据库。

Result: 在工业级数据中证明了显著的性能提升，多模态检索和词法检索分别提升了11%和9%的性能，但在语义和混合检索领域提升有限。

Conclusion: RL-QR在无需标注的情况下显著提高了RAG系统的检索性能，但语义检索仍需进一步优化，是一个可扩展的查询优化解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Conclusion: 该研究与纤维追踪技术紧密结合，推动了颅神经多对通路的自动化与高效分析，为复杂脑部解剖结构的可视化研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Conclusion: Transformer通过强大的时空建模能力在跟踪领域展现了迅速的进展，本文为理解其发展脉络及其他方法提供了全面参考。

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的时间序列评估指标（TGSI）和关联的训练损失函数（SATL），旨在通过图像表征时间序列的几何结构来提高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数值评价指标如MSE无法捕获时间序列数据的几何结构信息，而这一信息对于理解时间物理特性至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI作为新的度量指标，将时间序列转化为图像以利用其二维几何特性，并引入SATL损失函数（包含三个子部分：基于一阶差分、一阶频域捕捉周期模式、感知特征对准）以提升模型的结构建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标下优于基线方法，同时不增加推理阶段的计算成本。

Conclusion: 本文通过结合TGSI与SATL，提出了一种在保持计算成本的同时实现时间序列几何结构建模增强的方法，对提升时间序列预测性能具有显著意义。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

TL;DR: 本文提出了语义感知阈值学习（SATL）算法，通过计算每一类别中正负样本的分数分布，动态调整类别特定阈值，以提升多标签图像识别性能，尤其在有限标签场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖预设阈值的伪标签生成，往往忽略类别之间分数分布差异，进而影响模型性能。

Method: 提出语义感知阈值学习（SATL）算法，通过对每类别的正负样本分数分布进行计算和动态更新，确定类别特定的阈值，同时引入差异化排序损失，增强正负样本分数分布的区分度。

Result: 在Microsoft COCO和VG-200等大规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有限标签场景下显著提升了多标签图像识别的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的SATL算法有效优化了伪标签生成过程，基于动态更新的类别特定阈值显著提升了识别性能，对于解决有限标签问题具有显著意义。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器依赖于训练后的变分自动编码器(VAE)的潜在空间，但这一两阶段训练方法带来了误差积累和解码伪影的问题。

Method: 提出PixelNerd模型，不借助复杂的级联管道或VAE，而是采用神经场进行patch解码，是一种单级、端到端的高效解决方案。

Result: 在ImageNet $256×256$尺寸上获得2.15 FID，在$512×512$尺寸上获得2.84 FID；在文本生成图像应用中，PixNerd-XXL/16在GenEval基准上获得0.73的整体分数，在DPG基准上获得80.9的整体分数。

Conclusion: PixelNerd成功实现了比传统方法更简单的架构，同时保留甚至提升了生成图像的质量。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工MRI解读费时且主观，而低中收入国家的商用AI医疗产品采用受限。目标是开发一种低成本、输入最少的AI工具，用于乳腺MRI肿瘤分割。

Method: 采用Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)，基于单切片的边界框注释，通过三种切片跟踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、从中心向外）完成3D分割预测传播，并分析了这些策略在一大患者队列中的表现。

Result: 发现中心向外传播策略提供了最一致且准确的分割结果；SAM2在未针对医学数据训练的情况下，是零样本模型，在最低限监督下也能取得强劲表现。

Conclusion: 通用基金模型如SAM2能够在资源有限环境中支持3D医学图像分析，为低成本、可获取的医疗图像分析提供了可能性。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

### [29] [iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277)
*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为iLRM的迭代3D重建模型，通过三项核心原则解决全注意力机制的可扩展性难题，实现高效高质量的3D建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的3D建模方法存在可扩展性问题，计算成本高，因此需要开发一种高质量且高效的3D建模方法。

Method: 提出了一个迭代的3D重建模型iLRM，遵循三个核心原则：(1)将场景表示和输入图像解耦；(2)将全注意力交互分解为两阶段注意力；(3)在每层注入高分辨率信息。

Result: 实验显示iLRM在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上的重建质量和速度均优于现有方法，特别是在输入视图增加的情况下表现出更高的可扩展性和效果。

Conclusion: iLRM在计算成本相近的情况下，通过更高效地利用大量输入视图，提高了3D重建的质量和性能，对3D建模领域有重要贡献。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP，实现理解、重建、生成和编辑功能的统一，并在文本生成和图像编辑任务中取得了领先的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服现有CLIP方法在统一生成和重建任务中性能下降的局限性，同时保持理解能力。

Method: 引入两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，将重建功能集成到CLIP中，并设计双条件架构，增强生成和编辑能力。

Result: 在文本生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上的得分分别为0.87和0.53，在图像编辑任务的ImgEdit基准上得分为3.62，均超越先前同规模模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的应用范围，实现了其在理解、生成和编辑任务中的高效统一表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于文本-视频检索的新框架BLiM，通过双向似然估计和候选优先级归一化提高检索效果，解决了候选优先级偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在长查询和复杂匹配上的优势有限，且存在候选优先级偏差问题。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，利用双向生成技术结合查询和候选的似然性，并引入候选优先级归一化模块（CPN）来校准得分。

Result: 在四个文本-视频检索基准上，BLiM搭配CPN取得了平均6.4 R@1的提升，效果优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了候选优先级偏差，增强了查询与候选相关性的表达，同时CPN具有广泛的多模态任务适用性。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出了Layout Error Detection (LED)，一个评估文档布局预测结构鲁棒性的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标如IoU和mAP不足以检测文档布局中的关键结构错误（如合并、分裂、内容丢失）。

Method: 提出LED基准，定义八种标准错误类型并设计三种互补任务，构建了一个合成数据集LED-Dataset以进行性能评估。

Result: 实验表明，LED能够区分结构理解能力，揭示传统指标未发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局预测提供了全面的评估标准，填补了现有评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散基础的编辑方法在面对大幅度或复杂几何变换时的困难，通过解耦的方式提升编辑的鲁棒性与精度。

Method: 提出一种新的解耦式管道，将物体变换、源区域修补和目标区域精炼分开处理，使用一个无需训练的扩散方法FreeFine完成修补和精炼任务。

Result: 新方法在GeoBench基准测试中证明了高出色性，在图像保真度和编辑精度上超越了现有最先进方法，特别是在复杂变换场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: FreeFine方法展示了显著的潜力，通过解耦的编辑管道提高了几何图像编辑的效果，为未来相关研究提供了一个有效的工具和基准。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效、简洁的半监督伪装目标检测（SSCOD）新方法ST-SAM，通过自训练策略和混合提示技术，在仅1%的标注数据下达到了最先进的表现，同时减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对昂贵的逐像素标注的依赖，同时克服现有SSCOD方法的预测偏差、错误传播以及计算负担问题。

Method: 采用自训练策略动态优化伪标签，同时将伪标签转换为含有领域知识的混合提示，结合Segment Anything Model（SAM）实现单模型训练，减少多模型框架的问题。

Result: 在COD基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，使用1%的标注数据即可超越现有方法，性能甚至可与完全监督方法媲美。

Conclusion: ST-SAM是一种高效的单网络框架，开创了注解高效的SSCOD新范式，减少依赖标注数据的同时显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Conclusion: PriorFusion有效克服复杂环境中道路感知的挑战，结合多种先验信息的手段有助于提升自动驾驶车辆的安全性和决策能力。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Motivation: 探索文字到图像扩散模型内部如何表示内容和风格概念，并揭示模型在生成艺术内容时的工作机制。

Method: 使用交叉注意力热图分析模型如何将生成图像的像素归因于提示词中的不同内容描述词和风格描述词。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了模型如何在无监督条件下对复杂艺术概念进行内部表示的见解，并共享了代码和数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Result: 该方法在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，以不同的裁剪比例实现了当前最优的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效降低计算成本，同时通过保留关键前景信息来提升决策效果，适用于各种视觉编码器的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Conclusion: 通过融合历史和当前查询信息，利用动作潜变量进行状态传播，FASTopoWM框架在时间感知和拓扑推理性能方面显著超越现有方法。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Conclusion: 框架提升了医学图像分割模型对不同行域变化的适应性，为临床环境中的广泛部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决道路表面重建在自主驾驶中因动态遮挡、静态障碍物视觉杂乱及光线和天气变化引起的外观退化问题。

Method: 使用平面适配高斯表示进行大规模建模，基于分割引导的视频修复技术去除动态和静态前景物体，并通过基于HSV空间的语义感知纠正增强色彩一致性。

Result: 在城市规模数据集上进行广泛实验表明，该方法在视觉连贯性和几何准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在真实世界条件下提供了视觉连贯且几何忠实的重建效果，是道路表面重建领域的关键成果。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Motivation: 解决低分辨率图像对面部检测性能的影响问题。

Method: 基于WIDER FACE数据集，使用160x160、320x320、640x640三种分辨率评估YOLOv11、YOLOv12和MTCNN模型，分析其精准率、召回率、mAP等指标的性能表现及推理时间。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下检测精度最佳，YOLOv12在召回率上稍好，MTCNN虽然在特征点定位上有竞争力，但实时推理速度较慢。

Conclusion: 研究成果对选择适合不同操作约束的分辨率感知型面部检测模型提供了实用性洞见。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前生成AI说话者及其合成效果质量有限，而对这类问题的研究还不充足。作者希望填补这一空白，并提升AGTH的质量水平。

Method: 提出了THQA-10K数据集，包括通过12个T2I模型和14个高级说话人生成的10,457个AGTH样本，结合主观评分分析及提出基于首帧、Y-T切片和音唇一致性的新评价方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的评价方法在AGTH质量评估中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 此研究为AGTH的品质分析与提升提供了强有力的工具，填补了生成质量研究的空白。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

Conclusion: 总结这些突破性研究如何构建并推动计算机视觉领域关键设计模式的发展，提升了在图像识别和生成方面的性能，可应用于更大规模的视觉任务。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出并验证了一种改进大型视觉-语言模型(LVLMs)训练效率的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs尽管表现出强大能力，但其大量参数和高计算成本限制了实用性，旨在寻找训练效率更高的解决方案。

Method: 基于现有的层剪枝方法，提出了一个名为Short-LVLM的框架，通过充分利用重要的视觉-语言(VL)标记和减少层间特征差异，实现高效剪枝。

Result: 实验表明，Short-LVLM在性能与效率之间平衡更佳，并且具有无训练需求、模型无关及高度兼容的优点。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM是一种能有效提升LVLMs可用性的无训练压缩方法。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基于学习的特征匹配虽性能优异，但Transformer注意力机制计算复杂度高，效率有限。

Method: 采用混合方法，将Mamba的线性复杂度处理能力和Transformer的注意力机制结合，设计了多种配置以验证有效性。

Conclusion: VMatcher有效平衡了效率与性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Motivation: 情感理解和生成是密切相关的任务，但传统方法通常将其分离。本研究旨在统一这两项任务以达到协同增强。

Method: 设计了一个多层次情感理解机制，利用可学习的专家查询提取多尺度情感特征，并结合扩散模型生成情感诱发图像。同时引入情感相关系数和情感条件损失改进生成质量，并通过生成过程对理解任务提供隐含及显式反馈。

Result: 实验表明，UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务上均显著优于当前最新方法。

Conclusion: UniEmo实现了情感理解与生成任务的有效融合，验证了联合训练和反馈机制的优越性，为情感相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督领域适配中同时对大量伪标签数据进行对齐，导致噪声累积和不稳定性，特别是在多源场景下表现更为明显。

Method: 逐步对齐策略：从高置信度样本开始训练，逐步加入更具挑战性的样本，从而避免初始标签噪声问题，并引导模型逐步学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home以及DomainNet等UDA基准上，所提方法MP^2A相比其他基于CLIP的多源UDA方法表现优越。

Conclusion: 逐步对齐策略有效缓解了确认偏差和噪声传播问题，促进了更稳健的模型收敛，验证了其性能和通用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: NeRF-GS 实验结果优于现有方法，在基准数据集上达到最新性能表现。

Conclusion: NeRF 和 3DGS 彼此互补，通过混合方法为高效 3D 场景表示提供新可能性。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架Adaptive Grouped Alignment（AGA），通过适配性分组对医疗图像和报告的配对数据进行建模，旨在解决当前医疗领域视觉-语言预训练方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于医疗图像和报告的视觉-语言预训练方法过于简化，没有有效捕捉报告的结构化语义。此外，现有对比学习框架依赖于大量的负样本，不适合医疗数据的小样本特点。

Method: AGA框架采用一种基于稀疏相似矩阵的双向分组机制。针对每对图像-报告，计算文本标记与图像块之间的相似度，为每个标记和图像块分别选择其最匹配的组。引入两个动态学习分组阈值的模块并通过加权平均计算分组表示，并结合实例感知对齐损失实现分组对齐。

Result: 实验结果证明，AGA在公开和私有数据集上的图像文本检索和分类任务中表现优越，无论是微调还是零样本设置下。

Conclusion: AGA框架有效捕获医疗图像和文本报告之间的结构语义关系，提供了一种无需负样本的新式对比学习方法，在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 旨在提高医用成像中对低发病率病理病例的检测效率及准确性，同时克服现有生成方法计算昂贵、不可靠及重训练问题。

Method: 基于Stein评分的无重建扩散模型（SBDDM），通过五个扩散步骤捕获轨迹曲率实现异常评分，无需重建步骤，降低计算成本。

Conclusion: SBDDM为实时、可靠的计算机辅助诊断提供了实用性高的基础构造模块，并显著降低推理过程中的计算成本。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: 首先通过一个植物来源识别子系统分类蜂蜜样本的花源，然后通过另一个掺假检测子系统识别掺假并量化其浓度。两步过程分别采用线性判别分析（LDA）提取特征，并用K近邻（KNN）模型进行分类。

Result: 该系统在公开的蜂蜜超光谱数据集上实现了96.39%的交叉验证准确率。

Conclusion: 研究表明该系统是当前化学检测方法的一种有效替代方案，并具有高效性及准确性。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Motivation: 由于缺乏专家标注的数据集和艺术风格元素的复杂性，现有方法在艺术风格分类任务中表现受限。本文旨在改进现有双教师自监督方法的局限性。

Method: 本文引入Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)替代线性投影层和局部聚焦方式，将KAN嵌入双教师知识蒸馏框架中，利用其样条激活函数精准表征非线性特征。

Result: 实验表明，与基础的双教师方法相比，该方法在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上的Top-1准确率表现更优，并显著提升线性探测准确率。

Conclusion: KANs在解耦复杂风格特征方面表现突出，有助于提高艺术风格分类任务在数据稀缺性的条件下的性能。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为RAF的分布式学习方法，以解决基于分辨率漂移导致性能下降的问题，特别是在像人体姿态估计这类非分类任务中。方法通过热力图知识蒸馏实现分辨率适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前联邦学习方法主要集中于分类任务，而对于空间分辨率影响显著的非分类任务，如人体姿态估计，未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应的联邦学习方法RAF，利用热力图为基础的知识蒸馏策略，在高分辨率教师输出与低分辨率学生输出间进行知识蒸馏，提高分辨率鲁棒性。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF方法显著缓解了分辨率漂移问题并提升了性能，同时能够无缝整合到现有FL框架中。

Conclusion: RAF方法在解决分辨率非独立同分布问题中表现出强大的适应性和普适性，尽管本次研究专注于人体姿态估计，其方法具有向其他高分辨率表示任务拓展的潜力。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集缺乏真实场景的复杂性和属性多样性，无法满足实际应用需求，需要更具挑战性和多样化的新数据集。

Method: 构建了CST Anti-UAV数据集，包括220段视频和超过24万个手动注释的边界框，强调了小型无人机目标和复杂场景的多样化，通过分析对比20种SOT方法的表现验证数据集的挑战性。

Result: 实验结果显示，在CST Anti-UAV上，现有最佳方法状态精度仅为35.92%，显著低于在Anti-UAV410数据集上的67.69%，反映了现阶段方法的局限性。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV的发布将推动更强健的单目标跟踪方法的发展，并促进反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

Result: 3D-R1在多项3D场景基准测试中性能平均提升10%。

Conclusion: 3D-R1模型有效增强了3D视觉-语言模型的推理和泛化能力，并为3D场景理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Conclusion: 该方法在保持极少参数量的前提下实现了卓越的高效多任务性能，推进了人工智能在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Motivation: 当前3D数据模拟方法因仅依赖物理先验，难以完全捕捉真实数据的复杂性，因此需要一种基于数据驱动的方法优化3D数据模拟。

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real很好地实现了数据驱动的3D数据模拟方法，为实际应用中的3D视觉任务提供了更高效的数据支持。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Motivation: 解决当前户外种植环境中草莓频繁被遮挡和姿态变化对质量估算准确性的限制。

Method: 使用YOLOv8-Seg进行实例分割，采用CycleGAN完成被遮挡区域填充，并对倾斜角进行修正以提取精准的前投影区域，最后通过多项式回归模型将几何特征映射为质量数据。

Result: 实验中孤立草莓的平均质量估算误差为8.11%，受遮挡情形为10.47%；在遮挡区域恢复中，CycleGAN在像素面积比例和IoU评分上优于LaMa模型。

Conclusion: 提供了一种在复杂遮挡下实现自动化收割和产量监测的鲁棒解决方案，克服了传统方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Conclusion: 超球空间能显著提升多模态图像注册的灵敏性和效能，所提出的方法在性能上取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Conclusion: ART框架通过提升视觉语言模型的适配能力，可以有效提升VRD任务的表现，并展现出在复杂场景分割中的实用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: 通过引入GSFFs的场景表示方法，实现了结合3D几何建模和隐私保护的创新视觉定位方案，表现出卓越的性能。

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在无需人工干预的情境下，实现了高效、稳健的基础设施摄像头标定，有望推动V2X感知系统的发展。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角图像中重建未见外观和几何细节的挑战，同时确保三维一致性和真实感。

Method: 提出一种生成高斯头像的方法，将3D生成模型作为先验，通过模型反演优化来拟合从2D扩散模型生成的合成视图，并施加3D外观和几何约束。

Result: 实验证明，该方法优于目前最先进的技术，并能够很好地泛化到实际场景。

Conclusion: MoGA在保证三维一致性的同时，从单张图像成功重建了高质量的三维头像，并具备可动画性。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Motivation: 传统方法在高精度与实时处理需求之间存在权衡，而此研究目标是解决这一问题。

Method: 通过切割3D体素特征以保留垂直几何信息，并利用方向性注意力机制提取几何特征，实现精度与计算效率的平衡。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上，该方法达到39.3%的mIoU和27.7FPS的推理速度。在边缘设备上推理速度达14.8FPS，验证了其在资源受限环境中实时部署的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证精度和实时性的同时具有显著优势，为自动驾驶提供了有力支持，尤其适用于资源受限的即时部署环境。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法Vcamba，用于视频伪装对象检测（VCOD），通过空间和频率域特征的融合来提高检测性能，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者指出现有VCOD方法依赖空间外观特征感知运动线索，但这些特征因目标与背景的高相似性导致检测精度受限。为克服这些局限性，提出了结合频率与空间特征的新方法。

Method: 提出了Receptive Field Visual State Space（RFVSS）模块提取多尺度空间特征，以及一种新的自适应频率组件增强（AFE）模块进行频率学习。此外设计了基于空间的长范围运动感知（SLMP）模块和基于频率的长范围运动感知（FLMP）模块来分别在空间和频率域中建模时序运动，最终通过空间和频率运动融合模块（SFMF）整合最终特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上的6项评估指标实验中，Vcamba方法优于当前最先进的检测方法，同时具备更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的Vcamba方法通过对视频中目标的空间与频率运动融合，不仅提高了检测的准确性和效率，同时验证了结合频率特征和线性时间建模的优越性。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中PHI数据去识别是共享与隐私保护的核心，需同时保留关键元数据支持AI研究。

Method: 设计基于HIPAA Safe Harbor和DICOM标准的通用规则，使用含合成PHI/PII的多中心医学图像，通过三阶段挑战测试方法性能。

Result: 共有10支团队参与测试阶段，准确率范围为97.91%-99.93%，展现出多种工具和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MIDI-B提供了一个标准化、有效的医学影像去识别评估平台，具有参考价值。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that incorporating a consistency heuristic into the
point-matching algorithm \cite{yerebakan2023hierarchical} improves robustness
in matching anatomical locations across pairs of medical images. We validated
our approach on diverse longitudinal internal and public datasets spanning CT
and MRI modalities. Notably, it surpasses state-of-the-art results on the Deep
Lesion Tracking dataset. Additionally, we show that the method effectively
addresses landmark localization. The algorithm operates efficiently on standard
CPU hardware and allows configurable trade-offs between speed and robustness.

TL;DR: DivControl结合分解预训练和知识导向技术，实现了统一的可控生成和高效适配，有效提升了生成质量和适配成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在适配新控制条件时存在泛化性差和高成本的问题，亟需一种高效且统一的可控生成方法。

Method: 提出DivControl框架，通过SVD分解和知识分流技术，将模型因子化为条件无关的学习基因和条件特定的调节，结合动态门控机制增强模型适配能力，并引入表示对齐损失提升模态一致性。

Result: DivControl在提升生成质量的同时，训练成本降低36.4倍，在新条件下具备强大的零样本和小样本泛化性能。

Conclusion: DivControl具有优越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，为统一的可控生成研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Motivation: 现有的FS-CS方法在分类和分割上虽达到较高精度，但在对小目标的处理上表现不佳。

Method: 引入了EMAT模型，包括三个改进：记忆高效的masked注意力机制、可学习的降采样策略及参数高效优化。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$上表现优于所有现有方法，同时使用的可训练参数至少减少了四倍。

Conclusion: EMAT在不增加参数代价的情况下，显著提升了分类和分割精度，并引入了更贴近实际应用的评价设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了传统方法效率低、资源成本高的问题，同时展示了在多个数据集上优异的性能和资源优化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Conclusion: 显式条件化时间元数据是解决时间动态变化问题的有效方法，并验证了OmniTraj模型的优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical

hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral

independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐式扩散模型的统一图像修复框架，通过引入低质量视觉先验和特殊模块设置，解决多类型图像退化问题，并在多任务设置下实现了SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一图像修复（AiOIR）需要处理多样化的图像退化问题，而传统方法难以同时兼顾多任务的性能和细节恢复。

Method: 提出一种基于隐式扩散模型的框架，将低质量视觉先验纳入扩散过程，设计了退化感知特征融合（DAFF）模块和细节感知专家模块（DAEM），分别用于处理多样退化和增强纹理细节。

Result: 通过实验验证，在多任务和混合退化情况下，该框架实现了领先的性能水平，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 隐式扩散模型的生成能力在统一图像修复任务中展现出巨大潜力，为实际应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FlowGaussian-VR模型解决3D视频重建在复杂运动情况下的视觉质量问题，表现出显著的视觉改善和更清晰的动态纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高保真视频重建存在对复杂运动场景和大尺度差异的适应性不足问题，具体表现为变形网络对高斯轨迹的过拟合以及动态内容的表达不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于流的速度场建模方案，FlowGaussian-VR，包括速度场渲染管道（VFR）实现基于光流的优化，以及流辅助的自适应加密方式（FAD）调整动态区域高斯数量与大小。

Result: FlowGaussian-VR 在多视角动态重建和新视角合成上表现优异，在处理复杂运动场景时，PSNR获得了超过2.5 dB的提升，并大大减轻了动态纹理中的模糊现象。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR 显著提升了动态场景的视觉质量，提供更规则且可追踪的单个高斯轨迹，可用于虚拟和增强现实的动态场景显示。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 数据驱动的正则化方法优于基于假设的公理方法，为非刚性形状匹配提供了一种新的实现路径。

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 新数据集与框架显著提高了抓取任务的效果，为进一步研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用槽注意机制的对象中心学习方法存在槽冗余及监督信号单一的问题，影响了任务表现。

Method: 1）引入重新初始化的槽聚合机制以减少槽冗余；2）通过自我蒸馏，驱动不良初始注意图逼近优良终态注意图。

Result: DIAS在对象发现、识别等OCL任务中达到了最先进的性能表现，同时提升了视觉预测与推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS有效解决了槽注意机制中的冗余和监督问题，并在多个视觉任务中展现了其先进性。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Result: 实现无穿透、物理合理且实时运行的3D人类动作与环境交互，支持任意身体形态与动作。

Conclusion: 该方法无需复杂训练，保留原始动作细节并突破运动学模型与环境交互的局限性。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种从稀疏视角视频中高效重建动态场景的可行方案，显著降低了设备成本并提升了实用性。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Conclusion: 论文展示了高效的视频到动态3D内容生成方法，大幅提升生成质量和应用适应性，为基于视频生成高质量动画内容提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

Result: Mixtral 8x7B 在完整性(99.6%)、精确度(98.8%)和幻觉率(1.2%)方面优于 Mistral 7B（分别为93%、96%和4%），但代价为更高的资源需求。

Conclusion: Mixtral 8x7B 展现了更出色的数据生成能力，但需权衡其显著高计算成本。这为生产环境中部署大语言模型提供了宝贵实践指导。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

Result: 实验显示，微调后的LLama3-8B模型在专业性和用户友好性上优于GPT-4o，证明小型模型通过增强和优化可有效胜任领域特定任务。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为电力营销服务场景设计的LLM开发提供了系统性框架和评估基准，填补了领域针对性研究的关键空白。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

*Jinyu Liu,Xiaoying Song,Diana Zhang,Jason Thomale,Daqing He,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过嵌入式机器学习（ML）模型与大型语言模型（LLMs）相结合的混合框架，以改进书籍主题术语的预测，对现有系统中的误生成和偏差问题进行了缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图书管理系统在主题分析中使用的多标签分类存在无法处理未知情况的问题，而LLMs尽管表现优越，但存在过度生成和虚假生成的不足。

Method: 提出混合框架，利用ML模型预测最优主题标签数量以引导LLMs生成，并通过实际LCSH术语对生成结果进行后期编辑，以减少遗漏和虚假预测。

Result: 实验表明，通过引导LLMs生成初步预测并施加后期编辑，可显著提高预测结果的准确性和对词汇的对齐度。

Conclusion: 这种混合框架能够缓解LLMs在主题分析中出现的过度生成和虚假生成问题，为图书管理系统的主题术语预测提供了一个更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的知识图谱（KG）整合方法，通过标签匹配和三元组匹配来处理多样化与复杂背景下的KG整合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管目前的本体与实体匹配研究已经深入，但对上下文匹配的研究仍不足，而真实世界的KG在数据来源、大小及信息密度上差异很大。现有方法在应对多样化与复杂上下文的场景中可能不足。

Method: 提出了一种包含标签匹配与三元组匹配的KG整合方法，具体应用了字符串处理、模糊匹配及向量相似性等技术。此外，还引入新的数据集对三元组匹配步骤进行全面评测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在OAEI竞赛和多样化测试案例中表现出与主流系统及监督学习方法相当的高准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效改善了KG在复杂背景下的整合性能，同时验证了三元组匹配的可行性与改进优势。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Result: 指出了幻觉风险的界限，汇总了多种检测和减缓幻觉的方法，并推荐了相应评估协议与实验设置。

Conclusion: 论文为理解和解决LLMs中的幻觉现象提供了理论框架和实用方法，具有实际指导价值。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统RAG在处理需要跟踪实体和现象跨时间发展的查询时存在不足，缺乏考虑时间逻辑的检索能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的RAG框架，包括：1. 拆解用户的查询为主题和时间窗口；2. 设计特定的检索器，结合语义匹配和时间相关性，收集时间上连续的证据。

Result: 通过在金融新闻混合语料上的ADQAB基准测试，提出的方法相较传统RAG实现了13%-27%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了时间逻辑注入的可行性，为解决复杂的现实问题提供了更加精细的RAG路径，同时公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

Motivation: 探讨不同规模的语言模型是否会生成相似的可解释特征，从而验证特征普适性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)对模型激活进行特征提取、对齐，比对了不同层次特征空间的相似性。

Result: 中间层具有最强的特征重合度，早期和后期层次相似性较低；初步实验还发现语义相似的多子空间与模型的交互方式类似。

Conclusion: 较大规模的语言模型在概念分割方面展现出普适性，这对跨模型的可解释性研究至关重要。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究开发预测临床试验中严重不良事件（SAE）结果的模型，重点是通过实验组和对照组的SAE比例进行分类和回归，使用的模型结合了预训练语言模型和滑动窗口法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高临床试验设计效率，避免试验终止并减少参与者暴露于不必要风险的可能性。

Method: 利用ClinicalTrials.gov中22,107项临床试验数据，开发了两个预测模型：一是分类模型，用于预测实验组SAE比例是否高于对照组；二是回归模型，用于预测对照组SAE比例。采用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）和滑动窗口嵌入提取的方法进行特征提取。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在分类任务中的AUC为77.6%，在回归任务中RMSE为18.6%。使用滑动窗口方法的模型表现优于不使用滑动窗口的方法。

Conclusion: 预估试验结果的能力可优化试验设计，并发现与报告的安全性结果之间的偏差，从而更好地利用ClinicalTrials.gov的数据。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

Conclusion: 本文搭建了传统矢量量化和现代 LLM 应用的桥梁，为开发高效的通用多模态系统提供了基石性参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

Motivation: 针对语言模型成本高、易生成虚假信息等问题，提出解决方案以减少资源浪费并提升信息提取的正确性。

Method: 设计并应用了一种语言模型链（LMC）算法，通过层级化的模型组合，筛选出可能正确的响应，并对错误预测进一步使用更高效的语言模型进行验证，直到所有预测都为正确。

Result: 通过在医疗文件中提取患者出生日期的实验验证，LMC算法显著提高了预测速度和准确性，减少了虚假信息生成。

Conclusion: LMC算法对知识提取领域有重要贡献，并值得进一步研究和探索。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

Motivation: 2021年GameStop短线挤压事件显示出散户投资者在社交媒体上的活跃度，引起了对在线情绪是否影响股票价格的关注。

Method: 分析Reddit r/wallstreetbets中针对GameStop和AMC的讨论，采用两种现有情绪分析方法，并使用一个改进的基于ChatGPT注释和RoBERTa模型的方法，同时使用相关性和因果性指标评估预测能力。

Result: 研究发现社交媒体情绪与个股价格的相关性较弱，而评论量和搜索趋势等简易指标预测效果更强。

Conclusion: 零售投资者行为的复杂性使传统情绪分析难以完全捕捉网络讨论中对市场的影响。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Result: 实验结果显示，优化后的提示策略能够显著提升跨语言知识共享和下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 建议更广泛地利用多语言资源共享，并优化跨语言提示策略，尤其是针对非英语和低资源语言的应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程中的同伴反馈能提高学生参与度与教学效果，但语言背景可能影响学生的反馈体验，特别是在国际学生占多的情况下。

Method: 采用Twitter-roBERTa模型分析500名学生的反馈情感，与其语言背景关联，并控制性别和年龄等变量。

Result: 母语英语学生对反馈评价较低，非母语学生则写出更积极的反馈，但收到的反馈情感较少正向，语言背景对反馈体验起到复杂作用。

Conclusion: 语言背景在在线课程同伴反馈中起到了复杂且重要的作用，教学设计需要更细致地考虑这些差异。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Conclusion: H-MEM架构有效提升了LLM Agents在长期对话场景中的决策能力和语境一致性，在记忆组织和检索效率上有显著优势。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

Method: 提出了一种基于全局关系和跨句推理的新型输入编码方法，将实体表示为独立段，而非依赖具体位置。

Result: 实验在DocRED, Re-DocRED和REBEL数据集上验证了该方法的有效性，其结果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 理论上推动了文档级关系抽取中的全局语境建模和跨句推理；实践上改善了关系检测的性能，可用于需要全面实体级洞察和可解释性的NLP应用中。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

TL;DR: 引入Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark，用于细粒度评估检索增强生成（RAG）系统中语言模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试仅关注RAG系统的整体性能，而忽略了对语言模型能力的单独评估，尤其是在文档利用上的细化评估。

Method: 设计了一个名为Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark的多层次基准测试，评估模型在多层次过滤、内容结合和引用推理中的表现，并通过占位符方法分离模型原生知识与外部知识的贡献。

Result: 实验表明代表性语言模型在RAG系统生成能力上存在局限性，尤其在错误弹性和上下文忠实性方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试提供了一个可复现的框架，有助于推动更可靠高效的RAG系统的发展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过因果方法探讨Chain-of-thought (CoT) 提示在大语言模型中的忠实性，分析其对内部推理过程的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨CoT的生成"推理过程"是否真实反映内部推理机理，以及其是否能提升大语言模型对复杂任务的内部结构解释性。

Method: 通过结合稀疏自编码器与激活替换技术，提取模型在不同提示方式下的特征，并检测这些特征对模型输出的因果作用；同时使用不同规模的模型（Pythia-70M与Pythia-2.8B）探索模型规模的影响。

Result: 在较大模型（Pythia-2.8B）中，通过CoT提升的特定推理特征成功提高了无CoT运行的答案对数概率，且模型内部呈现更高的激活稀疏性和特征可解释性；但在较小模型（Pythia-70M）中效果不显著。

Conclusion: CoT能在高容量大语言模型中引发更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为一种结构化提示方法的价值。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

TL;DR: 提出EH-Benchmark，一个评估医学大语言模型（MLLMs）幻觉的新基准，并通过三阶段框架显著降低幻觉，提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在知识不足、视觉定位能力弱、多模态数据稀缺等问题，导致幻觉现象并限制了其精度。

Method: 提出一种三阶段框架，包括知识检索、任务案例分析和结果验证，以减少幻觉，用EH-Benchmark评估。

Result: 多代理框架显著减少视觉理解与逻辑组成类幻觉，提高模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark有效审视与缓解MLLMs在眼科领域的幻觉现象，为精确诊断提供了新路径。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个新的方法，用于生成可以安全共享的合成PII披露数据集，以促进对在线社交媒体隐私风险的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏公开的标注数据集阻碍了对PII披露文本检测的研究。

Method: 通过3个大型语言模型生成与原Reddit内容相似的PII合成数据集，构建了一个19种PII披露类别的分类法，并通过多重指标验证其实用性。

Result: 数据集通过了可重现性等效性、与原用户的无法链接性、以及与原始数据的可区分性测试。

Conclusion: 发布了一个可靠的合成PII数据集及代码，旨在推进线上隐私风险分析领域的研究可复现性。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG通过动态压缩上下文以优化推理效率，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法因检索上下文长度导致推理成本高，而固定压缩率的上下文压缩未能有效解决复杂性问题。

Method: 提出ACC-RAG框架，结合分层压缩器与上下文选择器，根据输入复杂度动态调整压缩率，模仿人类快速浏览。

Result: ACC-RAG在Wikipedia及五个问答数据集上的表现优于固定压缩率方法，并在保持或提高准确性的同时，推理速度提高4倍以上。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在提升推理效率的同时，保证了RAG的准确性，是一种有效的上下文压缩与选择策略。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Motivation: 当前AIOps单一模型受特定领域知识限制，难以满足多任务要求，而多模型协作可以显著提升效率，但AIOps领域的相关研究较少。

Method: 设计了一个融入通用大语言模型任务分类器的协作专家框架 (CoE-Ops)，并引入检索增强生成机制以处理不同层次的AIOps任务。

Result: 基于DevOps-EVAL数据集，CoE-Ops在高层AIOps任务的路由准确率上提升72%，在问题解决上比单一模型提高8%，较更大规模的混合专家模型提高14%。

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架通过大语言模型与检索增强生成机制的结合，在准确率与效率提升方面明显优于现有方法，并证明了其在AIOps领域中的应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Result: 数据集包含来自21个国家76名作者的2658份放射学报告，涵盖13种语言、多种成像模式与解剖区域。参与者在人类与AI区分实验中的平均辨别准确率为53.9%，放射科医师表现更佳。

Conclusion: PARROT是迄今为止最大的开放性多语言放射学报告数据集，对于开发和验证跨语言、地域及临床限制的自然语言处理应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,
geographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints.

### [126] [Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22940)
*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE框架提升了大型语言模型推理过程中的事实准确性和可信度，显著改善高风险领域的应用安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理过程中存在的事实不准确性问题，特别是在高风险领域，如医疗、法律和科学研究。

Method: 提出了三部分组成的框架：1) 基于反事实数据训练的事实核查分类器；2) 平衡多维度奖励的群体相对策略优化；3) 通过机制解释模块分析模型激活如何提升事实性。

Result: 框架显著提升了事实准确性（最高提升49.90%），保持或提高了在Math-500、AIME-2024和GPQA等基准上的性能，同时发现了改善事实性的激活模式变化。

Conclusion: RELIANCE框架不仅增强了模型在推理过程中的事实稳健性，还为未来基于激活指导的优化方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SigBERT的新框架，用于将电子健康病例（EHR）的时间序列文本信息转化为特征，并实现更精确的生存分析预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生存分析方法在处理电子健康病例中的复杂文本数据及其时间序列特性时存在困难，因此需要一个能够更有效处理和利用这些数据的模型。

Method: 提出SigBERT框架，首先通过BERT模型提取和平均单词嵌入生成句子嵌入，然后应用粗糙路径理论从时间序列的句子嵌入中提取特征，最后结合LASSO-惩罚的Cox模型进行生存风险预测。

Result: 在一个真实世界的肿瘤学数据集上，SigBERT的独立测试集C指数得分为0.75（标准差0.014），显示了其在整合时序医疗数据和风险评估上的优势。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过将时序文本数据转化为有效特征，显著提升了生存分析模型的性能，推动了基于叙事的生存分析技术的发展。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合NLP技术和多波次自适应抽样的新方法，用于快速验证基于代码的健康结果算法测量特性，从而减少时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模数据分析变得普遍，需要一个高效的方法来验证基于代码的算法，以评估因错误分类带来的潜在偏倚。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的验证流程，将自然语言处理（NLP）技术与多波次自适应抽样方法结合，通过减少人工审查时间和实施预定义的停止规则提高效率。

Result: 通过实证研究发现，NLP技术减小了每个案例审查用时40%，多波次抽样减少了77%的案例审查量，并且并未显著影响精度。

Conclusion: 这一方法能更常规地验证基于代码的算法定义的研究参数，从而提高数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

### [129] [Opacity as Authority: Arbitrariness and the Preclusion of Contestation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22944)
*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新定义了任意性，将其视为结构化人类系统和交互的基础性机能，而非规范性缺陷或支配的象征。提出了一种统合性的框架，分析任意性在法律、社会动态及人工智能可解释性中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在颠覆传统将任意性等同于不公的观点，通过跨领域分析展示其在语言、法律及社会系统中的功能性及必要性。

Method: 基于索绪尔的符号任意性理论，结合香农熵模型，引入“动机-可验证性-可争议性”链条，并分析其断裂后的规范性及控制性影响。

Result: 提出了一种基于条件熵A = H(L|M)的现代任意性理论，揭示其作为控制与关怀中性操作符的角色，同时探索其在AI系统可解释性问题中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 任意性不仅是社会系统的基础性操作机制，还为AI系统的可解释性分析提供了新视角，是理解权威与责任规避的重要工具。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文关注语音对话模型(SDMs)在处理人类语音交互挑战方面的研究不足，提出包含英、中双语数据集和基于LLM的评估方法，以全面评估SDM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音对话模型(SDMs)广受关注，但研究集中于其理解并模拟人类对话的实际能力上仍存空白，尤其是相比文本文本大语言模型（LLM）存在性能基准测试的缺乏。

Method: 本文提出一个含1079例的英、中双语基准数据集，并配以基于LLM的评估方法，该方法与人类评估标准高度一致，用以探索语音对话模型的能力。

Result: 通过该数据集和评估方法，研究揭示SDMs在应对多层次语音交互复杂性中的表现。

Conclusion: 提出的新数据集及评估方法弥补了语音对话模型研究的空白，通过基准化促进了对模型性能的全面理解。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了现代大语言模型（LLMs）在数学自然语言推理（Math NLI）任务中的表现，构建了一个数学NLI语料库并分析了其质量和模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代LLMs能否在数学文本中执行NLI任务，以探索其在理解数学语言和推理方面的潜力。

Method: 构建了一个由数学文本中的前提和由专家提供的假设与金标准标签组成的Math NLI语料库，并分析了不同LLMs在该语料库上的表现和一致性。

Result: 在某些设置下，LLMs的多数投票结果与人类标注数据的效果相当，但其仍在数学语言理解和基本推理上有不足，且模型对假设单独推理的倾向有所减少。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学自然语言推理任务中具有潜力，但当前技术还不足以全面胜任该领域的需求，需通过改进模型和数据集继续推进。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用大语言模型（LLMs）通过上下文学习（ICL）执行框架语义解析（FSP）的方法，而无需模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用现有的大语言模型及上下文学习方法，在不进行模型微调的情况下完成领域特定的框架语义解析任务。

Method: 提出了一种无需微调的方法，通过FrameNet数据库自动生成特定任务的提示，用于框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL），并在与暴力事件相关的框架上测试。

Result: 在框架识别和语义角色标注任务上，分别取得了F1分数94.3%和77.4%的结果。

Conclusion: 上下文学习是一种执行领域特定框架语义解析任务的有效且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了CARoPE（Context-Aware Rotary Positional Embedding），一种动态生成基于令牌嵌入的上下文感知旋转位置嵌入的方法，提升了性能并保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RoPE方法虽然高效但使用静态频率模式，无法建模上下文敏感关系，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种动态生成基于令牌嵌入的头部相关频率模式的机制，通过一个受限的嵌入变换计算相位偏移，并将其集成到旋转机制中。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE具有更低的困惑度，在更长上下文长度下也表现较好，还提升了训练吞吐量且未影响模型稳定性。

Conclusion: CARoPE提供了一种可扩展、表达力强且高效的Transformer模型位置编码策略改进方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

TL;DR: SMART-Editor是一种可适用于多领域布局和内容编辑的框架，提出了两种方法以确保全局一致性，并在实验中显示出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在编辑时通常只关注局部修改，缺少对整体一致性的处理，因此需要一种保证全局语义和视觉一致的编辑框架。

Method: 提出了两种方法——Reward-Refine（推理时的基于奖励的优化方法）和RewardDPO（训练时的偏好优化方法），并引入了SMARTEdit-Bench基准来评估模型性能。

Result: 在新的基准上，SMART-Editor优于主流模型，在结构化设置上RewardDPO带来高达15%的提升，而Reward-Refine对自然图像具有优势。

Conclusion: 通过智能奖励引导的编辑，可以有效提高语义一致性和视觉对齐性，验证了本方法的价值。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的数据库自然语言接口在企业级数据目录中缺乏可扩展性的问题，同时避免了复杂的领域特定微调过程，并利用元数据中的语义上下文。

Method: 通过组件化检索架构将数据库的模式和元数据分解为独立的语义单元，并分别对其进行索引，以实现针对性的检索；在保证有效表识别的同时，利用列级信息控制检索表的总数以保持在合理范围内。

Result: 在大规模、结构多样的数据库（具有不同元数据）上，这种方法在召回率和准确性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在无需复杂微调的情况下，实现了可在不同企业场景中部署的高效文本到SQL系统，解决了自然语言数据库接口的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在面对语义模糊文本时的表现及其信任性问题，强调其在实际应用中的潜在风险，旨在改善语言不确定性处理方法。

Method: 构建并生成包含背景信息的模糊句子及其对应的消歧对，通过分类和实验检验LLMs在识别和理解模糊语句上的表现缺陷。

Result: 实验发现，LLMs难以区分模糊和非模糊文本，对模糊文本表现出过度自信，且易于过度思考潜在含义，与人类行为差异显著。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理语言模糊上的局限性暴露了其在实际应用中的不可靠性，需开发改进方法来应对语言理解中的不确定性。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

Motivation: 解决多模态模型在真实环境中辨别不同模态因果关系的核心问题。

Method: 给定任务步骤图片和计划文字片段，判断视觉步骤在文本步骤之前或之后的发生次序，并在十种前沿视觉-语言模型上进行评估。

Result: 所评估模型的性能较差，最佳零样本F1为0.57，链式推理提升至0.62，均远低于人类表现（0.98 F1）。

Conclusion: 模型需在因果理解提升方向上进一步改进，以缩小与人类表现的差距。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索从用户与语言模型的交互日志中提取隐性用户反馈用于模型改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型长期部署后需根据用户反馈不断进化，但直接询问反馈可能打扰用户，因此探索从交互中获取隐性反馈。

Method: 分析用户与语言模型的对话轨迹，提取隐性反馈，并测试此反馈对模型性能改进的影响。

Result: 发现用户反馈的内容比情绪倾向对模型改进更有帮助，但对于更复杂的问题效果有限，并且反馈效果与用户最初输入质量密切相关。

Conclusion: 隐性用户反馈有潜力改进语言模型，但其效果存在局限性，需与用户输入质量匹配。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了GEAK框架，利用LLM生成针对AMD GPUs（如MI300X）的高效Triton GPU内核代码，并显著提高了内核代码生成的正确性和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增长，以及对硬件优化解决方案需求的增加，低级内核开发自动化变得至关重要。

Method: GEAK利用先进的LLM技术，通过反思式反馈机制生成高性能的Triton代码，并在两个基准测试中进行评估对比。

Result: 与基线方法相比，GEAK在代码正确性上提高到63%，在执行速度上获得最高达2.59倍的提升。

Conclusion: GEAK框架展示了通过智能代码生成加速硬件平台多样化采纳的潜力，同时促进了专业级内核性能的普及。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种方法利用负样本改进正样本选择，从而提升大语言模型少样本环境学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的少样本学习对提供的示例高度敏感，而手动选择示例存在固有偏差，文章旨在通过引入负样本减少这一问题。

Method: 以Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本语料库，利用语义相似性选择与查询最匹配的正负样本，再基于与负样本的语义相似性进一步检索正样本，最终结合两部分正样本生成学习演示。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于仅依靠正样本的方法，证实负样本中信息有助于改进正样本选择。

Conclusion: 引入负样本选择机制能显著优化少样本学习过程，提供了一种更高效的正负样本联合优化策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的主题模型方法MTMs，用于克服传统基于词袋模型在语义抽象特征表达上的局限性，并通过稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)学习出可解释特征，从而挖掘深层次的概念主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型由于基于词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征。即便是某些神经网络变种，由于将主题表达为单纯单词列表，仍然限制了复杂主题的表达。这些局限性催生了新的方法需求。

Method: 本文提出机制主题模型(MTMs)，利用稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)学习可解释特征，从而在更丰富的语义空间中定义主题；此外，提出了用于评估主题模型的LLM辅助方法“topic judge”。

Result: 实验结果表明，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统及神经基线模型相当或更佳，且在主题判别中表现优越。同时，MTMs支持基于主题向量的生成控制。

Conclusion: MTMs有效克服传统方法的语义表达局限，并提供了更好的主题生成与评价方式，具有显著意义。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默症的早期诊断需要分析复杂的多模态生物标记物，而现有工具在处理结构化和小样本数据方面存在挑战。

Method: 将TableGPT2适配为TAP-GPT，通过少样本提示学习和qLoRA微调的方法完成阿尔茨海默症和认知正常的二分类任务。

Result: TAP-GPT在处理结构化生物医学数据时表现优越，超越了通用LLMs和其他针对预测任务的表格模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个将LLMs应用于基于表格生物标记数据预测任务的研究，为未来LLM驱动的多代理框架在生物医学信息学中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Result: 实验结果表明，Mistral和Qwen在心理健康领域展现了较强的推理能力；同时，Claude-3.5-haiku在应对心理健康污名化方面表现最为负责。

Conclusion: 这些研究结果为LLMs在心理健康领域的应用，特别是推理和污名化问题的解决，提供了重要的见解，并为未来改进模型设计提供了参考方向。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Method: 通过翻译的数据集测试10个开源大语言模型，并进行深入错误分析，同时比较不同模型的表现。

Result: 小型模型和部分模型（如Mistral）在孟加拉语中的表现较差；但某些架构（如DeepSeek）在跨语言间保持更稳定的表现。还发现了令模型表现下降的标记化效率问题，并强调改善数据质量和评估方法的重要性。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

Motivation: 探索稀疏激活的专家混合(MoE)大语言模型中，各专家的重要性差异，尤其是识别和分析其中关键专家(SEs)对模型性能和机制发挥的核心作用。

Method: 采用稀疏激活观察和特性分析的方法，从专家激活异常识别、剪枝测试及在不同任务场景中评估SEs的重要性，研究其对注意力分配机制的干扰效应。

Result: 确定了SEs的存在及其在推理中的核心作用：SEs的稀有强激活特性对跨解码层状态有极大影响，其分布不受训练后操作改变；剪枝会显著损害模型性能，如影响数学推理能力甚至导致输出信息重复。

Conclusion: 论文首次系统揭示了MoE模型中的SEs对模型性能的重要性，并通过分析确定它们对注意力分布和模型核心能力的机制作用，为MoE模型优化与压缩研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Method: 通过实验证明GPT-4o-mini在改写敏感内容时的隐性审查行为，同时评估其在零样本场景下对句子敏感性分类的能力，并与传统方法进行比较。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o-mini系统性地将内容改写为较低敏感等级，显著减少了侮辱性和禁忌性语言。

Conclusion: GPT-4o-mini在处理敏感内容时展现了隐性内容审查的倾向，并且在敏感性分类任务中表现出一定的零样本能力。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在训练数据中涉及的音乐相关知识较少，限制了其在音乐应用领域的表现，因此需要提高其在音乐问答任务上的适应能力。

Method: 通过引入MusWikiDB（一个音乐专业化的向量数据库）作为检索阶段的辅助，并在推理和微调过程中融合上下文信息，从而利用Retrieval Augmented Generation（RAG）技术改进通用LLMs。

Result: MusT-RAG在音乐领域的LLMs适应能力上显著优于传统微调方法，在内外领域基准上的音乐问答任务均表现出一致的改进。MusWikiDB相比通用的Wikipedia语料库表现更优，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG框架能有效将通用LLMs适配为音乐领域专项模型，显著提升了音乐问答任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Result: 实验表明TeQoDO优于迁移学习方法，并在下游对话状态跟踪任务中表现出色，同时展示其可扩展性。

Conclusion: TeQoDO为LLM改进解释性和可控性提供了一种新方法，标志着本体更广泛应用的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

Motivation: 当前的基准无法直接评估多模态的实际规划能力，并且缺乏跨模态约束条件的系统性评估。为此提出MPCC基准，以填补这一研究空缺。

Method: MPCC包含三个现实任务（航班规划、日历规划、会议规划）并引入复杂约束，如预算、时间和空间等，设计了不同难度等级以区分约束复杂性和搜索空间扩展的影响。通过13个先进MLLMs模型进行实验分析并比较其性能。

Result: 闭源模型的规划可行率仅达21.3%，开源模型平均低于11%。发现MLLMs高度敏感于约束复杂性，传统的多模态提示策略在多约束场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: MPCC方法系统化了多模态约束评估，提供了严格的评估框架，并揭示了当前MLLMs在处理约束感知推理方面的瓶颈，为未来模型性能改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法为了改进解码器模型的嵌入任务通常需要修改模型架构或增加计算成本。

Method: 通过轻量化BERT模型生成上下文标记预编码文本，并结合解码器模型输入，最终结合上下文标记和末端标记的隐藏态生成文本嵌入。

Result: Causal2Vec在MTEB数据集中的性能达到最优，且相比其他方法减少序列长度达85%，推理时间降低至82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec无需改变解码器原本架构即可提升模型嵌入能力，同时显著减少计算成本，具有广泛的实用性。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of

*Yongbing Zhang,Fang Nan,Shengxiang Gao,Yuxin Huang,Kaiwen Tan,Zhengtao Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MRGSEM-Sum 是一种基于多关系图和结构熵最小化的多文档摘要框架，有效缓解了复杂文档关系和信息冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多文档摘要方法受限于单一关系建模和预定义聚类数，难以充分捕捉复杂信息关系并适应性降低冗余。

Method: 提出基于多关系图的综合模型和二维结构熵最小化算法，解决文档间动态关系建模与自动化聚类问题，并加入位置感知压缩机制生成简洁摘要。

Result: 在Multi-News、DUC-2004、PubMed和WikiSum四大数据集上显著优于传统无监督方法，在某些场景下可媲美有监督模型和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum 在一致性和覆盖性方面接近人类水平，为多文档摘要提供了新颖且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对阿拉伯语的增强版密集段落检索（DPR）框架，利用一种新的注意力相关性评分（ARS）机制，提高了阿拉伯语问答场景下的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语由于其复杂的形态结构、可选的变音符号以及现代标准阿拉伯语与方言共存，给自然语言处理和信息检索带来了挑战，而现有的研究和基准资源尚未充分代表阿拉伯语。

Method: 提出了一种新的注意力相关性评分（ARS）机制，替代了传统的交互机制，并结合预训练的阿拉伯语语言模型与框架结构的改进，用于优化检索性能。

Result: 新方法显著提升了阿拉伯语问题的检索和排序精度。

Conclusion: 此次改进不仅优化了阿拉伯语的问答检索性能，同时填补了阿拉伯语NLP研究中的空白，研究代码已公开发布。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为主动批判性思考的新范式，通过模型主动向用户寻求澄清或缺失信息以更好地解决问题，并提出GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个基准来测试数学推理能力。实验表明现有模型在此方面表现不佳，但通过强化学习算法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善AI模型在处理不完整或误导性信息时的表现，避免模型被有偏差的数据或推理误导。

Method: 引入主动批判性思考的范式，设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE基准测试，并通过强化学习算法优化模型性能。

Result: 通过强化学习方法，将Qwen3-1.7B在GSM-MC上的准确率从0.15%提高到73.98%。

Conclusion: 主动批判性思考可以帮助模型更有效地与用户协作，解决复杂问题，为提高AI系统的鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过微调大语言模型（LLM）以根据用户角色生成不同响应的有效性，提出三种建模策略并构建了两个数据集以评估方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业环境中的应用增加，基于用户角色控制模型行为已经成为一个关键需求。然而，现有安全方法并未考虑角色特定的访问限制。因此，本研究旨在探讨如何通过微调LLMs来反映不同组织角色的访问权限。

Method: 提出三种建模策略：基于BERT的分类器、基于LLM的分类器及基于角色条件生成的方法。同时构建了两个数据集，一个通过现有的指令调优语料库改造而来，另一个为合成生成以反映现实中的角色敏感场景。

Result: 研究评估了这些方法在不同组织结构下的性能，并分析了模型对提示注入、角色不匹配和越权尝试的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，模型微调可以有效地实现基于角色的访问控制，同时揭示了不同行为策略的优缺点。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在临床决策支持中的安全性和有效性难以评估的问题，提供一个标准化、权威的评价基准框架。

Method: 基于临床专家共识开发CSEDB评估框架，涵盖30项关键标准，并构建2,069个开放性问题，测试了六个大语言模型的表现，评估其在不同场景下的安全性与有效性。

Result: 所测试模型的总体表现为57.2%的平均总分，其中安全性得分54.7%，有效性得分62.3%。高风险场景表现下降13.3%，医学领域专用模型的评分优于通用模型。

Conclusion: 研究提供了标准化的评估方法，有助于发现风险并指引模型改进方向，同时推进大语言模型在医疗场景中的安全与有效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种医疗领域中的检索增强推理框架Med-R$^3$，通过渐进式强化学习实现检索与推理的联合优化，实验结果表明该框架在若干模型上均取得了性能突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注模型在检索或推理单一方面的提升，而忽视了两者之间的联合优化。此外，目前方法依赖于监督微调，可能限制模型在新问题情境下的泛化能力。同时，现有基于强化学习的检索增强推理在奖励函数设计上未充分满足医疗领域的特定需求。

Method: 本文提出了框架Med-R$^3$，分为三个阶段：1）培养模型在医疗问题上的逻辑推理能力；2）自适应优化检索能力以更好利用知识库；3）联合优化模型的检索与推理协调性。

Result: 实验表明，采用Med-R$^3$的LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct模型性能超越了规模相近的GPT-4o-mini，提升3.93%。同时，增强后的Qwen2.5-14B模型性能提升了13.53%。

Conclusion: Med-R$^3$通过联合优化检索和推理，推动了医疗检索增强推理的性能发展，并在多个模型上取得了显著的提升。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

Motivation: 应对机器生成文本的广泛应用及对抗性修改带来的检测挑战，提高检测方法的抗干扰能力。

Method: 引入T-Detect方法，将传统的高斯归一化替换为基于Student's t分布的重尾偏差分数，用于计算检测得分，并使用两个数据集RAID和HART进行了验证。

Result: 在对抗性文本检测中表现优异，相较于强基线性能提升，AUROC在特定领域提升达3.9%，并在RAID数据集的Books领域取得0.926的AUROC（SOTA）。

Conclusion: 提出一种理论支持强、鲁棒性强的新方法，推动了文本生成检测的发展，并提供了代码支持后续研究。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Motivation: 近期提出的差分Transformer通过抑制噪声改善了模型表现，作者希望对其进行参数高效的改进以适配更多任务。

Method: 提出了一种名为DiffLoRA的方法，结合了差分注意力机制和低秩适配器应用于正负注意项，旨在保持效率同时提升性能。

Result: 在大多数NLP任务中，DiffLoRA的效果稍逊于现有的参数高效微调方法，但在某些领域表现突出，如HumanEval任务上提升了11分。

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在某些特定任务中显示了优越性，但整体效果不如其他微调方法，适合在特定领域进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Motivation: 近年来社交媒体中的仇恨言论问题日益严重，因此需要有效的方法来检测和清理阿拉伯语仇恨言论。

Method: 使用深度学习模型和Transformer进行实验，确定最佳模型；将文本清理作为机器翻译任务处理，用星号替换不适当词汇。

Result: 仇恨言论检测模型取得了92%的Macro F1分数和95%的准确率；文本清理任务中，仇恨言论掩码模型达到了0.3的BLEU分数，在机器翻译系统中表现较好。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了用于阿拉伯语仇恨言论检测和清理的有效方法，对社交媒体内容管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑规则可以提高知识图谱的完整性，检测潜在错误，揭示数据模式并增强推理能力；然而，这些规则的复杂性和标签规范使其难以理解。

Method: 使用AMIE 3.5.1算法提取逻辑规则，并对三种数据集进行研究，结合多种提示策略，同时进行人工评估和自动判别研究。

Result: 论文结果表明，在解释正确性和清晰度方面表现良好，但未来仍有许多挑战待解决。

Conclusion: 研究验证了大语言模型在逻辑规则解释上的应用潜力，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Motivation: 现有的问答基准测试方法无法直接评估模型的实际问题解决能力，本文旨在提供一种更全面、可推广的方法来解决此问题。

Method: 采用级联问题披露的框架，在每个阶段逐步揭示部分问题信息，引导模型进行更广泛的推理，同时收集其输出。

Result: 通过实验验证，提出的方法能够更好地比较不同规模和家族的大语言模型，并缩小现有问答评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 与标准问答评估相比，新框架更准确地反映了模型的能力，避免了对性能差异的高估，其有效性通过广泛消融实验得到进一步验证。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance

transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing

Motivation: 探讨多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在提高推理能力的同时，如何有效缓解其存在的显著社会偏见。

Method: 通过对比三种偏见减缓策略（监督微调、知识蒸馏、基于规则的强化学习）以建立基线，并调整偏见样本与推理样本比例，绘制推理与偏见减缓的平衡图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [167] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有AI系统在音频任务中表现灾难性失败，其性能在复杂听觉场景中与人类差距显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示现有AI系统在听觉任务上的弱点，并通过全新基准测试评估人机听觉差距。

Method: 设计包含917项挑战的听觉图灵测试，覆盖七大类别，测试现有的顶尖音频模型如GPT-4和Whisper。

Result: 最优模型仅达到6.9%的准确率，而人类成功率为52%，AI系统失败率超过93%。

Conclusion: AI在选择性注意、噪声鲁棒性及语境适应性等方面存在显著缺陷，需研发全新架构实现人类般的听觉场景分析能力。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出并定义了“论证一致性”特性，并评估其对人工和大语言模型预测的影响。结果表明，一致性过滤有助于提高预测准确性，同时指出用户对该特性的自然认同有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从论证视角研究预测一致性，探索其对人工和大语言模型预测准确性的影响。

Method: 正式定义“论证一致性”特性，通过一致性过滤在人类预测者和大语言模型预测者中进行实验评估，并通过众包用户实验评估用户对一致性特性的认同程度。

Result: 通过一致性过滤，能普遍提升人工和大语言模型（LLM）预测的准确性；用户实验显示，用户对这一特性的自然认同有限。

Conclusion: 在论证型预测中，需要机制剔除不一致的意见，以确保群体预测结果的准确性。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文讨论了基于Shapley值的责任度量在本体中介查询回答中的应用及其计算复杂性的研究，发现对于可重写成一阶逻辑公式的查询，其数据复杂性是多项式级。而包含复杂关系的情况则会变得计算困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于Shapley值的责任度量的复杂性及其在本体中介查询回答中的适用性。

Method: 利用数据库领域的相关成果，探讨不同类查询的计算复杂性，包括数据复杂性和整体复杂性。

Result: 发现一些查询的计算复杂性是多项式的，而在支持更复杂本体语言时问题变得困难。在特定DL-Lite方言中，提出限制性查询设计以实现更高效地计算。

Conclusion: 通过分析特定查询结构，可以在DL-Lite的受限类中实现责任度量的计算可行性，而更复杂的查询需要更先进的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过细化MILP调用来解决复杂实例的划分与征服方法，利用新型ReLU筛选评分（SAS）降低成本，同时保持高效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去有关通过ReLU变量分支来减少复杂性的方法效果不佳，而本文试图通过改进ReLU选择策略解决这一问题。

Method: 引入解决方案敏感的评分方法（SAS）和改进的分支函数作为全局评分机制（GS）；结合α,β-CROWN短时超时策略和分段MILP实现高效验证器。

Result: 在不牺牲准确度的前提下，SAS方法将二元变量数量减少约6倍；验证器使未决实例的数量减少至8-15%，平均用时控制在46s-417s，即便对较大的CNN（2百万参数）依然高效。

Conclusion: 通过新颖的ReLU评分和部分MILP调用，本研究显著优化了复杂实例求解的效率和精准度，展示了其在大规模CNN验证中的实用性。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of

develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway

we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented

external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible

for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

Result: 先进的推理模型在因果发现任务上表现优越，通过模块化的上下文框架实现了接近传统方法三倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型结合结构化的上下文框架，可以更好地实现因果发现，提供跨领域的通用性解决方案。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法缺乏形式上的严格性，而逻辑解释方法又对模型有严格假设，不适用于图像分类器，为此需要开发既形式严谨又适用的解释方法。

Method: 作者提出因果解释和对比因果解释，并引入考虑置信度的完整因果解释，采用了无需模型内部信息的黑盒算法实现这些解释方法。

Result: 实验显示不同模型具备不同的充分性、对比性和完整性模式，算法计算效率高，例如在ResNet50模型下每张图像平均耗时6秒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和适用性，能够高效地解释图像分类结果，并为解释模型行为提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过优化信任评估过程，在资源消耗与信任准确性之间取得了平衡，并支持大规模系统的多跳协作。

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在高效探索方面的不足，提出更优的个性化问题推荐系统。

Method: RAR方法融合了协作思想，改进了探索机制，可以在有限的训练回合内更有效地展开探索。

Result: 实验表明，RAR显著提升了推荐性能，并能应用于任何基于RL的问题推荐器。

Conclusion: RAR是一种有效且通用的新型个性化问题推荐框架。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

TL;DR: 文章提出一种新基准TextQuests，评估AI代理在复杂、探索性环境中的自主推理能力，尤其是在长时间和动态背景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试虽然能有效评估工具使用或结构化任务表现，但难以全面测量AI代理在需持续、自主推理的探索性环境中的表现。

Method: 作者设计了一个基准TextQuests，基于Infocom交互式小说游戏，评估大语言模型在无外部工具协助情况下的内在推理和长期问题解决能力。

Result: TextQuests能有效测试AI代理在动态探索环境中采用试错学习和持续问题解决的能力。

Conclusion: TextQuests为开发更强大的长时推理能力AI代理提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

TL;DR: 提出了Seed-Prover和Seed-Geometry两种系统，通过形式化验证与长推理链方法显著提升了数学定理证明能力，特别是在高中和大学数学竞赛层级上取得突破性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学推理上已经取得了一定成果，但在数学院中缺乏清晰的监督信号，尤其是自然语言形式的证明，严重限制了性能。选择形式化语言（如Lean）能够提供明确的验证路径，这是提升机器证明能力的关键所在。

Method: 提出基于Lean平台的Seed-Prover系统，通过吸收反馈机制、已证引理以及自我摘要循环优化证明过程，结合三种推理策略来解决高难度数学问题。此外，还开发了Seed-Geometry系统，专注于几何领域的形式化推理能力提升。

Result: Seed-Prover系统成功证明了78.1%的IMO历史题目，完全解决MiniF2F任务，并在PutnamBench上突破50%的准确率，全面超过现有最优方法。在IMO 2025中，结合Seed-Geometry解决了5/6道问题，展示了其显著优势。

Conclusion: 使用形式化验证结合长推理链的方式，能够显著提升自动化数学证明效率，表明这是一种解决高难度数学推理问题的有效方案，同时也为领域内未来研究以及竞赛型解题提供了重要示范。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct方法能够生成高质量的合成数据，显著改善推理和任务解决能力，展现了优越性。

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the

Motivation: 目前AI代理以任务导向为主，扩展性和通用性有限，而SimuRA目标是构建基于LLM的通用智能代理，吸取人类通过模拟推理的灵感。

Method: 提出SimuRA架构，通过引入基于自然语言的通用世界模型，实现通过模拟进行规划和推理。

Result: 在复杂的网络浏览任务中，SimuRA显著提高成功率，例如，在航班搜索任务中从0%提升到32.2%，其基于世界模型的规划比自回归模型提高最多124%。

Conclusion: SimuRA展现了基于LLM的通用代理的潜力，通过引入世界模型模拟推理，可以发展出能在多环境中表现超智能的AI代理，并开放了一个用于测试的网络浏览代理。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NeuroAR的新型脑老化模拟模型，基于生成自回归变换器（autoregressive transformers），展示出相比于目前主流生成模型的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对脑老化合成过程中数据维度高、跨年龄结构变化微妙且具个人化模式的挑战，开发更精准的预测模型。

Method: 开发NeuroAR模型，通过自回归方式估计未来扫描的离散token图，结合对象的先前扫描、扫描时年龄与目标年龄等信息进行多层次生成。

Result: 在老年人群与青少年样本中，NeuroAR在图像保真度上优于现有生成模型，包括LDM与生成对抗网络。

Conclusion: NeuroAR模型可以以高保真度模拟个体特定的脑老化轨迹，并有效生成与预期老化模式一致的合成图像。

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Motivation: 填补先前研究在语言覆盖性、认知背景和LLM参与粒度上的空白，探索击键动态在检测LLM辅助作弊中的可行性。

Method: 构建包含69名参与者的数据集，在Bona fide写作、ChatGPT回应转述和转录三种条件下完成覆盖Bloom分类的写作任务；提取时间与节奏特征，开发并评估多种分类器，关注认知分级影响和跨认知通用性。

Result: 时间特征在认知分级条件下表现优越，而节奏特征表现出良好的跨认知场景通用性；转述写作的检测难度大于转录和原创写作；模型显著优于人类评估者。

Conclusion: 击键动态是可靠的LLM辅助写作检测方法，即使在不同认知任务和写作策略的情况下也表现优异。

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MLPs在解释性、激活函数僵化及捕获局部或高频特征能力不足等限制，转向KANs是一种新趋势以克服这些问题。

Method: 从架构设计、训练策略、应用效率及与MLPs的对比评估等角度，系统化回顾与分类KANs在数据驱动学习、物理引导建模和深度算子学习方面的进展。

Result: 发现KANs在准确性、收敛性及频谱表示上相比MLPs有显著改善，并能更高效地捕捉复杂动态，同时提出现有的挑战与问题。

Conclusion: KANs具备更高灵活性和解释性的优势，是科学机器学习中重要的框架，但需在计算效率、理论保证、参数调整及算法复杂性方面进一步优化。

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

Motivation: 现有气候预警系统难以应对气候变化下的复杂多灾种情况，且缺乏对最新气候行为的学习能力。

Method: 结合序列深度学习模型（如BiLSTM）与时间序列的可解释性技术（TimeSHAP），利用美国四个主要农业区的气象数据，构建多灾种预测框架并增强对时间特性影响的解释。

Result: 框架展示了强大的预测精度，特别是在极寒、洪水、霜冻等多种极端天气事件预测中表现突出。此外，BiLSTM架构的表现尤为显著。

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Motivation: 心血管疾病每年导致1700多万人死亡，亟需隐私保护的预测系统。而现有的联邦学习框架未能充分集成非参数模型，存在通信开销和数据不平衡的挑战。

Method: 提出了FedCVD++框架，集成参数模型和非参数模型，通过树子集采样减少通信开销、基于XGBoost的特征提取以及联邦SMOTE同步解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 在Framingham数据集上，FedCVD++中联邦XGBoost模型F1达到0.80，超过中心化模型（F1=0.78），联邦Random Forest模型F1=0.81匹敌非联邦性能，同时通信效率提升3.2倍且准确率达95%。

Conclusion: FedCVD++首次实现在联邦医疗系统中有效应用非参数模型，为多机构部署提供隐私保护且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GSM-UTCI的多模态深度学习框架，用于快速预测高分辨率的户外热暴露指数，显著提高了城市热适应策略的评估效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模型在评估热暴露方面精确但计算成本高，而城市需要更高效且可扩展的工具来应对日益严重的热事件及规划需求。

Method: 该研究使用基于FiLM架构的深度学习模型，将地表形态数据、高分辨率地表覆盖数据与每小时气象条件相结合，预测昼间平均UTCI，并通过SOLWEIG数据进行训练和验证。

Result: GSM-UTCI在预测UTCI时取得了极高的准确性（R2 = 0.9151，MAE = 0.41°C），并将计算城市级UTCI的时间从数小时缩短至不到五分钟。同时，模型的模拟应用证明了不同地表覆盖类型（如树木、草地）在城市环境中的降温作用。

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI是一种可扩展的高分辨率工具，可用于评估城市绿化策略的降温潜力，为应对城市热环境提供了科学的决策支持。

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类心理和教育测试通常是为特定人群设计的，但目前这些测试被直接应用于非人类的LLMs，可能导致错误解读。

Method: 分析了将人类测试用于LLMs的理论和实证问题，提出开发AI特定评估框架的必要性，并建议可以借鉴现有心理测量测试的框架，或从零创建。

Result: 认为当前的评价方式缺乏充足的理论和实证基础，可能因为数据污染、文化偏差等问题带来误导性结论。

Conclusion: 不应再使用人类测试评估AI，应发展专门针对AI系统的评估方法，以更准确地表征AI能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

Motivation: 探索多模态任务特定AI模型中潜在空间实现逆向映射的潜力并发现其局限性。

Method: 提出基于优化的框架，在文本-图像和文本-音频两种多模态中进行双向逆任务实验。

Conclusion: 多模态潜在空间在逆向任务中的结构存在重大限制，需进一步研究构建真正语义丰富和可逆的潜在空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种硬件-软件协同设计框架KLLM，通过改进的K-Means量化和在线异常值检测引擎显著提升了大模型推理的速度和能效比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理中现有低精度量化方法带来的精度下降和异常值检测效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出了KLLM框架，该方法引入了基于索引的计算方案以实现K-Means量化数据的高效矩阵运算，同时提出了'Orizuru'在线异常值检测引擎以处理激活异常值。

Result: 实验表明，与A100 GPU和Atom相比，KLLM在推理速度上分别提升了9.67倍和7.03倍，能效提升了229.50倍和150.21倍。

Conclusion: KLLM通过消除去量化需求和优化激活异常值检测，为低精度的高效大模型推理提供了一种切实可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了传统流程挖掘中基于聚合和静态流程数据的方法的局限性，提出整合行为分析与因果检测的新方法以识别时间序列数据中的关联，证明行为对流程绩效的显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流程挖掘方法忽略了个体行为及其交互的时间性和因果性，对复杂真实世界流程的表现解读不充分。需要更具体的方法来揭示行为对流程结果的影响机制。

Method: 通过整合行为分析与Granger因果算法，分析真实事件日志中的行为交互时间序列（如连续性、中断和交接）与流程结果的因果关系，利用Group Lasso实现滞后时段选择，提取关键因果影响。

Result: 研究发现，行为有直接且可量化的对流程绩效（尤其是流通时间）的影响，确认了一组稳定的、小规模滞后时段对因果性影响显著。

Conclusion: 以演员为中心的时间序列分析方法能揭示流程结果中的时间依赖性，为理解行为对流程效率的影响提供了新视角，可提升流程优化方法的精准性。

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

Motivation: 万古霉素是ICU中用于严重革兰氏阳性菌感染的重要抗生素，但其肾毒性风险高。研究希望利用机器学习模型实现早期预测，帮助临床干预。

Method: 分析了10,288名18-80岁从MIMIC-IV数据库中接受万古霉素治疗的ICU患者，采用特征选择方法缩减变量，测试了六种算法，用交叉验证评估性能，并通过SHAP等方法分析模型可解释性。

Result: 研究显示CatBoost模型表现最佳，AUROC为0.818，敏感性为0.800，特异性为0.681，阴性预测值为0.900，磷、胆红素、镁等为主要预测因子。

Conclusion: 该机器学习模型可准确预测万古霉素相关的肌酐升高风险，实现早期风险检测和临床干预，具有较强的可解释性。

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Conclusion: 统一断裂预测模型架构提供了相较于特定仿真器工作流更具可扩展性的方法。

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: BiGG-E在生成加权图方面实现了更好的模型能力，兼顾了性能和计算效率，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: FLOSS提供了一种应对数据缺失挑战的解决方案，保障模型性能，同时兼顾隐私协议下用户的选择权。

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness

of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID

robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the

Conclusion: 研究提供了新的指标评估模型预测的任意性，并提出了改进决策安全性的方法。

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能使AI解算偏微分方程在多个自然和工程领域真正可用。

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

Result: 实验结果显示，FuseTen在多个日期的分析中优于线性基线，与传统方法相比，量化指标提升32.06%，视觉逼真度提升31.42%。

Conclusion: FuseTen是首个非线性方法，可生成高空间分辨率的日地表温度估计，为地表热状态研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

Motivation: 现有的有限差分方法在梯度优化中因偶然的零梯度产生误报，从而影响计算精准度，因此需要一种避免误报的创新技术。

Method: 通过系统地用NaN污染输入并观察输出是否变为NaN，利用NaN的传播特性来追踪输入输出依赖关系，构建保守的稀疏性模式。

Conclusion: 此方法具有跨语言兼容性，无需修改现有黑盒代码，并显著提高了稀疏性检测效率，适合广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文幻觉在AI中仍是一个重大挑战，需要更有效的检测和缓解机制。

Method: 通过在观察模型的残差流中使用线性探针，识别在生成器模型中将幻觉和忠实文本分离的线性方向，同时结合中层MLP子电路分析和梯度激活技术。

Result: 提出的方法比基线提高了5-27个点，并展示了在不同规模模型（2B至27B）上的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 发现了与幻觉检测和缓解相关的内在低维信号，这些信号可被应用于检测和因果干预。还发布了ContraTales基准以评估此类解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于增量学习的高效机器遗忘算法IAU，解决了现有方法计算开销过高的问题，并在多种数据集和模型上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法计算复杂且不可扩展，针对大规模模型及频繁数据删除的场景，现有方法难以适用。

Method: 将遗忘问题与认知科学中的记忆问题建立联系，提出一种基于增量学习视角的影响量近似遗忘算法（IAU），避免了计算Hessian矩阵的高昂开销。

Result: IAU在删除保证、遗忘效率和模型性能之间实现了优异的平衡，且在多种数据集和模型架构上优于目前的最优方法。

Conclusion: IAU通过从增量学习的角度解决遗忘问题，不仅提升了效率，还保持了模型效用，为大规模场景的数据安全需求提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统框架依赖静态协作图结构，缺乏适应性和效率。

Result: 在问答、数学推理、编码任务上表现优于当前单智能体和多智能体系统基线方法。

Conclusion: 动态图结构和样本感知的设计对于提升多智能体系统性能具有重要意义。

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Method: 提出了一种动态分析框架，通过跟踪训练中样本的FPR-TPR平面变化，量化个体样本的隐私泄漏动态。

Result: 发现样本的隐私风险与其学习难度相关，最终模型中易受攻击的样本隐私风险早在训练初期便已决定。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对隐私风险在训练中动态出现的理解，为隐私意识的训练策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

Result: 实现的SequenceLayers API减少了程序错误，便于创建流式大规模模型，并保证了正确性。

Conclusion: 提供了灵活且高可靠性的工具，支持生产规模序列建模，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 结构化的过程奖励能够有效加速大规模推理模型在数学推理任务中的优化，为更高效的强化学习训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的认证恢复技术在top-k预测中因攻击预算引起的投票数量膨胀而出现准确性问题，因此需要一种既可扩展又精确的方法，解决组合爆炸难题。

Method: 提出了CostCert，通过计算攻击预算是否不足以排除正确标签在前k预测标签中的可能性，避免了传统技术中进行成对比较和逐一枚举的复杂操作。

Result: 实验显示，CostCert对抗大补丁攻击时表现优异，例如在补丁大小为96时保持了57.3%的认证准确率，而现有最佳方法PatchGuard在这种情况下已降至零。

Conclusion: CostCert在top-k预测标签中成功实现了更精确且扩展性强的认证恢复，显著提升了对抗性补丁攻击下的防御效果。

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

Conclusion: 动态定价策略能够自然诱导共享单车站点的库存平衡，并通过适当的初始设定有效降低折扣成本。

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Conclusion: PLARE为安全关键场景的离线强化学习提供了一种无需奖励函数设计的高效方法，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

Result: 实验显示Coflex在网络准确性和能耗延迟比（EDP）上优于最先进的方法，并实现了1.9至9.5倍的计算加速。

Conclusion: Coflex有效解决了HW-NAS的可扩展性和计算成本问题，为边缘设备加速器的高效开发提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from
1.9x to 9.5x.

Conclusion: 流形正则化结合特征核的方案可以有效提升时间序列异常检测性能，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

Result: 得出模型平均法在特定条件下的最优性，并展示现代因果发现方法在量化因果结构不确定性方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种补充现有稳健因果推断方法的框架，专注于实践中通常被忽略的不确定性来源。

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方向性集成聚合方法（DEA），以解决连续控制任务中传统集成策略的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的策略通过保守的集成方法（如取最小值）来缓解Q值高估，但这些方法无法适应特定任务需求或不同的学习阶段。

Method: 提出了两个可完全学习的方向参数：一个调节评论方的保守性，另一个引导政策探索。通过基于Bellman误差的不确定性加权机制学习这两个参数，从而动态调整策略。

Result: 在多个连续控制基准和学习模式下验证，DEA表现优于静态集成策略。

Conclusion: 方向性集成聚合方法能够根据数据驱动自适应调整，可提升连续控制任务的学习性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证运行时间和证书复杂性之间的权衡，并揭示其对复杂性类分离和经典计算问题的影响。

Method: 证明了验证者权衡定理，表明缩短验证时间需要更长的证书，并提出一个基于证书复杂性的层级结构。

Result: 验证者权衡定理提供了对复杂性类分离的分析框架（如\(\np\)与\(\exptime\)）及对自然计算问题的研究结果。

Conclusion: 验证运行时间和证书长度存在内在权衡，这一理论为研究\(\p\)与\(\np\)问题等计算复杂性问题提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Method: 提出了适用于固定剪辑水平的DP-Clipped-SGD高概率收敛分析，基于中心α阶矩假设。

Result: 证明了方法在固定剪辑水平下以更快的速率收敛至邻域，同时在收敛速度与隐私保护之间实现了平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法在兼顾重尾噪声优化和隐私保护方面表现更加优化，与现有方法相比具有优势。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 解决连续学习中经验回放法效果受限于存储样本稀疏分布问题，同时改善模型的决策边界稳定性，减轻遗忘现象。

Method: 通过多变量差分隐私（DP）噪声机制生成决策边界附近合成数据（SBD），并结合存储样本与SBD进行端到端联合训练，形成“Experience Blending”框架。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上分别取得了10%、6%和13%的准确率提升，超过九种连续学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过Experience Blending框架有效提升了连续学习性能，验证了利用决策边界邻近的合成数据缓解遗忘的可行性。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Motivation: PEFT方法已广泛应用于LLMs，但其在边缘设备上小型模型（如CNN）的应用尚不充分研究。该研究的目的是分析并优化这些方法在资源受限的边缘环境中的表现。

Method: 本文对LoRA、DoRA、GaLore等PEFT方法进行了基准测试，并利用PyTorch分析工具对标准卷积架构和深度分离卷积架构进行了性能和计算成本的评估。同时考察了不同秩维的更新行为。

Result: 研究发现：PEFT方法在深度分离卷积架构中内存效率仅为LLMs的一半，但在边缘部署优化时，其适配器方法可以减少多达95%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: 基于硬件约束、性能需求和应用需求选择PEFT方法时，研究结果提供了有价值的指导。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is
online.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power

advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze

Motivation: 解决高维特征选择问题，希望在保证准确率的同时，选出更紧凑和解释性强的特征集。

Method: 将特征选择视为一个组合优化问题，利用模拟退火算法在特征子集空间中进行全局搜索，并用Fisher判别率作为模型质量的高效代理指标。

Result: SA-FDR在包含几十万样本和数百特征的数据集上，实现了更紧凑的特征选择，同时保持了高预测准确率。

Conclusion: SA-FDR能有效捕捉特征间依赖关系，优于贪心方法，在模型稀疏性、可解释性和性能至关重要的高维设置中提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

Motivation: 传统MCR方法依赖于用户指定组件数量，且无法有效扩展至大规模数据集或高组分数的场景。

Method: 将MCR重构为生成过程(gMCR)，并利用基于能量的深度学习求解器EB-gMCR，通过一个可微分的门控网络筛选活跃组件并估算其浓度。

Result: 在含有多达256个潜在源的噪声模拟数据集上，EB-gMCR的R^2值达到≥0.98，且组分估计误差在5%以内。在噪声较低时，R^2提升至≥0.99且组分几近精准。

Conclusion: EB-gMCR方案结合高容量生成建模与硬件组件选择，为大规模信号分解分析提供了实用的新途径，并可以适应不同领域和仪器。

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Result: 在真实的临床试验数据上进行实验，提出的方法比现有模型在患者入组预测中表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究证明采用语言模型与概率建模结合的方法能显著提高临床试验患者入组预测效能。

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

Conclusion: L-GTA模型能够提供更加可靠、一致、可控的时间序列数据增强方法，在多个任务中表现优越。

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

Result: 显示了线性注意力是softmax注意力的近似形式，通过RNN语言增强了对softmax优势的理解。

Conclusion: softmax注意力中的特定组件和结构提供了重要表现，解释其为何优于线性注意力方法。

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Conclusion: 该研究通过多维度的防御机制以及新的联邦学习优化方法，有效提升了模型在异质数据和攻击条件下的性能及稳健性，为联邦学习提供了抗攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains
vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present
OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data
heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch
Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence
trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI
datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant
improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage

Conclusion: 提出了一种创新的基于解释性的正则化方法，使机器学习模型更准确、更可靠。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

Result: TweakLLM在保持与前沿模型相当的响应质量的同时，显著提升了缓存效果与效率。

Conclusion: TweakLLM是一种高效、可扩展的缓存解决方案，可支持高流量大型语言模型部署，同时不影响用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

Motivation: 现有的扩散政策在在线强化学习中表现优异，但受限于慢速的迭代采样。本研究旨在提升推断速度。

Method: 基于分布方差与插值流匹配模型单步采样离散误差的理论联系，提出了两种方法：Flow Policy与MeanFlow Policy。

Result: 通过MuJoCo基准测试表明，与扩散政策基线相比，算法在减少推断计算的同时，性能相当，推断函数调用减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: FPMD算法通过减少推断开销，为在线强化学习场景提供了高效的解决方案，同时保持了与扩散政策相当的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微生物群数据呈现稀疏性和噪声，导致现有插补方法难以准确捕捉微生物间复杂的依赖关系以及忽略上下文元数据。

Method: 提出DepMicroDiff框架，该框架将扩散生成模型与依赖感知Transformer结合，捕捉微生物间复杂依赖关系，使用VAE预训练，并通过LLM对患者元数据编码进行条件化处理。

Result: 在TCGA微生物群数据集上的实验证明，DepMicroDiff明显优于最新方法，在Pearson相关性（最高0.712）、余弦相似度（最高0.812）、RMSE和MAE方面表现卓越。

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff证明了其在微生物群数据插补任务中的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，对于支持下游任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

Conclusion: 结合异常样本的多分数异常检测方法及其验证技术有效提升了异常分类效果，尤其是在样本稀少的情况下。

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动学习在减少标注数据需求上具有优势，但仍需降低因注释者内部因素导致的标注错误，以快速实现精准学习。

Method: 研究通过构建知识推荐系统（RS），结合注释者过往准确率、心情和疲劳水平等特征，对可用注释者进行排名并分配查询任务，从而模拟和预测实际表现。

Conclusion: 研究填补了注释者内部因素对主动学习影响的研究空白，提出的方法能够有效提高主动学习效率和模型性能。

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Result: CODA在26个基准任务上验证表现优越，与以往的主动模型选择方法相比，减少了超过70%的标注工作量。

Conclusion: CODA显著提高了模型选择的效率，是一种成本更低、更高效的主动模型选择方法。

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: 该模型在信息传输和节律生成方面与生物神经元的双重功能表现出了明确的类比性，为其在神经形态工程中的更广泛应用奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

Motivation: FDTR技术用于多层薄膜的热性能测定，但多参数提取导致形式化的高维度非线性问题需要可靠和快速的解决方案。

Method: 评估GA、QGA、PSO和FWA四种优化算法，并提出结合Quasi-Newton局部优化法的AI驱动混合框架，形成HGA、HQGA、HPSO、HFWA四种混合算法，并用目标适应度和收敛速度进行实验比较。

Result: HPSO在短时（60秒）和长时（1000秒）实验中实现最优表现，60秒内80%的实验达到目标精度，比其他混合算法更鲁棒，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: HPSO在热计量学逆问题和模型拟合方法中提供了通用解决方案，具备良好的推广潜力。

Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for
characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting
multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem
due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

Method: 提出PancreasDG数据集，收集了六个机构共563份多序列的3D MRI扫描，并通过盲审两步法生成胰腺的像素精确分割掩码；同时分析胰腺领域泛化问题，并提出一种半监督方法利用解剖不变性提升分割性能。

Result: 实验表明，提出的半监督方法相比现有领域泛化技术提升了Dice得分61.63%，在两个测试中心实现了87.00%的跨序列分割准确率。

Conclusion: PancreasDG数据集弥补了现有跨领域基准在胰腺分割方面的空白，显著提升了领域泛化技术性能，为医学影像领域泛化问题提供了新基准和方法。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.
