Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for
multi-view skill assessment: (1) a multi-task learning framework using
Sapiens-2B that jointly predicts proficiency and scenario labels (43.6 %

*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种面向农业图像处理的框架，通过提示词机制和自一致性方法提高视图语言模型（VLM）在精准农业领域中的可靠性，并实现了疾病诊断、症状分析和治疗建议的精确提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业中需要高度准确的图像分析以识别作物疾病并推荐治疗，但现有的视图语言模型（VLM）在农业领域表现不足。

Method: 提出了一种域感知的农业图像处理框架，包括：（1）基于提示的评估协议，将语言模型配置为植物病理学专家；（2）基于余弦一致性自投票机制，通过生成多个候选响应并利用领域适应嵌入选择语义一致的疾病诊断。

Result: 针对玉米叶病识别，与传统的贪婪解码方法相比，该方法使诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [4] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了文本到图像生成模型的可靠性问题，提出了一套评估框架，发现当前模型在生成符合提示要求的图像方面表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态模型和文本到图像生成模型的研究不足，其可靠性较低，因此需要建立更全面的评估框架。

Method: 研究者创建了新数据集，通过gpt-4o生成和评估图像描述文本，并比较生成图像与输入提示间的一致性，同时使用预训练的VAE检验生成图像的分布。

Result: 结果表明，模型在生成简单的二元图像以及匹配输入分布方面表现出较大困难。

Conclusion: 当前主流文本到图像生成模型如Stable Diffusion和Janus在提示依从性和分布匹配上仍有较多局限性。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [5] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于LoRA权重矩阵初始化的方法，称为ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA)，以改进模型收敛速度和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低秩适配器 (LoRA) 在初始权重随机选择及固定秩值可能影响模型性能的问题，研究提出采用数据驱动的权重初始化改进方法。

Method: 以权重初始化视为领域迁移问题，通过利用多个与预训练权重和微调激活相关的约束，采用闭式求解方法得出权重估计值，从而无需训练即可完成初始化。进一步引入灵活可变秩值对LoRA权重的上行和下行矩阵进行初始化。

Result: 经过实际任务测试（如图像生成、分类和理解），CNTLoRA在定量和定性上均优于传统及其他数据驱动的权重初始化方法。同时，进一步分析揭示了框架设计中的关键选择，提供了优化收敛和性能的建议。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA有效提升了LoRA微调的性能和收敛速度，是一种更高效的权重初始化方法，有助于实现更优的微调效果。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [6] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多层极限学习机的混合方法，用于图像分类和无人机应用场景，表现优于类似方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自然信号如图像分类的需求，提高分类性能。

Method: 设计了一种结合ELM自编码器和区间二型模糊逻辑的新型HML-ELM方法，分为无监督特征提取与监督特征分类两个阶段。

Result: 在基准问题和四种物体的无人机图像分类实验中证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: HML-ELM在图像分类中表现显著优于其他类似方法，尤其是ML-ELM和ML-FELM。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as

Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of

image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [8] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨在扩散模型噪声处理算法中，将高斯噪声替换为非高斯噪声时，算法性能的影响及分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，基于扩散模型的去噪算法在处理高斯噪声时表现良好，但对其处理非高斯噪声的能力尚未深入研究，因此需要探索这种影响。

Method: 在算法不变的情况下，用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布噪声、Beta分布噪声、具有不同方差的高斯混合噪声）替代高斯噪声，并观察其对算法性能的影响。所有实验在小型笔记本上对最小图片尺寸进行。

Result: 研究发现了算法在使用非高斯噪声时与设计支持的高斯噪声情况下的性能表现差异，具体实验数据和分析未在内容中给出。

Conclusion: 初步验证了在非高斯噪声下，算法可能表现出不同性能。这为进一步探讨扩散模型对非高斯噪声的适应性提供了启发及挑战。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [10] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RegGS，一种基于3D高斯注册的框架，用于无位姿稀疏视图的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对优化方法在稀疏视图情况下表现差，以及前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式的问题，提出了新方法RegGS。

Method: 采用熵正则化Sinkhorn算法解决最优传输问题，并设计3DGS注册模块整合多个一致性指标，实现相机位姿估计及场景对齐。

Result: 实验表明，RegGS能有效注册局部高斯，获得高精度的位姿估计及新视图质量。

Conclusion: RegGS能解决稀疏无位姿图像的挑战，为高质量场景重建提供了解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个从单目视频中重建动态人机交互场景的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不连续性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法假设对象静止或动态主体完全可见，但实际中遮挡和运动会导致性能下降。

Method: 使用非模板方法结合时间上下文，通过amodal completion推断被遮挡的区域结构，同时强制视频序列的时序一致性以逐步优化和稳定重建。

Result: 通过3D Gaussian Splatting方法验证，在处理遮挡和保持时间稳定性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架无模板适应各种场景条件，可精确恢复动态场景的复杂细节。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing的方法，用于在对抗性样本下认证视觉模型的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对对抗性样本问题并提升模型的认证和精确度。

Method: 将引导去噪扩散模型重新解释为多个自适应高斯差分隐私机制的组合，并通过GDP隐私过滤器证明其鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet上的$\ell_2$威胁模型中，可以同时提升认证精度和标准精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效扩展了自适应随机平滑分析，并通过新的引导策略改进了模型性能。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [14] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HNOSeg-XS的架构，通过傅里叶神经算子处理图像分割任务，实现了零次超分辨率能力，且与其他传统的CNN和Transformer模型相比更高效且参数量更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CNN和Transformer在长程空间相关性捕获和计算复杂性上的限制，现有模型在处理高分辨率医学图像分割时效率有限。本文试图通过设计一种新架构解决这一问题。

Method: 作者提出了基于Hartley变换的HNOSeg-XS模型，其通过在频域中重新定义图像分割问题，并采用傅里叶神经算子以实现计算和内存的高效性。

Result: 在BraTS'23、KiTS'23、MVSeg'23数据集测试中，HNOSeg-XS以不到34.7k的模型参数显现出优越的分辨率鲁棒性，并实现了最佳的推理时间（低于0.24秒）和内存占用效率（低于1.8 GiB）。

Conclusion: 新提出的HNOSeg-XS架构不仅在分辨率鲁棒性上表现出色，还显著减少了计算复杂性，在多个医学图像分割数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Method: SurfDist 在StarDist-3D的架构基础上进行修改，用光滑的Bézier三角形表示对象表面，并解决参数化耦合问题，允许分割结果任意高分辨率地放大而不引入伪影。

Result: 实验结果表明，SurfDist在处理球形实例（常见于生物医学图像）数据集上表现优于StarDist-3D，并具有更紧凑的实例参数化方案。

Conclusion: SurfDist实现了可解释的实例表面建模，并能够有效地与实例成员关系学习结合，在生物医学和合成数据集上都表现良好。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

Method: 开发了一个基于智能手机的视频采集应用及新颖的算法，用于拟合生物力学模型，并通过大规模临床数据集对其进行验证。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SAR分辨率的提升，其散射特性差异导致目标检测模型泛化能力下降，需要一种解决域适应问题的新方法。

Method: CR-Net方法结合了结构驱动的分层特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA），以结构意识的特征适应和安全邻接集增强语义对齐。

Result: CR-Net通过保持域内结构和提升可辨识性，实现了跨分辨率数据的显著提升，实验结果表明其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CR-Net方法在跨分辨率SAR目标检测领域展现了出色的性能，解决了因分辨率差异引起的域适应难题，为相关研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在医学图像分析中取得了显著进展，但其模型规模大且透明性不足，限制了其临床应用。

Method: 引入了一种解释性驱动的修剪框架，通过保留神经网络中对预测最相关的部分实现有针对性的压缩。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法在高压缩率的同时仅导致最小的准确性损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计轻量级且可解释的模型铺平了道路，适合于在医疗实际环境中的部署。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以往生成模型依赖额外视觉提示导致解释性和组合性受限的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散能量函数的生成模型CoCo-Bot，完全通过显式概念传递信息，消除了对辅助视觉提示的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，与使用StyleGAN2的基准模型相比，CoCo-Bot在概念层面的可控性和解释性上均有提升，同时维持了视觉质量的竞争力。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过增强解释性和控制能力，展示了其在生成模型中的应用潜力，尤其是在完全依赖概念的情景中。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Conclusion: 本文为跨癌种多模态预后模型的研究奠定了基础，通过显著提升模型的通用性，推动了该领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Result: MRAG通过实验展现了其在隐藏信息的可恢复性和隐蔽性上的高性能。

Conclusion: MRAG框架有效提升了深度隐写技术的不可检测性及性能，是当前该领域的领先方法。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学图像标注的稀缺性和上下文图像掩膜对齐的重要性，ICL在医疗领域的应用面临挑战，特别是最优上下文对的选择和基础模型微调的可行性限制。

Method: 提出了CCV框架，利用循环管道生成分割结果并交换图像角色进行验证，通过更新查询提示来优化上下文对齐，从而改进模型性能。

Result: 基于两个ICL基础模型，在七个医学图像分割数据集上评估了CCV，实验结果表明其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCV通过改进上下文对齐和分割验证，显著提升了ICL在医学图像分割中的适用性，是一种鲁棒的通用医学图像分割解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在交通场景中的应用潜力，特别是在涉及需要情境推理的老年驾驶员评估任务中。

Method: 通过零样本、少样本和多样本提示设计策略，利用人类标注作为参考标准，使用精确度、召回率和F1分数等指标对模型进行性能评估。

Result: 结果表明提示设计显著影响了模型表现，例如交叉口可视性的召回率从零样本的21.7%提高到多样本的57.0%，而停车标志辨识的精确度达到86.3%。

Conclusion: 经过良好的提示设计，LLM具有作为驾驶场景风险评估辅助工具的潜力，但建议未来研究需结合更大数据集、多样化标注者及下一代模型架构以提升其规模及性能。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Abstract: Video restoration and enhancement are critical not only for improving visual
quality, but also as essential pre-processing steps to boost the performance of
a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks. This survey presents a
comprehensive review of video restoration and enhancement techniques with a
particular focus on unsupervised approaches. We begin by outlining the most
common video degradations and their underlying causes, followed by a review of
early conventional and deep learning methods-based, highlighting their
strengths and limitations. We then present an in-depth overview of unsupervised
methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain
translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based
methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in
unsupervised video restoration and enhancement, and discuss the role of paired
synthetic datasets in enabling objective evaluation. Finally, we identify key
challenges and outline promising directions for future research in this field.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为通用强化理解（GEFU）的新范式，将低光增强与视觉理解相结合，提升了通用性与可扩展性，实验表明超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前低光图像增强和低光视觉理解的方法存在通用性差、评估局限且标注数据匮乏的问题，作者希望建构在这两者间的统一桥梁。

Result: 所提出方法在图像质量及分类、检测、语义分割等多项任务上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GEFU通过创新方法和广泛实验验证，实现了低光增强与高层次视觉理解的统一，并显著提高了多任务性能。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 该数据集为艺术作品对象检测与视觉文化遗产研究提供了新方向，并鼓励研究者探索对象识别与气味感知间的关系。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations

such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

TL;DR: CoDi是一种面向文本到图像（T2I）生成的框架，能实现主体身份的一致性和多姿态多布局生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在主体一致性和姿态多样性之间存在权衡问题，限制了视觉故事表达的丰富性。

Method: 提出了一个名为CoDi的两阶段方法：身份迁移（IT）和身份精炼（IR）。IT在去噪的早期阶段通过最优传输实现目标图像的姿态感知的身份特征迁移；IR在去噪的后期通过选择显著身份特征进一步细化主体细节。

Result: 实验表明CoDi在主体一致性、姿态多样性和提示符合性上均表现优越，视觉效果和性能指标全面提升。

Conclusion: CoDi框架在整合主体一致性和多样化生成方面表现出明显优势，为文本到图像生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PanMatch的通用模型，用于鲁棒的匹配任务，通过2D位移估计框架统一处理不同匹配任务，无需特定架构或领域微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前匹配任务通常依赖特定任务的架构和微调，难以泛化。作者旨在通过统一模型解决这一局限，提升通用性。

Method: 开发了一个2D位移估计框架，结合从大型视觉模型中提取的全能特征，利用跨域数据预训练以实现多任务整合。

Result: PanMatch在多领域和下游任务中展示了卓越性能，超过许多跨任务评估方法，并在非正常场景下提供了前所未有的零样本表现。

Conclusion: PanMatch证明了单模型泛化多个匹配任务的潜力，大幅降低了特定架构和微调的需求，同时在非正常场景下展现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的深度哈希方法SHC，通过生成语义哈希中心显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的深度哈希方法生成哈希中心时，未考虑类别间的语义关系，可能影响检索性能。

Method: 构建三阶段框架SHC：利用分类网络计算类别间语义相似性，优化生成语义哈希中心，并训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: SHC在大规模检索任务中的MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别提升+7.26%、+7.62%和+11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心的引入在不同数据集上的检索性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MuGCP的新方法，通过引入多模态互导条件提示学习，显著提高了视觉-语言模型在多模态任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的提示学习方法在未见类的泛化能力不足，且在跨模态对齐方面仅限于最终输出层，限制了模型的嵌入一致性。

Method: 提出了一个多模态互导条件提示学习的框架MuGCP，包括三个主要模块：多模态语义条件提示生成器（SCP）、注意力互导模块（AMG）和多提示融合机制（MPF），以在多模态空间内实现更好的信息交互和对齐。

Result: MuGCP在14个不同的数据集上优于当前的先进方法，证明了其卓越的性能。

Conclusion: 引入的MuGCP框架通过改进提示生成与信息交互，为视觉-语言模型在多模态任务中的应用提供了显著提升。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类自然能够完成遮挡物体的情况下，机器人仍然难以从部分观察中识别并完成完整对象的构建。本文试图提供一种新方法解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了空间对比学习技术以增强场景分解的语义监督，同时通过原地生成导入3D生成模型，结合观察和几何线索以实现更完整的对象重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，InstaScene在复杂的真实和合成场景中，能够显著提升场景分解的准确性，同时生产几何形态逼真且视觉完整的对象。

Conclusion: InstaScene提供了一种有效方法，通过分解和重建实例，实现了对复杂场景中对象的完整3D感知。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RALU的框架以加速扩散变压器的推理，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变压器因计算负担过重影响了实际应用，需要设计更高效的方法以加速推理。

Method: 采用无需训练的三阶段RALU框架，包括低分辨率去噪、特定区域自适应高分辨率上采样以及全局高分辨率细节校正，并引入噪声时间步重新调度以稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX上实现7倍加速，在Stable Diffusion 3上实现3倍加速，且图像质量基本无损。

Conclusion: RALU有效减少了计算负担，能够与现有加速方法结合进一步降低延迟，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了可能性。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Result: 该方法提升了修复场景的几何逼真度和外观一致性。

Conclusion: 通过参考视图引导，能显著改善复杂场景的3D修复效果，为实践应用提供新的可能性。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法显著改进了图像生成和分词效率，展示了预训练基础模型的新应用潜力，代码将在未来公开以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 新技术拓宽了3D重建的应用前景，但仍需解决模型精度、可扩展性及动态场景处理等问题。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Motivation: 传统文件识别方法将文件识别视为计算机视觉问题，忽略文档类型特有的结构特性，导致对罕见或复杂文档类型的处理效果较差。

Method: 提出一种基于结构特定归纳偏差的端到端文档识别系统方法，并引入一种新的Transformer架构，根据文档结构优化模型表现，同时适配图结构等复杂信息。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于现有文档识别系统不覆盖的复杂文档类型，有望统一未来文档基础模型的设计。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Conclusion: F3-Net是一个多功能且可扩展的解决方案，将深度学习研究与实际临床应用连接起来。

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research
and practical clinical deployment.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究行人再识别任务中的遮挡问题，提出了一种基于强化知识蒸馏的遮挡引导特征净化学习方法（OGFR）来解决现有方法中存在的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决遮挡问题时面临难以处理未见过的多样化遮挡场景及特征污染的挑战。为此，本文旨在通过新的方法改进特征表征的可靠性。

Method: 提出OGFR框架，采用教师-学生架构，通过强化知识蒸馏促进纯净判别性全局知识的传递；设计遮挡感知视觉变换器和特征擦除与净化模块，分别对遮挡模式进行建模与优化特征表示中的噪声问题。

Conclusion: 本文方法成功消除了遮挡问题中的特征污染与处理未知遮挡场景的问题，显著提升了行人再识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval是一种3D内容检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入以支持基于肿瘤级别的检索，能够利用图像形状、位置或部分特征进行灵活查询，并在公开数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注查询，这限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 提出RadiomicsRetrieval框架，利用基于对比学习将放射组学特征与深度学习图像嵌入对齐，并加入解剖学位置嵌入进行增强，支持灵活的基于形状、位置或者部分特征集的查询。

Result: 在肺部CT和脑部MRI公开数据集上，验证了RadiomicsRetrieval框架通过放射组学特性提升检索专属性，解剖学位置嵌入提供全局解剖学上下文。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval能通过最小用户提示（如单点分割）高效支持多种临床场景，适配性强，可服务于医学成像大规模存储库的诊断、治疗规划及研究工作。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种使用强化学习优化SAM 2记忆更新的方法，显著超过已有启发式方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过手工设计更新规则提升SAM 2性能，但限制了模型潜力。

Method: 将记忆更新建模为序列决策问题，通过强化学习进行优化训练，从而提升记忆控制的有效性。

Result: 提出的强化学习方法在每视频单独代理的过拟合设置中，性能提升三倍以上，显著优于当前启发式方法。

Conclusion: 强化学习可替代现有手工更新规则，挖掘记忆库潜能，促进视觉对象跟踪的性能提升。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义分割对真实世界数据标注困难，以及现有未配对图像翻译方法导致的语义匹配不稳定问题。

Method: 提出DA-KPN方法，通过估算像素级输入的转换参数实现语义匹配，同时使用多尺度判别器保证生成图像的真实感。

Result: 在syn2real基准测试中优于现有GAN方法，且在人脸解析任务上表现出与现有方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: DA-KPN方法改进了未配对图像翻译的语义一致性问题，对于语义分割任务表现突出。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双流范式（DISC），在单帧输入下通过分离的优化方案增强了实例和场景类别的学习，取得了目前最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在3D语义场景补全中，基于体素的交互方式限制了对类别级信息的充分利用，而类别级信息对提高补全结果的精细度至关重要。

Method: 提出采用区分性类别查询代替体素查询，并设计专门的解码模块以促进类别级信息流动，从而实现对实例和场景类别的分离优化。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360上分别获得17.35和20.55的mIoU分数，单帧输入优于多帧方法，提高了实例类别的mIoU，分别较当前单帧和多帧的SOTA方法提升了17.9%和11.9%。

Conclusion: DISC方法能够显著提升3D语义场景补全的性能，特别是在单帧输入情况下对类别级信息的有效利用，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is
available at https://github.com/Enyu-Liu/DISC.

2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D

spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出BayesTTA模型，用于解决视觉语言模型在持续时间演变的分布迁移情境下的适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在逐步分布迁移环境常遇到灾难性遗忘、误差积累及静态表示失效等问题，因而需要一种实用于此情境的新方法。

Method: BayesTTA通过贝叶斯框架生成时间一致性预测，动态对齐视觉表示，基于高斯判别分析进行校准推理，与可测统计结构适配，并结合自适应标准化调整。

Result: 在四个时序演变数据集测试基准和十个TTA数据集广泛实验中，BayesTTA均显著优于现有方法，取得显著提升并保持高效性。

Conclusion: BayesTTA展示了在持续-时间测试情境下的强大适应能力，为相关问题提出了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索有效的注释策略与训练方法以最大限度减少手工工作量，同时提升DAN在手写西班牙文档上的信息提取性能。

Method: 通过实验对两种使用不同注释方法的出生证明数据集分别进行测试，评估标准化注释和外交注释的效果，并比较它们在不同字段上的表现。

Result: 标准化注释在日期和出生地等可标准化字段上效果更好，而外交注释在无法标准化的字段（如名字和姓氏）上表现更优。

Conclusion: 注释方法的选择对于手写文档中不同类型信息的提取效果至关重要，应根据字段特性合理选择注释方式以优化性能。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种称为OnlineBEV的新方法，通过递归结构组合BEV特征，实现更高效的3D感知。在nuScenes数据集的实验中，OnlineBEV在相机仅3D目标检测任务中达到63.9%的NDS，表现优于现有最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Motivation: 现有基于多视角相机的3D感知方法在结合多帧BEV特征时表现有限，尤其是面对动态场景中的特征变化。

Method: 提出OnlineBEV方法，基于递归结构融合时间序列BEV特征，并通过MBFNet动态对齐历史与当前特征，同时引入时间一致性学习损失来提升特征对齐效果。

Result: 通过nuScenes数据集实验，OnlineBEV相较于SOLOFusion取得显著性能提升，达到63.9%的NDS，创下相机仅3D目标检测新纪录。

Conclusion: 本文展示了结合动态特征对齐与时间一致性学习的新方法OnlineBEV显著提升了3D感知能力，为相机仅3D目标检测任务设立了新的基准。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够根据用户需求构建高质量图像数据集，证明了其在提升视觉模型性能方面的潜力，同时提供了一种高效的数据集构建方案。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于Transformer的模型7T-Restormer，用于从1.5T或3T T1W图像合成7T质量的T1地图，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有高分辨率和高对比度，但因昂贵和难以广泛应用，限制了其使用。因此，有必要开发一种简便的方法，从常规的1.5T或3T扫描生成7T图像。

Method: 作者设计了7T-Restormer模型，并通过141例患者数据（1.5T和3T对7T T1地图的成对数据）对模型进行训练和验证。

Result: 7T-Restormer在各种指标上均优于现有模型，特别是NMSE减少了64%，使用的参数数量更少，训练采用了混合1.5T+3T数据集的策略，进一步提高了性能。

Conclusion: 7T-Restormer模型成功从1.5T和3T T1W图像生成高质量7T MP2RAGE地图，可将7T MRI的优势引入常规临床工作流程中。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Conclusion: ByDeWay是一种轻量化、模块化且适用于黑盒MLLMs的框架，证明了深度感知提示策略在零训练情况下的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的对比学习框架MoSAiC，专注于多模态卫星影像的表征学习，并在小标注和高类间重叠场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习框架在表征地球系统观测数据时存在不足，特别是面对高类间相似性、场景复杂和多标签对齐问题。

Method: 提出一种名为MoSAiC的框架，将模态内和模态间的对比学习与多标签监督对比损失相结合，适用于多模态卫星影像表征学习。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上的实验表明，MoSAiC在准确率、聚类一致性和泛化性能方面优于全监督和自监督的基线方法。

Conclusion: MoSAiC框架为小标注、类间高度重叠的多模态卫星影像提供了更优的表征学习方法，可在数据复杂的环境下实现更精细的语义解耦和稳健的表征学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Motivation: 目前MRI肌肉分割因高计算成本、大量训练数据需求和对小型肌肉分割精度低的问题，发展受限。

Method: 引入无需训练的分割方法，通过关键点跟踪结合Lucas-Kanade光流技术实现分割。

Result: 提出的方法在Dice相似系数（DSC）上达到0.6至0.7，与现有CNN方法性能相当，并显著减少计算需求。

Conclusion: 这一具备可扩展性的框架提供了一种更鲁棒且可解释的MRI肌肉分割替代方案，适用于临床和科研应用。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种轻量级的基于嵌入的描述生成评估指标L-CLIPScore，通过压缩和蒸馏CLIP模型来实现高效的描述生成质量评估和训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本描述评估方法在计算资源上较为昂贵或效果不足，需开发一种高效且准确的方法。

Method: 通过权重多路复用和矩阵分解实现压缩，同时设计了多模态相似性调节损失来进行知识蒸馏，提升轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的多模态对齐能力。

Result: L-CLIP在减少计算资源和运行时间的情况下达到了与原始CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力。L-CLIPScore在评估描述质量时表现有效，并发现其需与n-gram指标结合以用于监督训练。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore是一种高效且轻量化的指标，可用于描述生成评估，并且在特定条件下适合作为训练监督。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的基于稀疏高斯过程(SGP)的MIL框架SGPMIL，可以进行实例级别不确定性估计，同时实现高效和竞争性的袋级性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MIL方法中对实例相关性不确定性估计不足的问题，尤其在处理数字病理中的大规模图像时的需求。

Method: 通过引入SGPMIL这一新的概率注意力框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并在预测均值函数中引入特征缩放机制。

Result: SGPMIL实现了更可靠和校准的实例相关性图，不仅保留了袋级性能，还显著提高了实例级别预测的质量与可解释性，并加速了训练。

Conclusion: SGPMIL框架有效改进了MIL在不确定性量化和数字病理分析中的性能，将推广至更多的实例和袋级评测场景。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有数据集在场景简单化、分辨率低、条件单一等方面存在局限性，难以满足学术研究到实际中的转化需求。

Method: 创建了RoundaboutHD数据集，该数据集包含由四个非重叠的4K分辨率摄像头记录的40分钟标注视频数据，标注了512个车辆身份，并加入了时间一致性、遮挡和非线性运动等现实挑战。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The
dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at:

Motivation: 计算机视觉问题中，因训练数据不足导致模型性能受限，本文旨在通过弱学习器集成技术缓解此问题。

Method: 利用基于谱总变差（STV）特征的弱学习器构建集成模型，针对医学图像预测问题进行测试，并与深度学习和Radiomics方法进行性能对比。

Result: STV学习器在PET图像高放射性摄取预测中表现突出（AUC=0.87），优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: 细尺度的STV特征对于CT图像中预测PET高放射性摄取值具有特别高的预测力，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HieraRS的新模型，旨在解决现有深度学习方法在LCLU（层次化土地覆盖和土地利用）分类中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型无法进行多粒度分层预测，且在跨域任务中表现不足，无法适应异构层次结构的场景。

Method: 引入双向层次一致性约束机制BHCCM，整合到主流分类模型中生成层次预测；并设计了跨域迁移框架TransLU，用于适配不同领域的异构层级结构。

Conclusion: HieraRS及其框架方法展现了在跨域任务中的适配能力与灵活性，为LCLU模型带来更广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Result: 实验表明，FedMeta-GeoLane在多种场景中相较基线模型有更低的几何误差和更强的泛化能力，同时显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT为数字孪生中的灵活和上下文感知的基础设施建模提供了新思路，为智能交通系统开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为Birkhoff的新型数据无关压缩算法用于高性能的Segment Anything Model (SAM)及其变体，能够显著提高模型压缩效果及推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在各种场景中的高效使用，尤其是无需要微调的数据集分割，对其进行有效压缩成为一个重要需求。

Method: 提出了一种名为Birkhoff的方法，通过全新的“Hyper-Compression”算法将高维参数向量有效转化为低维标量，并设计了HyperLinear线性层操作以加速压缩后的模型推理。

Result: 通过COCO、LVIS和SA-1B数据集的18个SAM模型测试，Birkhoff在压缩时间、比率、性能和推理速度上均表现出良好效果。例如，对SAM2-B实现5.17x的压缩比，性能下降不足1%，且所有模型压缩在60秒内完成。

Conclusion: Birkhoff展现出对SAM及其变体良好的通用性、快速扫描、对原模型的忠实性以及紧凑的模型结构，证明了其在模型压缩中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分分解减少编码复杂性，支持明确的部分关系建模，以及部分级别的条件控制，提供了高度的生成可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种表示场景的神经渲染方法，利用“压缩光场令牌（CLiFTs）”高效保留了场景的外观和几何信息，支持在不同的计算预算下渲染新视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的神经渲染方法需要大量的计算资源和数据存储，难以在有限计算预算内实现高质量渲染。因此，需要一种能够在减少数据规模的同时保证渲染质量的技术。

Method: 首先，通过多视图编码器结合相机位姿对图像进行令牌化，再利用潜在空间的K-means算法选择射线作为聚类中心。之后，多视图信息压缩器将所有令牌信息归纳成聚类中心令牌（即CLiFTs）。在测试时，系统根据目标视图和计算预算，选择数量特定的邻近令牌，并使用自适应渲染器生成新视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV数据集上，实验结果表明该方法显著减少了数据量，在渲染质量相当的情况下取得了最高的整体渲染得分，同时实现了数据规模、渲染质量和渲染速度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的CLiFTs方法实现了计算高效的场景表示和新视图合成技术，在减少数据量的同时保持了高质量的渲染表现，适合在计算预算有限的环境中使用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Lumos-1的自回归视频生成器，避免了传统方法中的架构复杂性和高延迟问题，同时展现出较强的生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的自回归视频生成方法在架构设计上复杂或执行效率上存在问题，而作者试图设计一种高效且更易实现的生成器。

Method: 提出了基于3D RoPE的改进版MM-RoPE，并设计了适合时空数据的依赖关系策略与训练策略，如AR-DF；采用内存高效的训练方法进行模型预训练。

Result: 以仅48块GPU的预训练条件下，Lumos-1在多个基准测试上取得了与现有优秀模型相媲美的性能。

Conclusion: Lumos-1展示了如何通过少量架构改动及针对性改进提升自回归视频生成的效率和效果，为行业提供了新的方法论支持。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示的文本转语音模型，通过自然语言指令控制语音特性，并通过主成分分析与次级微调提高模型的可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本转语音模型存在受限的可控性和不可控的变异性问题，限制了用户对输出语音特性的灵活控制。

Method: 通过对大量合成样本进行主成分分析，提取主要影响输出变量的潜在特性，并将其作为新标签用于次级微调，从而提高文本到语音模型的可控性。

Result: 在对冰岛语语料库模型的测试中，提出的方法在没有情感标注的情况下提升了模型的连续和离散特性可控性。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型的不可控变异性，并结合主成分分析和微调方法，改进了文本转语音模型的语音特性控制。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Method: 提出MedicalBERT模型，基于大规模生物医学数据集进行预训练，并优化以适应命名实体识别、关系抽取、问答、句子相似性和文档分类等任务。

Result: MedicalBERT在大多数基准测试上表现优于BioBERT、SciBERT、ClinicalBERT等模型，平均相比普通BERT提高5.67%。

Conclusion: 证明了利用预训练BERT模型处理医学NLP任务的潜力，并展示了迁移学习技术在捕捉领域特定信息方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及，理解crack策略的复杂性和演化对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 通过分析超200万条多平台对话，作者使用了一系列复杂性指标（如概率性、词汇多样性、压缩比及认知负荷指标）对破解策略进行了大规模实证研究。

Result: 破解尝试的复杂性并未显著高于普通对话，该模式在专门的破解社区和普通用户群体中一致存在。尽管破解攻击的毒性和复杂性趋于稳定，但AI助手的响应毒性减少，表明安全机制有所改进。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，AI防守者与攻击者之间并非升级竞赛，而是受人类创造力限制，同时安全防护措施逐步提高。但先进的破解手段仍可能破坏这一区衡状态，带来潜在危险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域任务中的能力和局限性，以推动语言模型在该领域的进步。

Method: 使用金融特定数据集对FinGPT在六项自然语言处理任务中进行测试，包括情感分析、文本分类、命名实体识别、金融问答、文本摘要和股票走势预测。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强劲，如情感分析和新闻分类，但在涉及推理和生成的任务中表现较弱，与GPT-4和人类基准相比存在显著差距。

Conclusion: FinGPT对结构化金融任务有效，但仍需在推理和生成能力上进行优化，为今后的领域创新研究提供了基准并提出了改进需求。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型内部运作机理，挑战其仅依赖表面统计的观点，提出一种新的理论框架来分析机器理解。

Method: 通过提出三层次的机器理解观点（概念理解、状态世界理解、原则性理解），分析语言模型如何形成内部结构和理解机制；并探讨其与人类认知架构的不同。

Result: 大型语言模型能够形成功能上类似于人类理解的内部结构，但其“认知架构”与人类不同。

Conclusion: 研究建议应将讨论重点从“模型是否理解”转向“它们的独特思维运作方式”。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Motivation: 寻求一种能高效识别并修正文本生成模型错误的方法。

Method: 框架R3包含三个步骤：Review（通过PRM评分评估生成块质量）、Remask（对低评分块进一步蒙面）、Refine（集中改进低质量文本块）。

Result: 通过框架R3，可显著提升生成文本的最终质量，无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: R3框架为提高文本生成精度提供了一种高效而灵活的方案，适配性强，适用于现有的预训练模型。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是理解大型语言模型在关键现实场景（如招聘筛选）中的表现机制，评估其是否表现出一致性（信号）或随机性（噪声），以及其潜在应用价值。

Method: 利用受控数据集，测试了三种LLMs（Claude、GPT、Gemini）在不同背景（无公司、跨国公司初创企业、减少语境）下的简历筛选表现，并将其与三位人类招聘专家的评估进行对比。采用方差分析和配对t检验评估模型表现和适应性差异。

Result: 方差分析显示LLMs在四种条件下表现存在显著差异，且在所有情境中与人类评估有显著不同。配对t检验表明GPT对公司背景的适应性较强，Gemini适中，而Claude表现最低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管LLMs在提供可解释性模式和详细提示方面具有潜力，但其评估方式与人类判断存在显著分歧。这为其在自动化招聘系统中的应用提供了参考。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在诸多领域表现卓越，但其嵌入空间的安全风险，如对抗性攻击的威胁，尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过线性变换定位并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，形成ETTA框架，实现高效攻击，同时突破模型拒绝行为。

Result: 在五个开源LLM和AdvBench基准的测试中，ETTA的平均攻击成功率为88.61%，比最优基线高11.34%，并对增强型安全模型表现出良好的迁移能力（如指令调优防御模型ASR 77.39%）。

Conclusion: 现有的安全对齐策略在嵌入空间内存在显著弱点，迫切需要开发基于嵌入的防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

Conclusion: 自由倾向并非编程错误，而是民主权利导向话语的自然产物，可能提供了一种新的视角来审视集体推理。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

Motivation: 研究AI在招聘流程中的影响，特别是对效率和候选人选择的量化分析。

Method: 随机分配37000名申请者到传统招聘流程或带AI辅助的视频面试流程，对比不同流程的面试通过率和后续职业发展结果。

Result: AI辅助流程的最终面试通过率为54%，明显高于传统流程的34%；AI流程候选人五个月后的就业率也高于传统流程。

Conclusion: AI招聘提高了招聘效率但可能会偏爱年轻且资历较浅的候选人，对未来招聘决策具有重要影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了小型语言模型(SLMs)在心理健康理解中的能力，并与大型语言模型(LLMs)进行对比，结果显示SLMs在特定任务中接近LLMs的性能，且具备隐私保护优势和快速适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小型语言模型(SLMs)是否能在心理健康理解中提供与大型语言模型(LLMs)相当的性能，同时兼具隐私保护优势。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本学习范式，对五种最先进的SLMs与三种LLMs进行六项心理健康分类任务评估，比较其性能优劣。

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中性能接近LLMs（F1分数为0.64对比0.66），且少样本学习能显著提升SLMs表现（高达14.6%提升）；多分类严重性任务中两类模型均下降超过30%。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型在心理健康理解中表现出色，适合作为隐私保护的敏感数据分析工具，尤其在少样本学习下显示出快速适应和应用前景，可用作扩展性心理健康筛查工具。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种框架，以整合外部工具来改进大语言模型（LLMs）的查询性能，尤其在教育设置中，并显著提升其在数学和科学推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs在缺乏上下文信息时往往会产生低质量或虚假的回答，因此需要一种方法来增强LLMs的准确性和实用性，尤其是通过整合外部工具来提供最新数据和计算能力。

Method: 设计了一个框架，该框架通过访问外部API获取相关信息，并且支持诸如计算器或日历等计算功能。框架主要用于处理数学和科学推理问题。

Result: 在数学推理方面达到了83%的准确率，在科学推理上达到了88%的准确率，明显优于其他测试模型（包括GPT-4、LLaMA-Large等），其中表现最好的基线模型（LLaMA-Large）的对应准确率仅为67%和79%。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通过整合计算生态系统提升LLMs性能的潜力，为其自然融入各种任务和活动提供了可能性。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

*Deepali Mishra,Chaklam Silpasuwanchai,Ashutosh Modi,Madhumita Sushil,Sorayouth Chumnanvej*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统性审查了2018-2024年的68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的论文，并调查了印度和泰国的50位临床医生，以评估MedVQA的实用性和缺陷。研究发现目前的模型与临床需求之间存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在医疗工作流程中的实际效用以及当前存在的挑战和不足。

Method: 本文采用了双管齐下的方法：1) 审查相关研究以确定关键概念、进展和应用空白；2) 调查临床医生对MedVQA临床相关性的看法。

Result: 研究发现，目前的MedVQA数据集和模型在多视图、多分辨率影像支持、电子健康记录（EHR）集成和领域知识应用上存在不足；仅29.8%的医生认为MedVQA极为有用。临床医生提出的主要问题包括缺乏病人历史、数据集质量问题和多视图影像支持的缺失。

Conclusion: 尽管MedVQA技术潜力巨大，但要实现有效的临床整合，仍需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏病患上下文信息以及评估方法与临床需求不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了CRISP数据集，并证明经过CRISP微调的小模型可以生成比大型模型更高质量的规划，且优于链式推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要更强的推理能力，现有的链式推理方法已不足以应对这一需求，故研究探索更有效的高层次计划生成方法。

Method: 研究引入了CRISP数据集，其中高层次计划用于数学推理和代码生成，并通过LLM自动生成和验证。通过对小规模模型进行CRISP微调，以提升整体推理和任务完成能力。

Result: 微调后的小模型生成的计划质量优于大型模型的少次提示，并显著超过链式推理。此外，跨领域评估表明，某一领域的微调对其他领域的计划生成也有改善效果。

Conclusion: CRISP数据集和方法为增强模型复杂推理能力提出了有效路径，并显示了其跨领域的扩展性和适用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出AblationBench，一个用于评估自动化语言模型代理在AI研究中进行消融实验任务表现的基准测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过AI语言模型代理实现科学研究的部分支持或自动化的需求日益增加，尤其是进行消融实验的设计，这是实证AI研究的重要部分。

Method: 设计AblationBench，包括两个任务：AuthorAblation（帮助作者提出消融实验）和ReviewerAblation（帮助审稿人发现缺失的消融实验），并引入基于语言模型的自动评估框架。

Result: 现有最先进的语言模型系统在任务中表现仍显不足，平均仅能识别29%的原始消融项。同时，通过分析发现链式思维提示比现有的基于代理的方法表现更优。

Conclusion: AblationBench为评估AI代理在实证研究中的消融实验规划任务提供了一个有价值的工具，但现有语言模型在这些任务中仍面临显著挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种名为Krul的多轮对话LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升效率，同时保持高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在对话历史KV缓存压缩上采取固定策略，忽略了对话中不同层注意力模式的动态变化，导致效率低下和准确性下降。

Method: 引入Krul系统，其动态选择压缩策略，包括利用注意力相似性选择层对进行压缩、减少相似性计算存储开销的估计方法以及无气泡恢复调度器，并结合重新计算与加载流水线来优化KV缓存恢复。

Result: Krul在真实任务中实现了1.5x-2.68x时间到达第一标记（TTFT）的缩短，并减少了1.33x-2.35x的KV缓存存储，生成质量无明显下降。

Conclusion: Krul通过动态压缩与有效调度显著提升了多轮对话时LLM的推理效率，是一种在生成质量与性能之间取得平衡的前沿方法。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需额外训练即可生成高效正确的SPARQL查询，从而更好地回答自然语言或关键词问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型执行SPARQL查询以逐步探索知识图谱，包括比较不同检索方式、引入反馈机制和少量样本的使用。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到多项基准的最新水平，在Freebase上接近最佳结果，并在其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本条件下取得成功，证明其高效性与广泛适用性，同时提供了多种改进途径。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Conclusion: 此框架能增强语言模型在苛求透明和可审核领域的实用性，体现该技术在改善决策流程中的潜力。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Compactor的参数无关型KV缓存压缩方法，能够在保持性能的同时减少内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型对超大上下文的支持因KV缓存占用大量内存资源受到限制，亟需解决这一瓶颈问题。

Method: 通过引入基于近似杠杆分数的令牌重要性方法，实现一个无需依赖问题查询的KV缓存压缩策略，并提供适应上下文的压缩校准流程。

Result: 在各种合成和实际任务中，Compactor保持性能的同时减少了KV缓存内存占用，最高达63%。

Conclusion: Compactor展示了其高效性和通用性，为应对KV缓存内存瓶颈问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

Motivation: 当前小型语言模型(SLMs)被广泛应用于资源受限但交互频繁的领域，如智能手机，因此确保从LLMs到SLMs知识蒸馏过程中保留LLMs的同理心至关重要。

Method: 论文设计了两步微调流程，并利用从LLMs提取的同理心对话数据集，结合四种目标性提示，大幅提升了同理心蒸馏效果。

Result: 经过优化提示的两步微调后，SLMs在生成同理心回应时较原始SLMs表现出显著提升，胜率达90%，且比直接提示提高了10%的胜率。

Conclusion: 证明了通过优化提示和微调的知识蒸馏方法，可以有效保留和增强小型模型的同理心能力，适配资源受限应用场景。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Motivation: 为了解决生成型大语言模型产生不真实信息的问题，特别是在高风险场景中需要提高预测输出真实性的准确性。

Method: 引入 TruthTorchLM，一个整合了多种真实性预测方法的库，包括基于文档验证、不确定性的方法等。支持 HuggingFace 和 LiteLLM 接口，并且可拓展、灵活使用。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM 提供了一个多功能、开放的工具，用于研究和实践生成模型真实性预测问题，促进了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLMs）的超越分布泛化（即超范围推理，OOCR）现象，可能只是微调（fine-tuning）时加入了定向的“引导向量”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是解释为何微调后的大模型能够展现出OOCR，这种现象对于模型的部署安全性和可靠性至关重要。

Method: 通过分析微调机制，发现引导向量（steering vector）的加入是OOCR背后简单且主要的解释。作者还尝试从零直接训练引导向量来验证该机制。

Result: 发现引导向量的加入不仅提升了微调任务的表现，还对相关领域的泛化有显著效果，即便是需要条件行为的任务（如模型“后门”任务）也可通过非条件的引导向量实现。

Conclusion: 研究为OOCR现象提供了机械方面的解释，揭示了微调阶段对模型学习内容的影响，并为提升LLMs的安全可靠性提供了一些新思路。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the

behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究长期以来忽略了性别在疼痛体验中的作用，本研究旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用隐藏属性模型-卷积神经网络（HAM-CNN）进行自然语言分析，基于用户名分类帖子。

Result: 通过HAM-CNN模型分类，达到F1分值为0.86；发现女性语言更具情感特点，且女性更易患偏头痛和鼻窦炎，药物影响也存在性别差异。

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中扮演关键角色，研究为精准医学和个性化治疗提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KAT模型，一种开源的40B大语言模型，通过自动思维训练范式解决在推理密集型任务中的过度思考问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中的过度思考问题，同时提高模型效率与准确性。

Method: 开发了双模式数据集、基于多目标预测的知识蒸馏方法、冷启动初始化策略以及强化学习算法Step-SRPO，用于动力学选择推理和非推理模式。

Result: 实验表明，KAT模型在多个基准任务中与当前最好的模型表现相当甚至更优，同时减少标记使用量约30%。

Conclusion: KAT不仅在学术测试中表现优异，还成功应用于实际开发工作流程中，并展现出良好的扩展性。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了一种新颖的微调方法，同步自我审查（SSR），通过在生成翻译文本前生成OCR文本，显著改善了多模态大语言模型在OCR和文档图像翻译任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在文档图像翻译任务中表现不佳，特别是在同时处理跨模态和跨语言挑战时，还容易因微调丢失已有的单语能力（如OCR）。

Method: 提出同步自我审查（SSR）微调方法，先让模型生成OCR文本，借助已有的OCR能力，再进行翻译学习，从而减少遗忘并增强跨语言能力。

Result: 实验表明，SSR学习方法有效缓解了遗忘问题，提高了MLLM在OCR和文档图像翻译任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法验证了同步利用OCR能力和翻译学习的优势，为改进多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上的性能提供了新途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一种基于大语言模型的多代理系统，旨在改善电商商家在私域渠道中的文案创作与客户沟通效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数商家缺乏撰写有效文案的专业技能和可扩展工具，难以在私域客户关系管理中优化忠诚度和转化率。

Method: CRMAgent通过三种模式生成高质量信息模板：组群学习、检索与适配以及基于规则的回退机制。

Result: 实验显示，CRMAgent显著提升了质量和营销效果，超越了商家的原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent能在电商私域渠道中提高商家文案质量和客户互动效果，是一种高效实用的工具。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Motivation: 研究将专利内容转化为可行的产品创意，为专利开发提供实际应用价值的方法。

Method: 提出了MK2框架，通过Gemini 2.5编辑提示，结合GPT-4.1生成创意，以及Qwen3-8B参与Elo评估循环选择最佳提示，完成创意生成任务。

Result: 在三个领域的六个评价标准中，MK2在自动评分榜单中表现最佳，并在36次测试中赢得了25次，除了材料化学领域稍显不足。

Conclusion: 轻量化的提示设计能够高效地支持专利创意生成，展示了在领域特定任务中的潜在商业价值。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习与知识蒸馏两种训练文本重新排序器的方法，发现知识蒸馏在条件具备时效果更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在实际条件下，采用对比学习和知识蒸馏两种策略训练文本重新排序器的效果差异，为选择最优训练策略提供依据。

Method: 在相同数据上，通过分别采用对比学习和知识蒸馏训练不同规模与架构的模型，并以一个强大的对比学习模型作为知识蒸馏的教师模型，系统比较两种方法的效果。

Result: 知识蒸馏在教师模型较强大时，整体表现优于对比学习，无论是在域内还是域外任务上；但当教师模型与学生模型能力相近时，知识蒸馏的优势减弱，尤其在域外任务中。

Conclusion: 当有强大的教师模型时，优先采用知识蒸馏训练较小的重新排序器；否则，对比学习则是更可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在金融问答领域，提升LLMs和RLLMs性能的方法，发现现有方法对LLMs效果显著，但对RLLMs提升有限。


<details>

Motivation: 探索提高LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域性能的方法，特别是在复杂问题的推理能力方面的改进。

Method: 采用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs，研究各类提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法对金融问答任务的影响。

Result: 发现：(1) 现有提示和代理框架通过模拟长链式推理显著提升LLMs性能；(2) RLLMs的先天推理能力使传统方法难以进一步提升其性能；(3) 多语言对齐方法对延长推理长度有效，但对RLLMs增益有限。

Conclusion: 研究为在金融问答任务中应用LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考，指出现有方法对LLMs提升明显，但对RLLMs需要更深入的方法研究。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

TL;DR: 本文评估了自动生成任务的评价指标，包括n-gram和神经网络方法，提出不同语言的指标表现差异以及优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨自动生成任务的评价指标在不同语言和任务中的适用性，以解决这些指标在语言间的适用性不明确的问题。

Method: 设计了一个包含八种语言的评价测试，覆盖四种语言学类型，并分析指标与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 发现语言类型对评价指标敏感，如n-gram指标在融合型语言中相关性低，但在隔离型和黏着型语言中表现较好；适当分词可显著改进。神经网络指标如COMET在低资源语言中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: n-gram方法在特定语言中有局限性，建议加强针对评价任务训练的神经网络指标研究。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: 本研究为构建高效的多代理LLM系统提供了实用指导，展示了如何利用多样性和深度提升科学创意生成的质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型生成的文本容易出现事实性错误（即幻觉）。研究表明，与直接在高质量事实数据上微调相比，使用模型生成且模型认为是事实的数据进行微调，可能更有效减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在基于语言模型生成长文本的任务中，通过何种微调数据能有效减少幻觉的产生。

Method: 评估不同的数据微调策略，包括使用事实性数据、模型生成数据及基于模型判断过滤的数据，观察其在减少幻觉方面的效果。

Result: 发现使用模型生成并通过模型自身判断过滤的数据微调，可以比其他策略更显著提高结果的事实性。这种改进能够在不同领域间迁移。

Conclusion: 模型自身的信念可作为强大的事实性信号，在减少幻觉方面比直接使用高质量事实性数据更有效。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains
underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource

Result: 实验表明，与基线方法相比，逻辑泛化能力提高超过30%，同时保持编辑的可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持内部逻辑一致性的基础上，实现了知识编辑过程中的连锁效应最佳状态。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在模拟真实场景中的表现逐步提升，尤其在多智能体协作系统中表现优异，有必要探索其在模拟和优化复杂决策会议中的潜力。

Method: 通过六种不同的LLMs进行评估，完成立场检测（识别智能体对议题的态度）和情感倾向检测（判断正面、负面或中立情绪）；并将这些模型用于多智能体系统，检测其在复杂模拟中的表现。

Result: 研究表明，LLMs能够准确侦测动态、复杂辩论中的智能体间共识；结合共识检测功能的系统提升了小组讨论效率，结果质量和连贯性接近实际决策会议。

Conclusion: LLMs驱动的多智能体系统能够用于模拟群体决策过程，并在专家意见征集等领域展示出支持决策制定的潜力。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客户常用自然语言描述税务案例，这使得LLMs成为支持自动化决策和减轻税务咨询师工作负担的理想选择。

Method: 通过微调和RAG两种方法，对教科书案例和税务咨询公司真实案例进行实验分析，以系统地优化LLMs配置并评估其法律推理能力。

Result: 研究表明，适当配置的LLMs可有效支持税务专业人士处理VAT任务，并提供法律依据。但由于法律领域的敏感性，当前模型尚不适合全面自动化。

Conclusion: LLMs可部分自动化税务咨询任务，但其处理隐性知识和上下文特定文件的能力仍有限，需进一步集成结构化背景信息技术。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Conclusion: LLaPa框架通过改进多模态程序规划和反事实推理能力，显著提升了模型的性能，是当前领域的一种重要进展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

Method: 使用大语言模型引导的主题聚类来初始化LDA模型的吉布斯采样算法，并将LLM用于后期校正，加强主题建模的效果。

Result: 发现LLMs改进的初始化策略对LDA早期迭代有帮助，但对于收敛无效且结果较差，而后期校正阶段带来了5.86%的连贯性提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将LLMs集成到主题建模中存在实际应用优势，但也挑战了大语言模型在文本挖掘中始终优于传统方法的普遍认知。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

Result: 该方法在五个基准测试上证明了其知识动态融合性能的可比性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在测试时实现实时知识融合，无需更新模型参数，提升了适应性与实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Conclusion: 与现有方法相比，单次cache steering具备超参数稳定性高、推理效率高、易整合等优点，因此是一种更稳健实用的生成控制方法。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Motivation: 为了解决真实世界表格数据中存在的大规模、不完整的列语义和实体模糊问题，设计一个高效处理和理解表格数据的系统框架。

Method: 提出了一种结合结构化和语义化表示的表格建模方法，并采用多步骤架构链接计划提取相关信息，同时集成迭代思考架构以完成推理任务。

Result: 系统在SemEval-2025 Task 8两项子任务中均获得第一名的成绩。

Conclusion: TableReasoner系统展现了强大的表格推理能力，为处理复杂表格问答任务提供了一种高效和准确的方法。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨大语言模型（LLMs）面临的越狱问题，提出一种动态斯塔克尔伯格博弈框架模型，并通过新方法 Purple Agent 来应对挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在关键应用中的广泛部署，其安全机制被攻击者绕过（即越狱）的问题逐渐成为重大挑战。

Method: 通过动态斯塔克尔伯格博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为顺序扩展形式博弈，并提出Purple Agent：结合快速探索随机树（RRT）的对抗性探索与防御策略方法。

Result: Purple Agent 能积极模拟潜在攻击路径，并进行主动干预以预防有害输出，从而有效应对越狱风险。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析对抗性动态提供了系统化视角，并为缓解越狱风险提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Motivation: 为了研究在有限理性条件下，通过显式建模推理过程来研究认知约束、心态表现及知识学习。

Method: 定义在提示空间上的推理均衡，分析行为作为LLM推理的产出，并通过实例展示其对比经典Nash结果的差异。

Result: 展示了该框架能够揭示经典Nash结果的偏离及其对LLM支持系统的战略交互影响。

Conclusion: 提供了研究LLM系统中战略交互的新基础，突出了推理提示和有限理性的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了智能体如何在探索世界与控制环境之间取得平衡，并提出了一种将内在动机理论与强化学习相结合的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索智能体如何平衡好奇心（追求知识）与能力（掌控环境）的驱动因素。

Method: 利用两种模型化的智能体（Tabular和Dreamer），对比使用手工构建的状态抽象与自主学习的内部世界模型的效果，同时分析探索与表示学习之间的交互。

Result: Tabular智能体中，好奇心与能力在探索中表现出不同模式，优先兼顾两者可改进探索；Dreamer智能体揭示了探索与表示学习之间的双向交互，类似于好奇与能力协同进化的过程。

Conclusion: 将适应性探索形式化为在追求未知与可控之间的平衡，为认知理论及高效强化学习提供了新见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [131] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种参数化的逻辑落地方法族，可以平衡逻辑推理的表达能力和可扩展性，并展示了选择合适落地标准的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeSy方法面临表达能力和计算可扩展性的矛盾：全面的逻辑落地导致组合爆炸，而基于启发式的选择推导缺乏理论依据且不保证信息完整性。

Method: 从多跳符号推理中汲取灵感，提出一种参数化的逻辑落地方法家族，推广了经典的反向链式推理，可以根据选择调整表达能力与计算效率之间的平衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，选择合适的逻辑落地准则对NeSy方法的性能具有显著影响。

Conclusion: 逻辑落地准则的选择对NeSy方法的效率和能力至关重要，参数化方法为此提供了灵活控制的框架。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种多模态量子联邦学习（QFL）方法，并通过量子纠缠实现中间融合，同时引入一种缺失模态无关机制（MMA）以保障训练的稳定性，其性能在不同数据分布中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子联邦学习（QFL）框架主要集中于单模态系统，限制了其在涉及多模态任务的实际应用场景中的适用性，因此需要一种针对多模态QFL的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种多模态量子联邦学习方法，通过量子纠缠实现多模态的中间融合；引入缺失模态无关（MMA）机制，该机制隔离未训练的量子电路，避免因缺失模态导致的状态损坏。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在IID数据分布和非IID数据分布中的准确性分别提升了6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 该研究在量子联邦学习领域引入了多模态支持，并通过MMA机制明显提高了模型的训练稳定性与性能，对多模态任务的处理提供了创新性的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在科学、设计等领域如何被讨论，并分析其在计算系统中的实际应用。

Method: 对溯因推理的理论背景和计算系统实施进行解析，分解各计算系统的组件，对其表现进行评估。

Result: 发现目前的理论框架和计算系统无法很好地支持创造性溯因假设的生成，计算方法主要集中在三段论形式的推理上。

Conclusion: 现有研究存在空白领域，需在理论与实践上探索新方法以促进创造性溯因推理的发展。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有工具和功能执行能力的自主LLM代理面临的新型安全威胁。

Method: 通过三模态分类法（区分良性、恶意和敏感的用户提示及工具反应）以及基于策略的决策模型，结合沙盒环境强化学习来实现安全对齐框架。

Result: 通过实验，验证了框架能有效提高安全性，同时保持在良性任务中的高效表现。

Conclusion: 该框架制定了自动化LLM代理的可信应用基础，结合安全与任务效用的优化。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Motivation: 现有多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在动态空间交互处理方面能力不足，而这一点在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据生成管道和动态多任务训练策略，结合精心设计的数据样本和分步优化方法，以解决数据间冲突和提供任务特定奖励信号。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在通用与空间推理领域表现优越，在8个基准中达到新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 通过改进数据生成与训练方法，M2-Reasoning-7B显著提升了推理能力，填补了动态空间交互处理的能力空白。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Motivation: 传统的伦理需求获取需要大量多方参与，受时间和资源限制且优先级较低。本研究旨在通过自动化方式简化伦理需求获取过程。

Method: 引入一个多代理大语言模型中的伦理倡导代理，通过批判和提出系统描述中的伦理问题，从而生成伦理需求草案。

Result: 在两个案例研究中，框架捕捉到大部分伦理需求，并发现部分新增需求，但在生成可靠性方面存在问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明该框架在伦理需求获取中具有推动作用，但仍需借助人类反馈提高其可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Motivation: 解决自然语言到正式逻辑表示的映射问题，推动人工智能在处理非结构化语言输入时的推理能力。

Method: 引入双层框架，分为高层任务抽象（解析问题类型、目标、变量和约束）和低层逻辑生成（生成符号化工作流或可执行推理程序），并通过端到端优化同时改进这两个阶段。

Result: 在多个现实推理基准上取得显著的性能提升，准确性相比基线算法提升高达40%。

Conclusion: 双层设计不仅提高了性能，还增强了推理的透明性和错误追踪能力，推动了LLM在可信和系统化推理上的应用。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

*Soheyl Massoudi,Mark Fuge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多智能体系统（MAS）是否能比简单的两智能体系统（2AS）更有效地执行需求提取、功能分解和模拟代码生成任务。研究目标为太阳能净水系统，采用了Design-State Graph（DSG）的设计方法，并进行了多种实验对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决早期工程设计中的复杂和迭代性问题，同时克服现有大语言模型(LMM)在任务延续性和可执行模型生成方面的不足。

Method: 引入一个九角色多智能体系统（MAS）和一个简化的两智能体系统（2AS），并设计了基于目标应用的设计状态图（DSG）。实验中使用两个模型（Llama 3.3 70B与DeepSeek R1 70B）、多种温度和种子，测试要求覆盖率、代码兼容性、完成率等指标。

Result: MAS在设计细节粒度上有更好的表现（平均5-6个DSG节点），而2AS则倾向于模式压缩。两种系统均维持了JSON完整性和实现标注，但需求覆盖率均低于20%，代码兼容性和要求标注的完整性仍有不足。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统在设计细节方面的改进显著，推理精炼的语言模型有效提高了完成率，但需求覆盖率和代码保真度仍需提升。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高形式化定理证明中大语言模型的推理性能。

Method: 通过强化学习及 Lean 4 验证器反馈改进推理，采用多轮验证交互、反馈遮蔽机制和简单奖励策略。

Result: 在 MiniF2F 测试集上，相较于基线模型性能，有 2.0% 到 3.2% 的 pass@128 提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合验证器反馈显著改善了模型推理的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

### [145] [Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08664)
*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的AI代理推理框架——Introspection of Thought (INoT)，通过促使LLM在提示中执行编码化的对话推理，并减少推理过程中的令牌成本，以改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI代理在利用LLM进行推理时，受到自然语言理解的局限性和高推理成本的限制。

Method: 引入一种新的LLM-Read编码提示，将自我反思过程设计在LLM内部，从而改善推理效果并降低成本。

Result: 六个基准测试上的实验表明，性能平均提高了7.95%，同时令牌成本比最好的基线方法降低了58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架有效提升了AI代理的推理能力和成本效率，展示了其在文本和图像任务中的多样性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

setup requirements. We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text
input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.
Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a
reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to
accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to
enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合差分隐私和少样本学习的联邦学习框架，用于解决呼吸道疾病诊断中的有限标签和隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据注释耗时费力，特别是在资源有限的环境中，高质量标注数据稀缺。同时，患者隐私问题限制了跨机构间的医疗数据共享。

Method: 提出了隐私保护的联邦少样本学习框架，通过元随机梯度下降算法缓解过拟合问题，并结合差分隐私噪声保护医疗数据隐私，采用加权平均算法聚合不同客户端的诊断模型。

Result: 该方法在呼吸道疾病诊断中表现优异，能有效处理不同结构、类别和分布的数据，同时实现隐私保护。

Conclusion: 通过该框架可实现兼顾数据隐私与诊断效果的医疗数据处理，为呼吸道疾病诊断提供了新途径。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的TPE算法，用于高效地解决组合优化问题，并在合成实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TPE算法主要应用于DL领域的超参数优化，但在化学和生物等领域的组合优化需求中，尚未得到有效研究。

Method: 通过将数值核推广到分类核，引入距离结构，并修改核以处理大型组合搜索空间，从而提高TPE在组合优化中的效率。

Result: 改进的TPE方法在合成实验中表现出优异性能，能以更少的评估次数找到更优解。

Conclusion: 提出的方法扩大了TPE的应用范围，特别是在非深度学习领域，并被集成到开源框架Optuna中以支持实际应用。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

TL;DR: 提出了Quantile Reward Policy Optimization (QRPO) 方法，可在离线数据上进行点位绝对奖励对齐，与现有方法DPO、REBEL相比表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目前需要在线或策略内算法（如PPO、GRPO）进行点位绝对奖励对齐的问题，同时克服DPO和REBEL方法只能从相对信号中学习的限制。

Method: 提出QRPO方法，其利用分位点奖励进行回归，操作简单，适合离线应用。奖励函数通过分位点计算，避免了相对信号对分割函数的依赖，并能够通过增加计算扩展性来提升性能。

Result: 在聊天和编码评估（如奖励模型评分、AlpacaEval 2 和 LeetCode）中，QRPO在多个数据集和8B规模模型上的表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO。

Conclusion: QRPO提供了一个简洁、高效的框架，摆脱了在线学习的限制，对于奖励模型评分等应用表现出更优效果，并减少了长度偏差问题。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

Result: 因果模型能够提供异常的早期预警信号和根因归属，有效解决黑箱方法的缺陷，并展示了在水处理等系统中的成功应用。

Conclusion: 因果学习为时空异常检测提供了新的研究视角，未来需重点探索多模态、生成式AI驱动和可扩展自适应因果框架，以应对复杂互联基础设施中的动态威胁。

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有微调方法在内存消耗和优化表现间的平衡问题，尤其针对需要高内存的AdamW等优化器。

Method: 引入Momentum Factorized SGD（MoFaSGD），通过动态低秩SVD表示优化一阶动量，并采用谱归一更新方法替代子空间动量累积。

Result: MoFaSGD在大语言模型的对齐基准测试中表现良好，内存消耗类似于LoRA，同时性能媲美当前最优低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD提供了一种记忆高效且性能优异的优化方法，证明其在非凸随机优化中达到最优收敛率，并公开了实现代码。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

Motivation: 解决标准优化器在处理刚性或病态PDE系统时的梯度不平衡问题。

Method: 设计了一种基于每个样本PDE残差梯度的方差调整参数更新的优化器，称为PDE感知优化器，并与现有优化器Adam和SOAP进行对比。

Result: PDE感知优化器在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程的优化中，表现出更平稳的收敛过程和更低的绝对误差，尤其是在存在尖锐梯度的区域。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知适配方法在提升PINNs训练稳定性方面表现优异，但未来研究需探索在更大模型结构和硬件加速器上的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs无法严格满足约束条件，工程系统中的约束违背可能严重影响模型预测可靠性。

Method: 通过求解最小距离问题的KKT条件进行投影，使用对数指数转换将非线性KKT条件重构为稀疏线性与指数项系统，实现约束条件的可微分投影。

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了一种将领域知识融入机器学习的方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3
hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model
yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in
large-scale urban risk prediction. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: Text-LENS模型能有效评估学生能力并推广到新题目，展现了其在教育评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Motivation: 开发一种隐私更友好的情绪识别方法，以帮助有沟通障碍的人群，如阿尔茨海默病患者和创伤后应激障碍的退伍军人。

Method: 通过比较经典机器学习算法和基于量子内核的混合量子机器学习方法，训练和测试基于生理信号的情绪分类模型。

Conclusion: 结合可穿戴传感器数据和量子机器学习的方法，可提高情绪识别的准确性和鲁棒性，为临床和助住环境中的被动情绪监控奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living
conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 此论文提出了一个名为CTRLS的框架，通过分布式强化学习的方法改进大语言模型(LLMs)在链式推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式推理（CoT）方法缺乏系统建模的能力，使得模型难以有效探索推理路径。为解决这一问题，作者提出将这一过程转化为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行优化。

Method: 采用分布式强化学习，将推理动作建模为隐空间中的概率分布，并利用一种基于epsilon贪婪探索和熵正则化的策略优化隐状态转换，无需对LLM进行额外微调。

Result: 实验表明，在多个推理任务基准上，新方法提升了推理的准确性、多样性以及探索效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的CTRLS框架为链式推理提供了一种基于理论分析支持的全面框架，显著提高了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于进化算法的攻击方法（EvA），旨在直接解决离散优化问题，从而有效降低图神经网络在图结构发生细微扰动时的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对GNN的攻击方法大多依赖梯度信息进行边的扰动，这种方式虽然简化了优化问题但带来了适应性和性能的局限。

Method: 提出了基于改进的进化算法的攻击方法EgA，能够直接处理离散优化问题，无需针对不可微目标函数设计可微损失代理。

Result: 实验结果表明，EvA相比于最好的已有攻击方法，平均多降低约11%的准确性，并能设计出两种新型攻击方法，显著减少稳健性证书的有效性与突破一致性集。

Conclusion: EvA方法挖掘了攻击设计中的潜力，为基于非渐进方法的攻击研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Result: 在Google与Berkeley的实际数据上测试，结合因果发现和自然语言生成的方案提升了解释能耗异常的能力。

Conclusion: InsightBuild能够有效帮助管理者诊断并解决能耗问题。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Conclusion: CoreSPECT框架有效增强了传统聚类算法的性能，并展示出对噪声的鲁棒性和理论上的保障。

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于缺失数据对机器学习模型性能造成的严重影响。传统方法因无法有效处理复杂非线性相关性问题，特别是在有数值、类别和文本数据混合的场景而受到限制。

Method: 设计利用量子特性（如叠加和纠缠）的Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) 量子电路生成的量子特征映射，替代传统的经典嵌入方法，并将其与大型语言模型结合以改进缺失值填充性能。

Result: 在基准混合类型数据集上的实验结果表明，Quantum-UnIMP可以将数值特征的填充值误差降低至多15.2%（以RMSE衡量），类别特征的分类准确率提高8.7%（以F1-Score衡量），优于现有经典和LLM方法。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了量子增强的特征表示在解决复杂数据填充任务中的潜力，即使是使用目前的近端量子硬件。

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Method: 提出了一种新自动化管道，结合机器学习和大语言模型，并新增了带32个平行网关的标注数据以改进平行结构的识别。

Result: 方法表现出较好的重建准确性，为加速BPMN模型创建提供了基础。

Conclusion: 通过自动化的文本到BPMN模型转换，显著提升了效率及模型能力，尤其在平行结构识别方面。

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Motivation: 前车的车道变换对自动驾驶车辆的运动规划影响很大，预测车道变换有助于提高道路安全和效率。现有研究缺乏对时段内行为预测及不同模型比较的研究。

Method: 使用高D数据集设计并实现LSTM、CNN和Transformer网络，测试不同输入配置下的车道变换预测准确性，比较三者性能。

Conclusion: 实验表明，Transformer网络较其他方法更适合车道变换预测，尤其对于考虑精度与召回率的应用场景。

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Method: 提出了一种新的基于边界点的两聚类检验方法，可以通过分析边界点得到更准确的p值，从而更好地判断两个子集是否属于同一聚类。

Conclusion: 作者提出的两聚类检验方法不仅降低了误差，还证明了其在实际聚类分析中的应用价值。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Motivation: 随机电报噪声（RTN）对纳米电子器件的可靠性和性能有显著影响，现有分析方法存在限制，难以处理复杂、噪声较高的数据集。因此需要开发一种通用的、自动化的方法来分析RTN信号。

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base

Conclusion: 新方法显著减少了解释生成的干扰，改善了可解释性评估的可靠性，为稀疏编码器的评价提供了更透明的框架。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

Conclusion: SynBridge通过结合离散空间的结构扩散机制显著提升了化学反应预测的效果，展示了其在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Conclusion: SFedKD框架能够有效应对顺序联邦学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并提高模型训练效率与知识覆盖。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种通过选择合适的奖励聚合函数来替代修改奖励函数以实现灵活行为对齐的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在强化学习中，为了使代理的行为符合特定目标，通常需要精心设计奖励函数，但当目标复杂时，这一过程具有挑战性。

Method: 提出一个基于代数视角的马克夫决策过程（MDP）框架，引入奖励的递归生成和聚合，从而推广标准的折扣求和到其他递归聚合方式，如折扣最大值和夏普比率，并将其与价值函数算法和演员-评论算法无缝集成。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在优化多样化目标上有高效表现，突出了其实用性和应用潜力。

Conclusion: 通过该新方法能有效优化多样目标，为实现实际应用中的灵活行为对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于transformers和专家混合的深度学习框架CircFormerMoE，用于直接从植物基因组DNA预测环状RNA（circRNA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的circRNA鉴定方法无法直接从基因组DNA预测，依赖RNA实验数据且计算成本高，尤其是植物中的环状RNA预测更具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种由两个子任务（剪接位点检测和剪接位点配对）组成的深度学习框架CircFormerMoE，基于transformers和专家混合模型开发而成。

Result: 模型在10种植物的数据上验证了其有效性，不仅能够预测已知的circRNA，还能发现未注释的circRNA。

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的方法和工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了周围车辆不确定或激进行为带来的潜在风险，因此，需要一种能够综合考虑这种风险的轨迹预测方法。

Method: 设计了一个时空风险感知的轨迹预测框架，包括一个时空编码器和风险感知特征融合解码器，并引入风险缩放损失函数以提升高风险场景下预测的准确性。

Result: 在NGSIM和HighD数据集上验证，分别将平均预测误差降低了4.8%和31.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了高风险场景的预测精度，还为自动驾驶系统提供了可解释性和风险感知功能，促进决策的稳健性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: AbbIE是一种递归的Transformer编码器架构，性能超过标准Transformer，在动态计算资源调整和任务复杂性适应方面表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望在无需特殊数据集和训练协议的情况下，通过动态调整计算资源改进Transformer的性能，同时解决扩展任务复杂度的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为AbbIE的递归通用Transformer构架，允许在潜在空间中进行迭代操作，同时支持任务复杂性驱动的动态计算扩展。

Result: AbbIE仅用两次训练迭代即实现向上泛化，在零样本上下文学习任务中性能提升达12%，语言困惑度降低5%。

Conclusion: AbbIE展现了通过递归编码器对Transformer性能进行动态扩展的新潜力，且无需特殊数据或协议即能适应复杂任务。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Motivation: 现有的恶意软件分类模型性能受概念漂移影响显著，而适应数据分布变化通常需要大量标注，十分昂贵。

Method: 提出了一种模型无关的伪标签半监督学习方法ADAPT，可应用于神经网络和基于树的算法等，最大程度利用未标注数据以减少标注需求。

Result: 在五个不同的恶意软件检测数据集上进行测试，涵盖Android、Windows、PDF领域。结果显示，ADAPT在性能上明显优于基线模型和现有对比模型。

Conclusion: ADAPT算法为解决恶意软件检测中的概念漂移问题提供了更高效的解决方案，提升了模型的适应能力。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

TL;DR: 本研究通过卫星遥感技术监测印度旁遮普地区大规模水资源管理，可精确区分不同种植方式，并为政策制定提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球水资源短缺、稻田耗水量高需要可持续灌溉方法，但缺乏这些方法采用率的相关数据阻碍了基于证据的政策制定。

Method: 通过联合PRANA项目收集稻田管理的地面数据，利用Sentinel-1卫星图像开发分类系统，区分直接播种稻（DSR）与传统移栽稻的水管理方法。

Result: 该方法具有78%的F1-score准确度，可扩展至约300万农业地块的DSR采用监测，与政府记录的相关性强（Pearson=0.77）。

Conclusion: 这项研究为政策制定者提供了一种有效工具，以大规模跟踪可持续水资源管理的采用情况，优化干预措施和评估项目影响。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型已使用所有标注数据集进行训练，图像描述性能提升遇到瓶颈，需探索无监督图像描述方法。

Method: 提出LoGIC方法，利用多智能体强化学习，包括‘说话者’和‘听者’两个智能体，在自然语言交流中优化协作策略，基于GRPO算法进行训练。

Result: 在无额外标签的情况下，LoGIC方法达到46 BLEU分数，比基础VLM提升2分；在轻量模型配置下（使用ViT和GPT2），无监督设定中达到31 BLEU分数，比现有方法高10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC通过创新的无监督学习框架，在图像描述任务中实现了显著性能提升，并展示了轻量模型的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedAKD的新方法应对联邦学习中的协作公平性问题，特别是在不平衡协变量漂移的情境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决现有方法忽略的复杂异质性问题，尤其是数据分布不平衡导致的协作不公平。

Method: 提出了一种简单而有效的FedAKD方法，包括客户端和服务器端的更新流程，并利用不平衡协变量漂移的分析结果引入异步知识蒸馏策略。

Result: 通过理论证明了FedAKD方法的收敛性，并在FashionMNIST、CIFAR10及真实电子健康记录数据集上验证了其在提高协作公平性、预测准确性和客户参与度方面的显著效果。

Conclusion: FedAKD是一种可改善联邦学习中的协作公平性的新方法，尤其适用于高度异构数据分布的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WERSA（Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention）机制，可以以线性时间复杂度完成长序列处理，大幅提高效率并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer模型在处理长序列时存在计算成本高的问题，因为其注意力机制具有二次复杂度。

Method: WERSA结合内容自适应的随机谱特征、多分辨率的Haar小波及可学习参数，选择性地关注信息丰富的尺度，同时保持线性计算效率。

Result: WERSA在多个基准上表现出优越性，与其他注意力机制相比，获得了一致的精度提升。例如，在ArXiv-128k数据集上实现了79.1%的最佳准确率，并且速度是次优竞争者的两倍。

Conclusion: WERSA显著减少了计算负担，同时保持了高准确性，使得在低资源硬件上实现更实用、更可持续的长上下文模型成为可能。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Motivation: 深度学习理论认为模型容量增大应导致过拟合，但实践中却很少出现，这引发了对实际过拟合形式的探索。

Method: 提出了一种新评分方法评估验证集数据中的局部过拟合，通过模型训练历史实施两阶段方案：1）从检查点集成推导模型，2）蒸馏为单一模型以提升效能。

Result: 所提方法在多个数据集、现代架构与训练方案中的实验验证表现出色，特别是在带有标签噪声时优于原模型和独立训练的集成模型。

Conclusion: 该方法以较低的训练与推断复杂度实现了性能提升，可应对局部过拟合问题，为深度学习网络优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Conclusion: SPLASH方法证明了其在解决次优演示下的复杂、长时、对抗性任务中的优势，推动了机器人实际应用的发展。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Motivation: PMD理论研究较为充分，但其在实际中的表现和两种正则化方法的协作关系尚未得到全面分析。

Method: 通过超过50万个训练种子的大量实验，对小型强化学习环境中PMD的两种正则化方法（距离正则和MDP正则）进行检验和组合分析。

Result: 研究发现，两种正则化方法在一定程度上可以互相替代，但其具体组合对实现鲁棒性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究指出PMD算法中正则化技术组合的重要性，并为未来开发更鲁棒的强化学习算法提供了方向，尤其是在超参数选择的敏感性方面需加深研究。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时适配可以延长模型的寿命，但其效果是短暂的，模型最终可能失效。需要一种方法检测模型何时达到失败点并需要下线重训。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

*Idan Mashiach,Oren Glickman,Tom Tirer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，通过在最终训练阶段跟踪参数活动来缓解深度学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在学习新任务时，由于知识覆盖会丧失对之前任务的记忆能力。本文旨在通过优化和识别重要参数以减少此问题，同时提升新任务的表现。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的观点，仅在训练过程的最后阶段（训练平台期）跟踪参数的活动性，而不是全程监控，以识别能够同时保持旧知识和适应新任务的方向。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效平衡了灾难性遗忘的缓解和新学任务的性能之间的权衡，具有显著优越性。

Conclusion: 在深度学习中，抓住训练后期参数的高活动性区域，可以在减轻遗忘的同时提高新任务学习表现，这种方法提供了全新的启示。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过结合延迟嵌入线性输入和可学习的MLP特征，提出一种新的适应性NVAR模型，克服了传统NVAR在高噪声和高维度数据中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NVAR和RC在处理高噪声或实际数据时缺乏适应性，且在高维度情况下计算成本较高，因此需要开发更高效、更可扩展的方法。

Method: 设计了一种结合延迟嵌入线性输入与浅层可学习MLP特征的适应性NVAR模型，使用梯度优化共同训练MLP和线性读出层，并优化超参数设置以提高可扩展性。

Result: 在无噪声和合成噪声条件下测试时，新模型展现出比标准NVAR更高的预测精度，并在低观察频率情况下表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合数据驱动非线性和简单读出结构的新模型，在处理高噪声和实际数据条件下显示了对传统NVAR的重要改进，并具备更好的扩展性。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Motivation: 旨在克服经典 FNO 对于高维和复杂方程求解的局限性，结合量子计算和经典计算的优势。

Method: 提出一种量子与经典的混合分区计算方法，结合消息传递框架和变分优化，并使用 PennyLane 和 PyTorch 实现对不同方程的评估。

Result: PHQFNO 在经典 FNO 准确性的基础上提供了更高的精度，特别是在 Navier-Stokes 方程中表现优秀，并展现了更强的噪声抗性。

Conclusion: PHQFNO 在科学机器学习中展示了显著的潜力，有望成为处理复杂科学计算问题的有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型MoE架构BlockFFN，解决了传统激活稀疏性模型的计算瓶颈问题，同时改进了模型的加速性能和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型中的计算开销问题，研究者关注激活稀疏性架构（如MoE）。但传统MoE的路由方式性能较差，且在多token情况下稀疏性不足，难以适用于低资源环境和主流加速技术。

Method: 设计了一种新的MoE架构BlockFFN，利用融合ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由方式实现可微分和灵活路由，同时引入面向token级和chunk级稀疏性的训练目标。此外，开发了结合激活稀疏性和投机解码的高效加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在实验中展现出优越性能，达到了超过80%的token级稀疏性(TLS)和70%的8-token chunk级稀疏性(CLS)。在真实设备上的加速效果最高达3.67倍。

Conclusion: BlockFFN在提升性能和稀疏性方面相较于现有MoE方法具备显著优势，同时开发的内核具有实际加速能力，适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种离散时间条件高斯Koopman网络（CGKN），用于对高维复杂动力系统进行高效状态预测和数据同化（DA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决非线性部分观测系统建模的挑战，作者采用Koopman嵌入，找到未观测系统状态的合适潜在表示，为科学机器学习（SciML）和数据同化统一提供了新框架。

Method: 该网络通过条件线性动力学处理观测和未观测状态，利用Koopman嵌入构建潜在状态的线性条件高斯系统，利用解析公式高效计算潜在状态和整合DA性能到学习过程。

Result: 在非线性PDE案例如粘性Burgers'方程, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程与二维Navier-Stokes方程中，CGKN表现出与SciML先进方法相当的预测性能，同时展示高效准确的数据同化能力。

Conclusion: 离散时间CGKN框架不仅支持高效预测与数据同化，还能统一SciML开发与外环应用（如优化控制和逆问题求解）。

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Conclusion: 需要开发更可靠的生成语言模型评估方法，此研究的新训练模型提供了实际的解决方案并证明了效果显着。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We

Motivation: 现有符号加速器在处理大规模数据时受制于内存和路由复杂度，存在可扩展性问题。

Method: 通过随机森林分类器，根据边得分和结构特征裁剪低影响的转换，简化NFA图，同时保留语义正确性。

Result: 在FPGA上，其实现的LUT使用减少了高达40%，转换数减少了超30%，并能处理比现有基准数据集规模大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim有效降低了硬件资源消耗，解决了硬件互连的资源膨胀问题，具备良好扩展性。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

Method: 使用奖励缩放结合层归一化（RS-LN）和对不可行动作的惩罚机制（PA），引导数据范围外Q值的下降，进而开发PARS算法。

Result: PARS在D4RL基准任务中表现优异，尤其在AntMaze Ultra任务中，离线和在线训练性能均超越现有算法。

Conclusion: 通过PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推误差，显著提升了离线强化学习任务的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式优化因通信开销问题成为信号处理与机器学习中的瓶颈，而低秩梯度压缩是一个有效的解决途径。如何在保证收敛性的同时压缩数据是一个挑战。

Method: 引入GreedyLore方法，通过贪婪压缩结合误差反馈，修正贪婪压缩引入的偏差，并使用半惰性子空间更新确保操作的压缩性，理论证明其收敛率。

Result: 方法在标准优化器如MSGD和Adam下证明可达到线性加速的收敛率，并通过大量实验验证其理论结果。

Conclusion: GreedyLore克服了现有低秩压缩方法的不足，以可靠的理论支持优化了分布式学习的通信效率。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Motivation: 现有风险规避方法的保守探索，可能导致次优策略或目标失败的风险。

Method: 提出了ORAC方法，通过最大化奖励价值的局部上置信界并最小化成本价值的局部下置信界，促进探索高奖励状态，同时动态调整风险权重以满足安全约束。

Result: 实验证明了ORAC在连续控制任务中显著提高了奖励与成本的平衡效果。

Conclusion: ORAC能够避免次优策略的收敛，并改善风险约束环境中的性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了因果抽象的概念，特别是在去掉线性限制的情况下，发现这种因果抽象变得无意义且无法提供信息。


<details>

Motivation: 因果抽象被用来解释机器学习模型的决策过程，但现有研究多假设线性映射函数。本文旨在研究去掉线性约束后因果抽象是否仍有意义。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究非线性映射函数的因果抽象以及其在任务中的表现，如分析随机初始化语言模型的例子。

Result: 证明了在合理假设下，任何神经网络都能映射到任意算法，并通过实验展示即使模型无法完成任务，非线性映射也能实现100%准确性。

Conclusion: 去掉线性约束后，因果抽象方法失去意义，因为无法平衡映射的复杂性和准确性。因此，因果抽象不足以实现机械可解释性，还需进一步研究信息编码的假设。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Conclusion: NeurOptimiser展示了在实时、低能耗和去中心化优化领域利用脉冲原生算法的潜力，为神经形态计算开辟了新的应用方向。

Abstract: The increasing energy footprint of artificial intelligence systems urges
alternative computational models that are both efficient and scalable.
Neuromorphic Computing (NC) addresses this challenge by empowering event-driven
algorithms that operate with minimal power requirements through biologically
inspired spiking dynamics. We present the NeurOptimiser, a fully spike-based
optimisation framework that materialises the neuromorphic-based metaheuristic
paradigm through a decentralised NC system. The proposed approach comprises a
population of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units (NHUs), each combining spiking
neuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve
candidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimiser's coordination arises
through native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local
information sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration.
We implement this framework on Intel's Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2
chip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We
deploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly
considering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking
neural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for
spike-triggered heuristics. Although these configurations are implemented as a
proof of concept, we document and outline further extensions and improvements
to the framework implementation. Results show that the proposed approach
exhibits structured population dynamics, consistent convergence, and
milliwatt-level power feasibility. They also position spike-native MHs as a
viable path toward real-time, low-energy, and decentralised optimisation.

Abstract: Parameter control and dynamic algorithm configuration study how to
dynamically choose suitable configurations of a parametrized algorithm during
the optimization process. Despite being an intensively researched topic in
evolutionary computation, optimal control policies are known only for very few
cases, limiting the development of automated approaches to achieve them.
  With this work we propose four new benchmarks for which we derive optimal or
close-to-optimal control policies. More precisely, we consider the optimization
of the \LeadingOnes function via RLS$_{k}$, a local search algorithm allowing
for a dynamic choice of the mutation strength $k$. The benchmarks differ in
which information the algorithm can exploit to set its parameters and to select
offspring. In existing running time results, the exploitable information is
typically limited to the quality of the current-best solution. In this work, we
consider how additional information about the current state of the algorithm
can help to make better choices of parameters, and how these choices affect the
performance. Namely, we allow the algorithm to use information about the
current \OneMax value, and we find that it allows much better parameter
choices, especially in marginal states. Although those states are rarely
visited by the algorithm, such policies yield a notable speed-up in terms of
expected runtime. This makes the proposed benchmarks a challenging, but
promising testing ground for analysis of parameter control methods in rich
state spaces and of their ability to find optimal policies by catching the
performance improvements yielded by correct parameter choices.
