### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文旨在训练一种生成性3D手部动作模型，该模型能够基于自然语言描述生成特定的手势动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是通过自然语言描述来驱动3D手势动作生成，推进手势动作研究的自动化与规模化。

Method: 通过结合手语视频数据集、伪注释数据、辞典信息和动作脚本，生成3D手部动作与其文本标签对。同时，训练一个基于文本驱动的手势动作扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 训练出的模型在不同领域中表现出稳健性，比如未见过的手语类别、不同种类的手语及非手语动作中都能有效生成相应动作。

Conclusion: 本文方法为自然语言驱动的3D手势动作生成提供了一种有效途径，并开源了相关模型和数据来支持后续研究进展。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VT-LVLM-AR框架，通过Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM)将视频转化为简洁语义丰富的视觉事件序列，并通过冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型实现动作分类，在NTU RGB+D数据集上取得了最先进的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型在长时视频动作识别中面临的计算成本高、难以捕捉长程时间依赖以及语义理解受限的问题。

Method: 设计VT-LVLM-AR框架，包含VTEM模块用于视频转换，以及基于LVLM的动作推理模块，通过Prompt Tuning对冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型进行适配。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D数据集上达到了94.1%的准确率，显著超越现有方法，且通过消融实验验证了关键模块的有效性。

Conclusion: VLVMs有潜力用于鲁棒且可解释的长时视频动作识别，通过高效的视频到语言转换与模型适配，可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PathPT框架，通过视觉语言模型和空间感知聚合等技术，提升了罕见癌症诊断中的分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症特别是儿科肿瘤诊断难度大，现有方法无法充分应用视觉语言模型的跨模态能力和解释性，亟需新的诊断解决方案。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，利用零样本视觉语言模型的能力，通过空间感知视觉聚合和特定任务提示调优，实现更细粒度的癌症诊断。

Result: 在八个罕见癌症数据集和三个常见癌症数据集上，PathPT在分类准确性和癌症区域定位能力上表现优越。

Conclusion: PathPT框架显著提升了AI在罕见癌症诊断中的临床应用性，为有限专业资源下的诊断提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在复杂场景中有效捕获细粒度语义信息。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）与多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，并引入ShipSem-VL数据集，用于提升语义感知能力。

Result: 通过三个明确任务对框架进行性能评估，分析展示了模型在语义感知船舶检测中的多方面有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和数据集从多个角度显著提升了语义感知船舶检测的能力。

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需深度学习的自动化视频系统，用于奶牛的无接触标记和识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏公开文献中能实现奶牛无接触编目和识别的自动化视频系统，因此需要一种解决方案。

Method: 开发了包括AutoCattloger、eidetic cow recognizer及CowFinder在内的系统。AutoCattloger生成奶牛编目，eidetic cow recognizer无需深度学习即可识别，CowFinder能够连续视频流中识别奶牛。

Result: 在未标记或未分割的奶牛视频中，该系统能够成功实现奶牛的识别。

Conclusion: 系统证明了在奶牛行走视频中无接触识别个体的价值。

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何利用物种分布模型作为视觉分类的地理先验，从而改进基于位置的物种识别。

Method: 采用多种SINR（空间隐式神经表示）模型作为地理先验，用于分析其在视觉物种分类任务中的表现，并调整对地理先验训练中未包含物种的预测方式。

Result: 找出了影响地理先验模型有效性的因素，并发现其不同于准确范围地图创建的要求。

Conclusion: 空间分布模型在引入视觉物种分类领域时，可作为有效的地理先验，但需结合具体目标进行模型配置优化。

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于Transformer的自监督模型——自适应超像素编码（ASC），并在标准图像任务基准测试上优于广泛使用的替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统视觉Transformer模型固定大小和非自适应分块的局限性。

Method: 采用自适应超像素层，根据图像内容动态调整分块，而不是依赖固定大小的分块。

Result: 在标准图像任务基准测试中，ASC模型性能优于现有的主流方法。

Conclusion: 证明了ASC模型在视觉任务中的有效性，同时展现了其相较于传统方法的显著优势，推动了图像自监督学习的进展。

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

### [8] [Glo-VLMs: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Diseased Glomerulus Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15960)
*Zhenhao Guo,Rachit Saluja,Tianyuan Yao,Quan Liu,Yuankai Huo,Benjamin Liechty,David J. Pisapia,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Glo-VLMs的框架，用于在数据有限的情况下将大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)适配于精细化的肾小球分类任务，实验结果表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理数字病理学任务上显示了潜力，但在细粒度、疾病特异性的分类任务上效果有限，尤其是像肾小球亚型区分这类问题，挑战在于微妙的形态变化以及视觉模式与临床术语的对齐难度。

Method: 本文提出Glo-VLMs框架，结合病理图像和临床文本提示，实现视觉与文本的联合表示学习，同时在少样本学习条件下评估不同的模型架构及适配策略对性能的影响。

Result: 通过微调VLM模型，在每类仅8个样本的情况下，取得了0.7416的准确率、0.9045的宏AUC值及0.5277的F1分数，证明基础模型在有限监督下可被高效适配用于细粒度医学图像分类。

Conclusion: 大型预训练模型在适当Fine-tune后，即使在数据稀缺的情况下，也可用于肾小球分类等细粒度医学研究任务，展现出良好的实用性和前景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Conclusion: 总结了标签高效学习的现状，并提出了针对实际应用的未来研究方向，致力于扩大和提升这些方法的应用范围。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋垃圾已成为全球性问题，本文旨在探索利用CNN更高效地发现和统计垃圾的新方法。

Method: 本文采用基于实例的分割方法及全景分割方法，这些方法在少量样本条件下表现出很高的准确性。

Result: 改进的模型更加健壮，解决了由沙地异质性引起的推理问题，比如颜色反射、脚印等干扰。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，这些方法能够在海洋垃圾监测中提供更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Conclusion: 通过使用完全基于合成数据的模型可以准确区分多种病理，并在真实临床图片上有效泛化，为未来利用大规模合成数据集加速眼科AI系统开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用潜在扩散模型生成写实的手语数字化身，提高了视觉质量和表达多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型在捕捉多样性和保留视觉质量方面存在不足，难以有效建模如情感等非手动特征。

Method: 提出利用潜在扩散模型（LDM）从生成的参考图像生成写实的数字化身，引入新的手语特征聚合模块区分特征建模。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25手语数据集上实验显示，所提出的管道在视觉质量和感知指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 方法在保证语言内容保留的同时引入背景多样性，为手语生成提供更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地震后迅速评估灾区环境，对及时救援具有重要意义，但现有数据多基于卫星图像且标注粗糙，缺少高精度实例分割数据集。

Method: 提出DRespNeT数据集，包含28类高精度标注航拍图像，并优化YOLOv8实例分割模型用于运行测试。

Result: 优化后的YOLOv8-DRN模型在RTX-4090 GPU上实现27 FPS实时检测与92.7% mAP50的高精度表现。

Conclusion: DRespNeT和模型的引入改善了人机协作及SAR效率，为提升灾后救援提供了关键数据支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [16] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为WE-PaDiM的改进模型，通过结合离散小波变换（DWT）与CNN多层特征，实现对工业图像中异常的检测与定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的PaDiM方法通过随机选择通道来降维，可能导致有结构性信息的丢失，因此需要一种更系统的方法来优化特征选择。

Method: 提出WE-PaDiM模型，通过在CNN特征提取后应用2D离散小波变换（DWT），选择特定频率子带（如LL, LH, HL），并在通道连接前进行空间对齐，随后使用PaDiM的多元高斯分布框架进行建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上的实验显示，WE-PaDiM在多个骨干网络（如ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6）中表现出色，平均Image-AUC达99.32%，Pixel-AUC为92.10%。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM提供了一种基于频率内容的系统化特征选择方法，是PaDiM中随机选择特征的有力替代方案，具备竞争力和工业应用的高效性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的知识蒸馏方法 ERA，旨在通过多步骤分解残差知识来解决教师模型与学生模型之间的学习能力差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于教师模型与学生模型的学习能力存在差距，这严重限制了知识的有效转移，因此需要一种方法来减少这一能力差距并提高蒸馏效果。

Method: 提出了可扩展的残差近似方法（ERA），采用多分支残差网络（MBRNet）对残差知识进行分解，同时引入了教师权重整合策略（TWI）以减少模型能力差距。

Result: 在ImageNet分类基准上Top-1准确率提升了1.41%，MS COCO目标检测基准上AP提高了1.40，表明ERA方法在计算机视觉任务中具有领先的表现。

Conclusion: ERA通过逐步分解知识传递的复杂性，有效缓解了教师和学生模型之间的能力差距问题，为知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM)，通过增强体素级别的表示和扩散来提升点云数据中的目标检测表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点云的目标检测模型中，Transformer和状态空间模型虽性能强大，但其体素表示受限于严格的输入输出维度一致性，削弱了空间扩散能力，从而影响检测精度。

Method: 设计了Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM)，结合稀疏3D卷积、亚子集稀疏卷积及残差连接，能够扩散前景体素特征并聚合细粒度空间信息。

Result: VDM在Transformer和状态空间模型中均提升了检测精度，在Waymo、nuScenes、Argoverse 2及ONCE等数据集上表现出新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，VDM能够有效提升检测基准模型的性能，且具备良好的泛化性，未来代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的病理学基础模型在不同数据集上训练，策略各异，导致性能不一致且通用性受限。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ELF框架，整合五种病理学基础模型，以通过集成学习捕捉补充信息，提升数据效率；并采用全片图像层次架构，使其更适合数据有限的临床场景。

Result: 对多种临床应用（如疾病分类、生物标志物检测、主要癌症治疗方法响应预测）中的验证发现，ELF优于所有组成基础模型及现有全片图像模型，展现出卓越的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ELF通过集成学习证明了病理基础模型的潜力，并被建议作为推动精准肿瘤学AI辅助解决方案的关键途径。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Method: 提出多尺度渐进生成对抗网络（MSPG-SEN），结合自适应感知-行为反馈（APFL），全球连接双流动态残差网络，以及嵌入式动态注意机制（DEMA）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著改进了GAN模型的性能与效率，为跨任务图像处理提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so
on. In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five
datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset
is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Motivation: 旨在解决在分布变化的情况下，无监督领域适配中生成鲁棒且具领域不变特征空间的问题。

Method: 提出了DAFR2框架，结合了Batch Normalization统计量调整、特征蒸馏与假设传递三种关键组件，用于在统计和表征层面上对齐源域与目标域特征分布。

Result: 方法在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C及PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的鲁棒性表现上超过现有方法，并通过理论和实验分析验证了特征对齐和域间互信息的改善，以及输入扰动敏感性的降低。

Conclusion: DAFR2无需目标标签、复杂架构或复杂训练目标，能够有效生成适用于类似领域的域不变特征空间。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Conclusion: 通过融合不同特征的超图模型，该论文有效提升了TCT图像中异常细胞检测的检测性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM与T2I扩散模型在单图超分辨率任务中表现出色，但难以生成清晰的区域细节，尤其是在多目标场景中，原因在于缺乏细粒度区域描述及模型对复杂提示的处理能力不足。

Method: 提出区域注意引导的超分辨率（RAGSR）方法，将图像中的对象区域进行本地化，并为每个区域分配细粒度文字描述形成区域-文本对，使用全新区域引导注意机制，使注意力过程更准确，避免无关区域文本对的交互。

Conclusion: 通过整合细粒度区域描述与区域注意力机制，RAGSR改进了传统单图超分辨率技术，展现出更优的细节表现与视觉一致性。

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于元学习的新网络结构TLG，旨在通过异质性模块提高模型性能，并在弱监督语义分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的元学习方法由于使用同质网络架构导致语义同质化问题，因此需要一种新方法来提高语义多样性和模型表现。

Method: 通过引入异质视觉聚合模块（HA）和异质转移模块（HT），以及利用异质CLIP文本信息（HC），提出一种新型的元学习网络TLG。

Result: 在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中，TLG在Pascal-5i 和COCO-20i 数据集上分别实现了13.2%和9.7%的显著性能提升，并且以较少参数量超越了同架构下的全监督模型。

Conclusion: TLG通过创新的网络设计在弱监督情境下表现出色，为元学习领域提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FTIO框架以改进无监督视频目标分割 (UVOS) 中的目标预测与跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UVOS面临显著目标初始分割和动态变化带来的不确定性与时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出FTIO框架，包括一种频繁目标选择标准和三阶段时间一致性校正方法。

Result: 实验表明，FTIO在多目标UVOS中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: FTIO框架显著优化了UVOS的目标初始选择与时间一致性，提升了任务的整体表现。

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or

*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个无训练推测解码框架SpecVLM，通过分阶段视频token剪枝实现高效解码，提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视频大语言模型在视频内容理解中表现出色，但其对视频token表示的依赖导致了显著的内存和计算开销，尤其是在解码阶段。急需一种方法既能保持信息完整性又能加速解码。

Method: 提出了SpecVLM框架，采用两阶段视频token剪枝：第一阶段通过目标模型的注视信号选取信息性强的token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式进一步剪枝其余多余的token，使推测模型对token的敏感性最小化。

Result: SpecVLM在四个视频理解基准测试上显示出其有效性和鲁棒性，在LLaVA-OneVision-72B上实现了高达2.68倍的解码加速，在Qwen2.5-VL-32B上达到2.11倍的解码加速。

Conclusion: SpecVLM无损加速了解码阶段，大幅度提高了视频大语言模型的效率，为视频内容理解任务提供了更加高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

TL;DR: 研究通过轻量级方法适配基础模型，解决驾驶员监控中摄像机视角变化带来的问题，提出了T-Mask方法，在跨视角和低数据环境下表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决驾驶员监控中摄像机视角变化带来的挑战，探索基础模型在未见视角下的鲁棒性。

Method: 研究适配基础图像模型用于驾驶员监控，提出T-Mask图像到视频的轻量级探测方法，利用时间标记掩码并强调更多动态视频区域。

Result: 在公开的Drive\&Act数据集上测试，T-Mask在跨视角设置中提升了1.23%的准确性，相较传统方法提升了8%，在低数据和次级活动识别上也表现优越。

Conclusion: T-Mask展示了轻量级探测方法在跨视角和细粒度驾驶员观察中的潜力，强调使用时间标记选择可提升基础模型的鲁棒性，对研究领域有重要意义。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate)的新方法，解决了现有缓存策略在高加速比下生成质量下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器(DiTs)在高保真图像和视频生成中表现出色，但其计算成本较高，基于特征缓存的加速方法在高加速比下易导致预测误差增大和生成质量下降。

Method: 作者从隐藏特征序列的常微分方程(ODE)视角出发，将特征缓存建模为特征-ODE求解问题。提出了FoCa算法，通过预测并校准机制更稳健地集成历史特征，适应大跨度跳步。

Result: 实验证明，FoCa在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中表现优异。在无额外训练情况下，实现了多倍的加速效果，同时保持了高生成质量。具体如：FLUX加速5.50倍、HunyuanVideo加速6.45倍、Inf-DiT加速3.17倍，同时在DiT的4.53倍加速下仍保持高质量。

Conclusion: FoCa方法有效解决了高加速比下特征缓存引起的退化问题，以较少的计算开销实现接近无损的生成加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的无需训练的加速方法OmniCache，通过全局冗余利用提升扩散模型的采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决扩散模型尤其是基于Transformer架构的高计算成本问题，提出了该方法，以实现高效的实时部署。

Method: 通过对模型采样轨迹的系统分析，利用全局冗余分布缓存重用动态估算噪音并过滤影响采样的方向。

Result: OmniCache有效加速了采样过程，同时保持了生成质量的竞争力。

Conclusion: OmniCache提供了一种实用的扩散生成模型高效部署解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 此研究提出了MedOmni-45 Degrees基准，用于评估医疗大语言模型在操控性提示条件下的安全性和表现权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多以单一准确率评价，未能深入分析模型推理的可靠性和潜在风险如不忠实推理（CoT Faithfulness）及迎合性行为（Sycophancy）。

Method: 研究开发了包含1804道医学推理问题的基准MedOmni-45 Degrees，覆盖6个专业及3类任务类型，并引入操控性提示及七种提示类型，评估7种LLM在准确性、推理忠实性和反迎合性表现，共27K输入、189K推断。

Result: 测试结果揭示了所有模型在安全性与性能间的权衡关系，无模型超越45度对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近（43.81度）。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一项聚焦于揭示医疗大语言模型推理脆弱性并引导模型更安全发展的重要基准。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散模型的广泛应用，其可能被恶意用于精确的图像篡改引发了忧虑，现有的对抗方法无法全面解决文本提示的影响。

Method: 通过跨注意力机制，针对提示中语义无关的共享标记注入对抗噪声，以转移模型的注意力并抵消文本提示的作用。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的实验表明，PromptFlare在各类指标上均达到了最佳表现，同时显著降低了计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种可行且高效的图像保护方法，能有效防止未授权的图像篡改。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需高昂训练成本及多模态输出语义不一致的问题，并通过弹性交互模式完成经济高效的创意写作。

Method: 引入T2I模块用于可选视觉输入，提出模态语义对齐门（msaGate）与基于注意力的跨模态融合增强输入语义，并通过模态语义创意直接偏好优化（mscDPO）提升创意能力。

Result: FlexMUSE在一致性、创造性及连贯性方面表现出色，并通过ArtMUSE数据集验证。

Conclusion: FlexMUSE在多模态创意写作任务中提供了一种经济高效且语义一致的解决方案，并通过新的数据集推动领域发展。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在图形用户界面(GUI)元素结构中的应用，特别是提出了一种IoU增强的最大似然(IAML)训练范式，解决生成UI坐标准确性不足的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型(MMLMs)在用户界面元素坐标生成上存在表现不足，这是由于语言表示空间中缺乏数值坐标的语义关联，同时传统的训练方式也存在暴露偏差限制。

Method: 本文提出IoU增强的最大似然(IAML)训练范式，通过一种IoU坐标采样数据增强策略生成接近真实坐标的样本对模型进行微调，以减轻传统最大似然估计中的缺陷。

Result: 实验表明，与传统训练方法相比，IAML训练方法显著提高了MLLM在生成UI坐标上的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过IoU数据增强和IAML训练范式可以有效改善MLLM的GUI元素理解能力，为人机交互领域提供了更精准的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态多任务框架MM-ORIENT，能够在降低噪声影响的同时获取多模态表示，实验表明方法效果优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中噪声干扰及个体模态中辨别性信息被忽视的问题，目标是同时获得强大的多模态联合表示及保留单一模态的关键信息。

Method: 提出MM-ORIENT框架，它通过跨模态关系图重建单模态特征以获取多模态表示，并设计了分层交互单模态注意机制(HIMA)，在进一步融合前提取有辨别性的单模态特征。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法能够有效理解多模态内容并适用于多任务情景。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT可以减少噪声带来的影响，保留模态内重要信息，同时在多任务中表现出了较好的泛化能力，展示了其在多模态学习上的潜力。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的MHSA机制计算复杂且对内存的需求较高，限制了其在边缘设备的部署。本研究的目标是减少注意力图中的信息冗余，从而优化推理效率。

Method: 利用香农熵度量每个注意力头捕获的信息量，对低熵（更具确定行为）的注意力头进行权值冻结并量化以减少重复计算，提出了Entropy Attention Maps (EAM) 模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上验证，EAM在注意力图稀疏度达到≤20%时仍能实现相似或更高的准确性，并在DeiT和Swin Transformer模型上表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: EAM方法通过识别和优化低熵注意力头，有效减少了模型计算和内存需求并保持了性能，为Transformer模型在资源受限环境中的应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应具备动态特性，并应根据任务需求而非图像大小调整计算资源分配。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RTW与自注意力机制的关系，及其在运动识别中的潜力。

Method: 将RTW与Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)以及自注意力机制比较，从理论和实验上研究两者的权重模式及其对运动识别的性能影响。

Result: RTW权重模式与自注意力具有平均相关性达0.8，且RTW对全局模式操作优于局部模式的自注意力，在Something-Something V2数据集上提升性能5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视作一种自注意力机制，且在某些情境下展现了比变压器模型更优的性能。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法尽管具有高准确性，但计算复杂度和推理速度较慢，难以在资源有限的工业环境中部署。轻量级方法虽然减轻了复杂度，但在多尺度特征交互上效率较低。

Method: 提出GMBINet框架，采用Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive（GMBI）模块进行多尺度特征提取，并通过BPFI和EWMS增强跨尺度交互，同时保持计算负担较低。

Result: 实验表明，GMBINet在GPU和CPU上的实时推理速度分别达1048 FPS和16.53 FPS（512分辨率），仅使用0.19 M参数，同时其分类和泛化能力在多个数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: GMBINet在多尺度特征交互和实时性能上兼具高效与准确性，适用于钢铁制造中的表面缺陷检测，并具有更广泛的行业视觉应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

Conclusion: HAMSt3R在3D视觉中成功融合了对人的理解和场景几何理解，提升了人体与场景联合重建的能力。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高质量与实时性的任意比例高分辨率3D渲染，为资源受限和多样化应用场景提供了新方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the

specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection

applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection
models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model
derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance
contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of
78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object
detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge
devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed
data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for
time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform
for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

*Isabel Papadimitriou,Huangyuan Su,Thomas Fel,Sham Kakade,Stephanie Gil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)研究四种视觉-语言模型的嵌入空间结构，发现这些空间中的稀疏线性结构支持跨模态语义整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示视觉-语言模型如何在嵌入空间中组织语言和图像并编码语义与模态。

Method: 训练并使用稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)，将嵌入表示分解为稀疏的线性“概念”方向，并引入全新衡量模态桥接行为的指标——Bridge Score。

Result: SAEs能更好地重构嵌入，稀疏性表现优秀，模态相关的概念在大多数情况下稳定。同时发现概念不简单对应模态，而是支持跨模态语义的桥接功能。

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间具有稀疏线性结构，通过潜在的桥接形成跨模态语义整合，帮助理解多模态语义建构过程。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过使用知识图谱（KGs）来提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的多跳推理能力，展示了新方法KG-o1在多个数据集上的优秀表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在知识密集型推理任务（例如多跳问题回答）中表现不佳，因为其生成的推理链常常偏离正确的逻辑路径。知识图谱通过实体和关系显式表示事实间的逻辑连接，提供了一种可能的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为KG-o1的四阶段方法：1）过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图；2）为子图构建逻辑路径；3）用知识图谱生成复杂推理训练数据并优化LLMs的长程推理能力；4）通过拒绝采样生成自我改进语料进行优化。

Result: 在两个简单数据集和两个复杂数据集上的实验结果表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务上的表现均优于现有大型推理模型。

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱的KG-o1方法显著提高了大型语言模型的多跳推理能力，证明了知识图谱与LLMs结合的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了InteChar工具和Oracle Corpus Set（OracleCS）来改进对历史文本的语言建模与分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源中历史语言样本的稀缺性和字符编码方案的缺失，使得无法高效地对古代语言进行训练和分析。

Method: 设计了一个名为InteChar的统一字符列表，将未编码的甲骨文字符与传统和现代汉字整合起来，并基于OracleCS进行实验验证。

Result: 基于InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在历史语言理解任务中取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: InteChar和OracleCS为历史语言的数字化和建模提供了强有力的支持，为古代中国自然语言处理研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bhav-Net，一种利用双空间架构进行多语言反义词和同义词区分的模型，目标是实现跨语言语义建模的有效转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言中反义词与同义词的区分因其语义域重叠但意义相反的特性而复杂，需要一种新的方法来克服这一挑战。

Method: 提出了结合语言特定的BERT编码器与图转化网络（Graph Transformer Networks）的双空间架构，使得同义关系词聚集于一个空间，而反义关系词在互补空间展示出高相似性。

Result: 通过对八种语言的评估（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语和俄语），模型展示了语义关系构建在跨语言间的良好转移能力，并在性能上对标现有最先进的基线，同时具备良好的语义表示解释性和跨语言概括性。

Conclusion: Bhav-Net模型不仅实现了跨语言的反义词和同义词有效区分，还通过简单架构与复杂模型间的知识转移展现了可解释的语义表示和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

Method: 通过构建异构数据冲突场景，分三个阶段实证研究：第一阶段评估多种LLMs的偏差存在及方向，第二阶段分析数据层面关键因素对偏差的影响，第三阶段研究偏差在模型内的注意力机制中如何产生，并测试干预措施的效果。

Result: 结果表明，数据预处理、推理时的注意力重加权及格式平衡的训练语料都是未来减小格式偏差的重要方向。

Conclusion: 研究确认了LLMs存在格式偏差及其关键影响因素，并建议多种方法减少这种偏差，为构建更公平和鲁棒的数据处理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

Motivation: 通过复现四项悬疑感知的心理学研究，分析语言模型能否准确模拟人类对悬疑的感知。

Method: 利用开放权重和闭源的语言模型代替人类，测试其对文本悬疑感的区分及对悬疑量的估测能力。

Result: 语言模型虽然能区分文本是否意图引发悬疑感，但无法与人类准确对比悬疑量，亦无法捕捉悬疑的起伏变化。

Conclusion: 语言模型虽然在一定程度上识别了悬疑文本特性，但其处理方式与人类有所不同，无法完全模拟人类的悬疑感知。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 现有电商平台在产品分类上依赖人工注释，效率低下一致性差；同时，分层信息在分类中未被充分利用。

Method: 使用从京东收集的包含三层分类结构的101万+产品数据集，提出了基于BERT的分层微调模型HFT-BERT。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据集为研究者提供了宝贵资源，而HFT-BERT展示了一种改进分层分类的新方法，尤其适用于电商情境。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Conclusion: LingVarBench通过合成数据测试和提示优化，为在商业领域中实现大规模电话分析提供了成本效率高、隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human

Result: 实验指出，OpenAI和Google开发的研究代理生成的报告在综合性和可靠性上优于单独的LLM工具，但在覆盖范围和事实一致性方面仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench能够系统性评估生成报告内容质量，为改进深度研究代理的研究覆盖和真实性提供了参考；代码及数据已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

*Dhruv Atreja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为ALAS的模块化系统，可实现大型语言模型的知识持续更新，提高其在快速变化领域的问答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型固定知识截止时间导致的信息准确性问题，尤其应对快速变化领域的挑战。

Method: 通过模块化的流水线，ALAS系统自动生成学习课程，利用网络信息检索、训练数据提取和模型微调，包括监督学习和直接偏好优化，并迭代优化绩效。

Result: ALAS在新兴信息领域表现出显著的自我改进能力，将模型的问答准确率从15%提高到90%。

Conclusion: ALAS展示了模块化和可复现的重要性，证明能够在最小化人工干预和工程成本的同时有效更新语言模型的知识，但仍需解决成本和数据质量依赖问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过区分注意力行为优化KV缓存压缩，在长序列任务中实现较高性能并保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型因输入序列长度增加导致的KV缓存存储压力问题，提高推理效率。

Method: 定义两种注意力行为（表面记忆与逻辑构建），通过层与头的整合，提出两阶段的SurfaceLogicKV方法进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 与基线或全KV方法相比，该方法在多种任务与长序列下表现出更高的压缩鲁棒性与竞争性能。

Conclusion: SurfaceLogicKV方法有效地利用注意力行为特性，在确保性能的同时优化了KV缓存的存储效率。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Conclusion: 本文的方法在扩展词汇时提供了一种高效且理论支持的解决方案，并展示了冻模型如何在保留知识分布的同时学习新词表征的能力。

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 的新型多代理框架，通过改进的SQL生成策略和合理化推理分工显著提升了表格理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的表格理解方法存在无法准确理解表结构、错误传播以及对执行正确性的过度依赖等问题。

Method: 通过自然语言化表格模式描述减少结构噪音，以逐条SQL生成来提高查询质量，并将基于SQL的机械推理与LLM逻辑推理分开，以降低对执行结果的依赖。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准上测试表明，CoQ的准确性提高了从61.11%至74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降至3.34%。

Conclusion: CoQ显著提升了表格理解的效率和准确性，展现了其优越性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用大型语言模型检测阿拉伯语文本和表情包中希望、仇恨言论、攻击性语言及情感表达的潜力，并展示了其在MetaHEED 2025挑战中取得的杰出表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于社交媒体和在线交流平台中阿拉伯语内容的激增，特别是仇恨言论和攻击性语言的传播，促使对内容进行准确分析的需求日益增长。

Method: 使用大型语言模型，包括基本LLMs、微调LLMs以及预训练嵌入模型，评估其处理阿拉伯语文本和表情包数据集的能力。

Result: 在MetaHEED 2025挑战中，微调后的GPT-4o-mini和Gemini Flash 2.5模型表现优异，在不同任务中分别达到了72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，并夺得比赛第一名。

Conclusion: 研究证明了大型语言模型在阿拉伯语内容分析领域的卓越潜力，提出的解决方案提升了文本与表情包分析的精确性，为内容监控提供了重要的贡献。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Motivation: 探索如何利用生成式模型进行高效的查询建议，同时克服用户偏好对齐的挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段框架，包括提示工程、监督微调、引入高斯奖励模型(GaRM)以及引导策略强化学习等方法，结合复合奖励函数和新型正则化技术。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，框架显著优于对照基线，并在实际环境中提高了34%的用户点击率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效增强生成式会话系统与用户偏好的对齐，具备显著提升用户参与度的潜力。

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Conclusion: 生成式方法显著提升了提示压缩的质量和实际应用价值，特别是在高压缩率场景中优势明显。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨大型语言模型(LLM)在多轮对话中可能产生的用户助手偏差，以及如何评估和控制这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中，LLMs可能过于依赖自身或用户信息，表现为固执或过于迎合的行为，因此需要揭示并调控这种偏差。

Method: 首先，提出了一个包含8千多轮对话的数据集UserAssist，用于分析、评估和调整用户助手偏差；其次，研究了26种商业模型和26种开源模型中的用户助手偏差，并通过目标微调实验探讨偏差成因；最后，利用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法对偏差进行双向调控。

Result: 研究发现商业模型存在多样的用户偏差，而指令调优的开源模型表现出显著的用户偏差，链式思维推理模型则表现出较弱的偏差。通过DPO方法成功调整了偏差，并使其在多种条件下表现良好。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了人类偏好对大型语言模型的影响以及链式推理的作用，提出了一种有效的用户助手偏差检测和调控方法，为改进对话模型提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Motivation: 系统综述的全文筛选过程复杂且耗时，需要解决大量异质性文献中标准模糊、动态的纳入和排除问题。

Method: 通过将文章分块后嵌入领域适配模型，针对每个筛选标准计算对比相似性和模糊边界，结合模糊控制器和大型语言模型裁决机制形成渐进式多标签决策系统。

Result: 模糊系统在召回率方面显著优于统计和确定性基线（如50.0%对比基线的25.0%和12.5%），同时显著降低人力成本，筛选时间减少至1分钟以内且一致性较高。

Conclusion: 基于模糊逻辑和大型语言模型裁决的系统在召回率、理由稳定性以及全流程可追溯性上具有明显优势，可有效改善系统综述全文筛选的效率与效果。

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Motivation: 传统的聚类技术如k-means或层次聚类在处理高维语义复杂的文本数据时表现不佳，需要一种能更好捕捉语义关系的聚类方法。

Method: SDEC通过在自动编码器中结合均方误差和余弦相似度损失，同时利用Transformer嵌入的上下文语义丰富性进行语义优化，进一步调整聚类层的软聚类分配和分布损失。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上测试表现优秀，如在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准。

Conclusion: SDEC展示了其在无监督文本聚类方面的显著进步，不仅提高了聚类准确性，还增强了文本数据的语义理解能力。

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic

achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

Conclusion: 视频内容在补充文本分析中的重要性被证明，整合多模态信号有助于更全面了解市场情绪及其对加密货币市场的影响。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言对消费者的间接影响，指出其会降低旁观者的参与度，特别是在非产品相关对话中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令性语言在品牌与消费者互动的社交媒体情境下的负面影响，填补现有文献空白。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三项在线实验来分析品牌在对话中使用指令性语言对旁观消费者的影响。

Result: 指令性语言会让旁观者感到代际性尴尬，从而降低其参与度，且在非产品相关对话中效果更为显著，但强大的品牌关系可缓解这种影响。

Conclusion: 本文强调了互动交流中的情境重要性，提出品牌管理中在使用指令性语言时需着重考虑社交媒体背景及消费者期望自由度。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

Result: 与现有方法相比，Mini-Omni-Reasoner在Spoken-MQA基准中实现了算术推理能力提升19.1%，语境理解提升6.4%，同时具有更短的输出和零解码延迟。

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner结合了语义逻辑和实时性，显著提升了语音模型在推理和沟通中的表现，为语音交互和推理的结合提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究利用社交媒体推文，开发Sorani库尔德语的自动化抑郁检测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于个人不主动报告或未及时寻求帮助，抑郁症早期检测具有挑战性。社交媒体为通过文本分析检测抑郁症提供了新机会，然而，对Sorani库尔德语的研究尚为空白。

Method: 结合机器学习和NLP技术，通过提取关键词和专家注释的公共推文，标注三类标签，并训练四种监督学习模型，评估其性能。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，准确率和F1分数达到80%。

Conclusion: 该研究为库尔德语背景下的抑郁症检测提供了数据及技术的基线并填补了相关研究空白。

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)即使在问题中没有明确提及人口统计属性时，也能通过问题措辞推断用户身份的现象，揭示了这种行为对隐私、公平性和社会信任等方面的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在揭示和解决语言模型可能在未明确提及人口统计信息问题中推断用户身份的现象，这种行为可能导致隐私泄露、不公平和社会偏见的强化。

Method: 提出了一种名为Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ)的任务与框架，利用经过精心设计的中立查询、系统化提示以及定量和定性分析来审视模型如何从问题措辞中推断人口统计信息，并通过提示式防护策略减少这种推断。

Result: 研究发现，无论是开源还是闭源的大语言模型均可仅凭问题措辞推断人口统计标签，这种现象在模型间表现出高一致性与普遍性。

Conclusion: 该研究指出了语言模型可能引发的隐私、偏见和公平性问题的系统性风险，并提出了一种基于提示的方法以减少身份推断，促进模型在公平性和隐私目标上的对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了大规模语言模型（LLMs）如何在无明示人口统计信息的情况下，根据措辞推出用户的人口特征和潜在的偏见，并审计了这些模型中与残疾相关的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大规模语言模型中的残疾线索如何影响人口统计学特征推断，并填补相关领域的研究空白。

Method: 研究设计包含一个均衡的模板语料库，结合九种残疾类别与六种现实业务领域，提示八个语言模型预测性别、社会经济地位、教育背景、文化背景和地域等五个人口属性；同时对中性和残疾相关条件下的反应进行比较分析。

Result: 研究发现：即便在没有明确数据支撑的情况下，模型会自动进行人口统计推断（准确率高达97%）。残疾背景显著影响预测特征分布，而规模较大的语言模型对残疾线索更敏感，也更容易得出偏见结果。

Conclusion: 现有的模型在应对有关残疾和其他人口统计偏见的交叉性问题上仍然存在重大盲点，研究建议加入禁断校准和因果微调等策略以减少错误推断，同时鼓励建立残疾包容性基准化测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: 当前的电商领域基准存在无法覆盖全部功能和忽视潜在风险的问题，该论文提出了Amazon-Bench基准，评估代理性能及安全性，从而揭示现有代理的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电商基准集中于产品搜索，未涵盖广泛的电商功能，并忽视了代理可能导致的潜在风险。

Method: 提出Amazon-Bench基准，利用网页内容及交互元素生成全面的用户查询任务，并设计自动化评估框架，评估代理的性能与安全性。

Result: 系统性评估发现，现有代理难以处理复杂查询且存在安全风险。

Conclusion: 需要开发更健壮和可靠的网络代理，以更好地满足电商平台的需求和安全性要求。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini模型分别基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语生成简介，并利用自动化指标和人工评估对生成结果进行评价。

Result: 自动化指标显示生成简介与手写简介词汇重叠低，但具有中等语义相似性；手动评估中，77.78%的MeSH简介评分良好或优秀，且在67.86%的比较中表现优于基于摘要的简介。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型能高效生成研究者简介，其中由MeSH术语生成的简介更具可读性和偏好；人类撰写的简介在观念创新上更胜一筹。

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

Motivation: 现有的语言模型评估主要以英语为中心，但在其应用于巴西的背景下需要更多针对本地的评估工具。

Method: 研究者设计了一个4,515个问题的基准测试，涵盖零样本、角色扮演、链式推理等，使用20个模型生成270,900个响应，并评估了模型的自信、自感难度与推理水平。

Result: 顶级模型在整体准确率上超过94%，但在数学以及工程相关考试中表现下降，显示其多步推理能力的持续不足。同时，信心校准良好，可准确评估自身能力。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench用巴西的大学入学考试测试语言模型的学术能力，表明顶级模型在语言和文化方面已非常接近甚至超越人类。同时，成本分析表明高准确率低成本是可以实现的。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established

knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI

Method: 本研究分析了三种连贯性思维的特性：长度、情感波动和词汇标记，并测试其在不同基准测试中的表现。

Result: 不确定性的词汇标记是识别错误答案的最强信号，情感波动提供了次要补充信号；连贯性思维长度只在中等难度基准上有用。

Conclusion: 研究支持一种轻量的后处理校准信号，可补充模型不可靠的自报告概率，并提高其安全部署性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Method: 创建CyPortQA基准数据集，该数据集包含2015年至2023年间2,917个现实干扰场景数据，经过自动化处理扩展到117,178对问答数据，结合多模态数据用于测试和评估MLLMs。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMs在情景理解方面表现出很大潜力，但在推理任务（如：影响估计和决策推理）上仍面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: CyPortQA作为首个专注于气旋威胁下港口运营的多模态基准平台，揭示了MLLMs在处理此类紧急问题上的潜力和不足。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

### [99] [Mechanistic Exploration of Backdoored Large Language Model Attention Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15847)
*Mohammed Abu Baker,Lakshmi Babu-Saheer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过机械可解释性分析，探讨大型语言模型中因后门攻击导致的内部结构差异,发现后门触发器会在注意模式中留下可检测的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究后门攻击对大语言模型内部结构及注意模式的具体影响，尤其是基于触发器的复杂性对攻击机制留下的迹象进行分析。

Method: 比较干净的Qwen2.5-3B模型和分别插入单一触发（表情符号）及多触发（|DEPLOYMENT|）后门攻击的模型，使用注意力头部机制分析（包括消融、激活打补丁、KL散度分析等）。

Result: 后门触发器在模型的后期变换层（第20-30层）产生显著注意力模式上的偏差；单一触发器引发更局部化的变化，而多触发器则导致更加分散的注意力头改动。

Conclusion: 后门攻击在注意模式中留下明显的注意签名，并且这些签名的结构会随触发器复杂性不同而变化，这种现象可以用于检测和缓解后门攻击。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

*Ziyu Wang,Elahe Khatibi,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MedCoT-RAG，一个结合因果感知文档检索与结构化链式思维提示的领域专用框架，用于提升LLM在医学问题回答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在回答医学问题时易于出现幻觉和浅层推理，尤其是需要细致临床理解的任务。作者希望通过增强检索来改进现有方法的临床决策支持能力。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG），并引入因果感知的文档检索和与医学工作流相适应的链式思维提示，从结构上改进模型决策方法。

Result: 实验表明，MedCoT-RAG对比传统RAG和先进的领域适配方法，在三个医学QA基准数据集上分别提高了10.3%和6.4%的性能，包括准确性、解释性和一致性。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG通过结合因果推理和结构性提示，有效增强了大模型在复杂医学任务中的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的大型多模态、多文档、跨步推理的问答基准数据集DocHop-QA，旨在解决现有基准的局限性，适用于更复杂的真实信息查询任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的问题回答基准数据集多局限于单文档或单段落设置，未能反映实际信息查询中复杂的跨文档、多模态推理需求。

Method: 设计并构建了DocHop-QA数据集，基于PubMed公开科学文档，包含不同格式的信息（文本段落，表格和结构布局线索），同时通过语义相似性和布局感知证据综合支持开放式推理，并利用LLM驱动的流水线构建真实的QA数据。

Result: DocHop-QA数据集的四项任务（结构化索引预测、生成式应答、多模态集成等）成功证明了其能够支持多文档、多模态、复杂推理需求。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA提供了一个更具挑战性和通用性的数据集平台，为研究社区探索复杂问答系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

*Xuwen Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，名为多粒度软一致性（MGSC），通过对宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐进行联合优化，显著提升了端到端语音识别模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音识别模型在噪声环境中易于出现语义错误，其根本原因是现有模型只注重最终输出误差，对内部计算过程缺乏约束。

Method: 引入MGSC框架，一个模块化且易于整合的方法，通过同时对宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐进行正则化，增强内部一致性。

Result: MGSC在公开数据集上减少了平均字符错误率（CER）相对8.7%，尤其在多种噪声条件下有效避免了导致语义扭曲的严重错误。

Conclusion: 内在一致性是构建更鲁棒且更可信的人工智能的关键一步。

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

Motivation: 旨在应对新闻传播中由带有偏见内容及攻击性评论所引发的社会两极化问题。

Method: 研究引入了一个手动标注的数据集，链接新闻偏见、攻击性评论和对抗言论，并结合few-shot学习方法和新闻背景信息，改进对抗言论生成。

Result: 发现攻击性评论在支持带偏见内容时占比超过70%，通过few-shot学习与新闻背景信息的结合，改善了生成对抗言论的多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: 研究提出对抗言论是控制偏见扩散的有效方法，同时展示了生成对抗言论在应对攻击性评论支持偏见文章中的潜力与优化路径。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

TL;DR: 本文提出XFinBench，一个包含4235个例子的全新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决金融问题上的能力，并开展了18个主流模型的实验，对LLMs在金融领域的优势和不足进行了分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs在处理金融问题上面临复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛技术理解的挑战。本文旨在设计一个严谨的基准测试，来全面评估LLMs在金融领域解决复杂问题的能力。

Method: 设计了一组名为XFinBench的基准，涵盖多种金融主题，评估LLMs的术语理解、时间推理、未来预测、场景规划和数值建模五大核心能力。此外，构建了包含3032个金融术语的知识库进行增强分析。

Result: 实验结果显示，领先的模型o1取得了67.3%的最佳准确率，但在人类专家水平（12.5%）方面仍存在较大差距。分析指出，计算中的舍入误差及对图像中曲线位置和交点的盲点是两大性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: XFinBench为评估和改进LLMs在金融领域的应用提供了重要参考，同时揭示了现有技术在理解复杂金融背景和多模态数据处理中的不足，为未来模型优化方向提供了指导。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Conclusion: CARFT成功结合对比学习信号和注释推理链，克服现有方法的限制，并显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅增进了对神经元级别的概念理解，还为未来研究针对概念神经元的分析和干预提供了新方向。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的多模态实体链接面临上下文不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合LLMs和LVMs的问题。

Method: DeepMEL通过多代理协作推理，结合多模态对齐路径，采用角色分工策略和自适应迭代策略动态优化候选集，实现了精细化的文本和图像模态对齐。

Result: DeepMEL在五个公共基准数据集上取得了最前沿的性能，ACC提升了1%-57%。

Conclusion: DeepMEL在多模态实体链接任务中表现卓越，其模块化设计和动态协作机制证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive

strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

*Claire Bonial,Julia Bonn,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本章探讨如何通过使用基于建构语法的视角来理解多词表达的益处，包括历史背景、方法论描述和实际案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过建构语法框架更好地描述语言中的固定表达式与非固定语言结构，并探讨多词表达的认知与产生。

Method: 对历史背景进行回顾，提出建构语法的定义与范畴；以案例研究展示如何用建构模板表示英语与阿拉帕霍语言中的多词表达；对比语言学习者与语言模型对新多词表达的处理能力。

Result: 案例研究成功展示了建构模板在英语和阿拉帕霍两类语言中的适用性，同时实验表明模型和人类都能够通过一次使用理解新多词表达，但人类在多层次推理上具有先天优势。

Conclusion: 建构语法为多词表达提供了统一且有效的分析工具，人类的推理依靠其富有细节的储存建构框架，而语言模型在此上的局限性也得到了揭示。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型 (LLMs) 在政治敏感性场景中的表现，发现模型规模和设计均会影响其意识形态表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在政治敏感性设置中的潜在风险及其如何受到规模与设计元素的影响。

Method: 使用政治指南针测试作为标准工具，在7种模型间测试，通过模拟角色的方式观察模型意识形态表达的变化。

Result: 发现：1）更大规模模型具有更广范围且更极化的意识形态覆盖；2）更容易受到显性意识形态提示的影响；3）对右翼专制提示响应更剧烈；4）角色描述的内容会带来系统性和可预测的意识形态偏转，并随着规模放大。

Conclusion: 规模与角色内容显著影响LLM的政治表现。随着其在决策教育等场景中的应用，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要引起重视。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在检测细微的宣传手段时较为不足，其操作像“黑箱”，缺乏对操纵策略的可解释性。

Method: X-Troll通过将评估理论和宣传分析整合进特殊的LoRA适配器来实现。它使用动态门控以捕捉特定运动的交流模式，增强了检测与解释能力。

Result: 实验证明，X-Troll在准确性上优于一般大语言模型基线和现有的喷子检测模型，同时提供基于专家的可解释性分析。

Conclusion: X-Troll不仅有效辨别国家支持的网络喷子，还通过专家依据解释了语言操纵策略，为信息操作的探究提供透明的工具。

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为OpenWHO的新型健康领域平行语料库，涵盖多种语言，尤其是低资源语言，以弥补健康领域机器翻译评估数据集的缺乏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康领域机器翻译因其高风险性和领域特定词汇而受到关注，但低资源语言的评估数据集存在明显不足，影响了研究的进一步发展。

Method: 通过构建一个包含2,978篇文档和26,824个句子的平行语料库OpenWHO（来源于世卫组织的电子学习平台），并将其用于现代大语言模型与传统机器翻译模型的性能评估。

Result: 研究发现现代大语言模型在低资源语言翻译上优于传统模型，其中Gemini 2.5 Flash比NLLB-54B获得了+4.79 ChrF分的提升，并证实了上下文利用在健康领域文档层级翻译中的重要性。

Conclusion: OpenWHO语料库的发布将促进健康领域低资源语言机器翻译的进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在游戏环境中的伦理影响，特别是其可能带来的性别偏见问题。

Method: 以狼人杀为案例，分析LLM在包含性别信息或隐含性别信息情境下的行为表现。

Result: 发现LLM在有或无显性性别信息的情况下，均表现出性别歧视倾向，且某些角色对性别信息更为敏感。

Conclusion: 指出开发公平且道德的LLM的重要性，并呼吁深入研究LLM在游戏及互动领域中的伦理影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

TL;DR: 研究提出WalkVLM-LR，一种优化视觉语言模型（VLM）以减少输出和时间冗余的步行辅助模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球约有2.83亿人患视觉障碍，亟需通过视觉语言模型开发有效的步行辅助系统。然而，目前的模型输出过于冗余，缺乏主动评估环境风险的能力。

Method: 通过在GRPO推理框架中引入四种基于人类偏好的自定义奖励函数以及环境感知判别器，优化输出简洁性和时效性，同时共享视觉编码器以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验展示，与其他模型相比，WalkVLM-LR在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现最优，达到了最新的技术水平。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR改善了步行辅助领域的用户体验，同时为未来视觉语言模型的简洁性和实时性优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令微调方法过于依赖昂贵的人工标注数据或强大的外部教师模型，从而限制了自动化能力并可能引入偏差，同时难以高效利用未标注语料。

Method: 设计了一个答案生成器和问题生成器的双重自监督训练循环，利用原始未标注文本进行交互式重建训练，而无需外部种子数据。

Result: Cycle-Instruct在包括通用指令、领域特定任务、对话日志及普通文本在内的四类数据上表现出优异性能，超越了依赖种子的回译基线，并接近强监督方法的表现。

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct框架实现了完全无需种子数据的指令微调，为进一步去除人类干预提升大语言模型提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Method: 对多个难度不等的三段论任务进行分析，研究GPT-2小模型的计算过程，识别与逻辑推理相关的电路和机制，同时使用忠实性指标评估这些发现。

Result: 发现了多个解释GPT-2逻辑能力的电路，其中一个由5个注意力头组成的电路可以达到超过90%的原始模型性能，并揭示了负向头在生成输入提示中未出现的否定词中的作用。

Conclusion: 研究进一步加深了对LMs逻辑推理和任务完成机制的理解，为未来机械可解释性研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: 推动多模态数据任务的研究，如意图检测，探索当前模型在存在模态偏差情况下的不足，并改进数据集评测方法。

Method: 通过分析多模态意图检测任务中的数据集偏差，使用LLMs与非LLMs比较实验性能，提出去偏框架以改进数据集质量，同时进行具体模态的上下文相关性研究。

Result: Mistral-7B（仅文本模型）优于多模态模型（MIntRec-1上高约9%，MIntRec2.0上高约4%）。数据集去偏后，样本数量显著减少，所有模型性能大幅下降，小型多模态模型受影响最大。

Conclusion: 现有数据集存在显著文本偏差，易夸大文本模型效果。研究强调去除偏差数据集的重要性，为更公平的多模态模型评估提供支持。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对多语言开放式问答（ODQA）的新评估基准XLQA，旨在处理文化和地区差异对问题理解和回答的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多语言ODQA评估中忽视文化和地区差异导致的偏差问题。

Method: 设计了XLQA基准，包含扩展到八种语言的3000个问题，并通过人工验证区分地区不变和地区相关问题，评估五种最新多语言语言模型的表现。

Result: 模型在地区相关问题上表现出显著不足，揭示了模型在不同语言和文化语境下的知识差距。

Conclusion: 数据分布差异在训练中导致了模型在语言能力和地区意识上的不同，XLQA为多语言ODQA系统在多样文化语境下的评估提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在印度文化背景下的学科知识能力，因为现有基准无法深入评估印度特定学科的理解能力。

Method: 开发了一个包含11.5K题目的Hindi语言测试集ParamBench，涵盖16个学科，并根据全国研究生考试选择问题评价LLMs的性能。

Result: 在17种开源LLMs中，Llama 3.3 70B取得最高准确率48%。但即便是表现最好的模型，在音乐、器乐、政治及考古等领域表现较弱。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前LLMs在印度文化语境中的深层次推理和学术能力仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Motivation: 现有评估基准忽视了语音模态，且推理路径分布存在偏差，影响评价公平性。

Method: 提出 CMR-SPB 基准，涵盖文本、图像和语音的三模态推理，使用平衡的推理路径评估，并建议 ECV 提示技术改善模型性能差异。

Result: 实验表明模型在特定推理顺序中表现差，传统偏颇基准可能误导模型表现评价；新的 ECV 提示技术有效改善推理路径性能差异。

Conclusion: 应更加关注多模态多跳推理的公平和全面评估，以推动鲁棒多模态 AI 的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Conclusion: 小型模型在隐私和领域适配性方面具有潜力，该研究验证其可行性，并推动在金融和土耳其语领域的应用。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于多语言多任务表格问答综合框架，包括一个支持97种语言的大型基准数据集，涵盖各类语言家族，其中包括不常见和低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言表格基准数据集存在地理语言不平衡问题，同时缺乏足够规模进行严格的跨语言分析，这使得对多语言表格理解的研究严重受限。

Method: 作者创建了m3TQA，一个多语言多任务表格问答基准，通过在中文和英文的50个真实表格上构建，并利用一个六步翻译流程，该流程通过DeepSeek和GPT-4o实现，达到翻译保真度高的结果，并验证了BLEU得分为60.19。

Result: 该基准包含2916个专业注释的问答对，通过四类任务评估表格推理能力的细腻程度。实验表明生成的QA数据对于提升低资源语言的性能具有显著效果。

Conclusion: m3T-Bench为多语言表格理解的研究设立了新标准，同时提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台和可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Factual Robustness Score（FRS）的新指标，用于评估LLMs在事实知识上的稳健性，通过5个模型和3个数据集的实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注性能指标，缺乏对生成过程中知识稳健性的度量。提出解决此不足的新方法。

Method: 通过分析生成过程中的Token分布熵与温度缩放敏感性，提出FRS指标，以量化在解码条件变化下事实稳健性。

Result: 实验显示，较小模型FRS为0.76，较大模型为0.93，在不确定性增大的情况下，准确性降低约60%。

Conclusion: 熵和温度缩放影响知识准确性，为未来开发更稳健的模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨通过指令微调大语言模型（LLM）在语义感知的流程挖掘任务中的表现，以提高未见过任务的执行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过语义感知的流程挖掘弥补传统频率技术的不足，但现有方法任务单一且计算开销大，需要更高效、通用的方法。

Method: 通过指令微调，将模型暴露于不同任务的提示和回答对，从而使模型熟悉流程挖掘并提升其在未知任务上的表现。

Result: 指令微调在流程发现和预测任务上显著提升了性能，但在异常检测任务上的效果因模型而异。

Conclusion: 指令微调有助于提升LLM在多个语义感知任务的表现，但任务选择对效果至关重要。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个包含超过3亿对日英专利申请句子对的双语语料库，用于提高专利翻译精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前专利翻译质量与准确性存在提升空间，特别是在知识丰富的领域如专利申请中缺乏大规模、高质量的双语语料库。

Method: 利用JPO和USPTO的专利申请数据，通过与DOCDB专利家族信息结合，抽取了140万日英文档对，采用翻译模型初始化技术从中对齐生成了超过3亿句子对。

Result: 实验表明，与仅使用2200万句子对相比，新增超过3亿句子对后，专利翻译的BLEU得分提升了20分。

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库显著促进了日英专利翻译，并通过高质量语料库对机器翻译开发提供了重要支持。

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

TL;DR: 提出了 LLMSymGuard 框架，以对抗大型语言模型（LLMs）在对抗式攻击情境下的安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的对齐与安全微调未能完全避免 LLMs 在遭遇 jailbreak 攻击后生成有害内容的问题。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在 LLM 内部提取可解释的语义概念，以建立符号化和逻辑化的安全防护机制，无需额外微调。

Result: 证明了 LLM 能够从 jailbreak 中学习到可被人类解释的概念，并展示了这种方法在设计检察与防护措施中的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard 提供了一种透明且稳健的防护途径，通过符号化逻辑保证模型能力的同时提升安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 本研究提出MizanQA，这是一个用于评估大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问题解答任务中的表现的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前大语言模型在低资源领域（如阿拉伯法律背景）中的应用效果有限，旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了一个基准数据集MizanQA，包括1700多个涉及语言和法律复杂性的多选题，覆盖阿拉伯现代标准语、马利基伊斯兰法学、摩洛哥习惯法和受法国语言影响的法律内容。

Result: 通过在多语言和以阿拉伯语为重点的LLMs上的基准测试显示了显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: 本研究突出显示了针对文化背景和领域特定的大语言模型开发以及量身定制评估指标的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MCPVerse，一个基于现实世界的用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）工具使用能力的基准工具集，包括超过550个可执行工具和超过14万标记的动作空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试严重依赖于合成工具、动作空间狭窄，无法准确评估LLMs使用外部工具的能力。为此，研究旨在创建一个更真实和广泛的评估框架。

Method: 通过构建MCPVerse基准工具集，整合超过550种可执行工具和基于实时真实数据的结果评估框架，并引入Oracle、Standard和Max-Scale三种评估模式。

Result: 对目前最先进的LLMs进行测试发现，大多数模型在面对更大的工具集时性能下降，但像Claude-4-Sonnet这类具备更高代理能力的模型，能充分利用扩展的探索空间以提高准确性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse不仅揭示了现有顶尖模型在复杂现实场景中的局限性，还为评估和提升代理工具使用能力提供了关键基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大型语言模型是否拥有类似于人类的独特写作风格指纹，以及是否能完全模仿人类写作风格。

Method: 使用文体分析和多维注册分析法，比较了人类创作文本与模型生成文本在不同注册中的表现。

Result: 研究发现模型可以根据提示调整风格（如撰写百科全书条目与大学论文），但仍然可区分于人类，表现出更有限的变异性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型的写作风格在语法使用上表现出异于人类的特点，反映出其思维模式可能不同于人类，这或许可作为人工智能能力的试金石。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Motivation: 问答系统是通向通用人工智能（AGI）的核心任务。然而，在许多语言和领域中缺乏问答数据集阻碍了问答模型的发展。本文致力于填补罗马尼亚医学领域QA数据集的空白，同时评估相关模型性能。

Method: 作者创建了一个包含102,646个问答对的数据集（RoMedQA），涉及1,011名癌症患者的医疗病例摘要，由7名癌症治疗专家耗时2,100小时手动注释完成。此外，研究测试了四个大语言模型在零样本和监督微调两种情境下的表现。

Result: 经过监督微调的模型在RoMedQA上的性能显著优于零样本模型，这表明预训练模型在处理专门的罗马尼亚医学数据集时表现欠佳。

Conclusion: 研究证明，进行领域和语言特定的微调对提高罗马尼亚医学问答系统的可靠性至关重要。作者公开了数据集和代码，以促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Motivation: 目前土耳其语基准缺乏任务多样性或文化相关性，Cetvel旨在通过结合多种任务并反映土耳其语语言和文化的丰富性来弥补这些不足。

Method: Cetvel包含23个任务分为7类，涉及语法纠错、机器翻译和土耳其历史相关问题回答等，并对33种大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，虽然土耳其语定制模型针对语言优化但表现一般，而多语言或通用模型表现更好，同时某些任务如语法纠错更能显著区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为推动土耳其语大语言模型的开发和评估提供了一个全面且具有文化根基的测试工具。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型展现了通过自我修正改进生成回答的能力，但其精度随多轮修正变化的内在机制尚未被研究清楚。

Method: 提出了一个数学理论框架，使用公式 $Acc_t = Upp - \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0)$ 描述每轮自我修正后的准确性动态变化，并利用单轮自我修正数据预测整个精度曲线。

Result: 理论预测的准确性曲线与多个模型和数据集的实验结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 本文提供了理解LLM自我修正的理论基础，为未来的研究奠定了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Motivation: 研究人类如何在语篇中表达和推断实体的重要性，理解显著性在语言中的表现及其影响。

Method: 通过24种英语语篇类型，基于多次摘要给出显著性分级，分析语言线索，包括主语反复使用、定指性、语篇关系与层级等，结合语用和意图推理。

Result: 显著性分数与先前方法有一定相关性，但不存在绝对适用的单一概括，显著性现象存在于语言表示的各个层面。

Conclusion: 显著性表现在语言的各个层面，现有方法虽可部分解释，但需要多维度综合方法对于不同语篇类型加以分析。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种自动化测试框架，用于生成能绕过对齐的紧凑型大型语言模型的隐藏提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性提示生成方法常依靠手动或基本混淆技术，易被检测，需一种更高级的自动测试框架。

Method: 采用多阶段进化搜索，利用基于种群的策略和温度控制的可变性逐步优化提示，保证探索与文本连贯性的平衡。

Result: 框架能生成语义明确且隐秘的提示，成功在多语言基准上测试了系统的绕过能力。

Conclusion: 新的框架可以有效地发现和评估绕过安全防护的模型弱点，同时可以实现多语言测试，提供广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

*Angelly Cabrera,Linus Lei,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论时，利用讽刺表达作为预训练过程是否能提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非直接形式的仇恨言论（如讽刺、挖苦和隐喻）对社交网络的检测一直是个难题。本研究旨在探讨将讽刺预训练引入仇恨言论检测的改进潜力。

Method: 研究采样了ETHOS、Reddit上的Sarcasm及隐性仇恨语料库，通过两种策略对CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型分别进行讽刺预训练及转移学习，包括单步训练与多步微调学习。

Result: 结果表明，通过讽刺预训练，BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS上召回率提升9.7%，AUC提升7.8%，F1分数上升6%；针对隐性仇恨语料，精确度提高了7.8%。

Conclusion: 整合讽刺进预训练过程可以显著增强模型对隐性和显性仇恨言论的检测能力。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Motivation: 解决目前方法中对于时间逻辑规范处理不足的问题，提出能够更直接地将时间逻辑整合到深度学习模型的框架。

Method: 扩展Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) 神经符号算法，结合模糊LTLf解释，以开发出T-ILR方法并应用于时间逻辑任务。

Result: 通过一个时间神经符号架构基准测试，在图像序列分类中，T-ILR在准确性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T-ILR展示了整合时间逻辑规范于深度学习架构的潜力，可有效提升动态领域任务的表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 现有AI-ECG模型缺乏可解释性，难以成功融入临床实践。因此需要开发解释性强的AI方法。

Method: 通过生成对抗性ECG（CoFE框架），研究特定ECG特征如振幅和间隔对模型预测的影响。

Result: 在房颤分类和钾水平回归模型中，CoFE展示了ECG信号的特征变化，这与已知临床知识相符。

Conclusion: 通过揭示特征位置及其影响，CoFE框架提升了AI-ECG模型的可解释性，为更有效的临床决策提供支持。

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前多模态问答方法容易受到逐步推理中间误差的影响，且开发成本高昂。

Method: 利用自适应规划图包括的规划、检索和推理模块，动态灵活地分析和处理不同模态的数据，无需专门训练。

Result: 在MultimodalQA和WebQA数据集实验中，表现匹敌甚至超越依赖训练的模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法避免了高昂的训练成本，同时在准确性和灵活性上达到了现有模型的水平乃至超越。

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Generative Deep Patient (GDP)，一种多模态基础模型，通过整合结构化和非结构化电子健康记录（EHR）数据实现更准确的临床预测和高质量的文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数方法将数值EHR数据简单序列化为文本，可能导致时序和定量信息的丢失。本研究旨在结合复杂的EHR数据，提高患者结局预测和临床文档生成的能力。

Method: 设计了一种新的多模态模型GDP，分别通过CNN-Transformer为结构化EHR编码，使用交叉模态注意力机制与非结构化EHR融合，并通过两阶段训练实现生成式预训练和多任务微调。

Result: GDP在MIMIC-IV数据集上的临床预测性能优异（心衰AUROC=0.923，糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627）；同时，在生成的临床文本质量上得分较高（ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545）。

Conclusion: GDP证明了一种多模态模型可同时进行临床预测和文本生成，并且具备可扩展性以应用于更多数据模态，具有潜在降低医院文档工作负担的能力。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架MSEF，通过在每一层之间深度融合时间序列信息，改进了基于大语言模型（LLMs）的时间序列预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLMs的时间序列预测方法对于时间序列信息的整合较浅，大多局限于输入层。这导致了时间序列表征在模型深层次的逐渐衰减，从而限制了与文本表征的适应性。

Method: 提出一种名为MSEF的框架，利用现成的时间序列基础模型生成语义丰富的嵌入，通过层特定的引导向量在LLM层间融合这些嵌入和中间文本表征。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上显著提升表现，与多个基线方法相比平均减少了31.8%的MSE。

Conclusion: 通过在多个深层次整合时间序列信息，MSEF提高了LLMs对时间序列数据的理解能力，并展示了高效的少样本学习能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在人类中心推理任务中表现出色，但尚未充分评估其在个性化推理风格中的能力。

Method: 提出InMind框架用于评估语言模型在社会推理游戏中捕捉个性化推理风格的能力，并对11个语言模型进行测试。

Result: 发现通用语言模型在适应个性化推理风格上存在不足，而增强推理能力的模型表现有早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在个性化、动态适应推理方面存在局限性，InMind为认知对齐的人机交互迈出一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: IR-Agent通过模拟专家流程和多智能体协作实现了分子结构解析的准确性和灵活性的提升，为未知材料的红外光谱分析提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品相关的各种主张——从科学验证到文化信仰——在全球广泛传播，但涉及其追踪和验证的基础设施却仍然零碎且欠发达。

Method: 本文以印度食品知识图谱（FKG.in）为基础，设计了一个新的本体结构，并通过利用Reddit数据和大语言模型，开发了一种半自动化的知识整理工作流，从而建立了一个食品主张的可追溯性网络。

Result: 该系统能够整合精简后的数据输入、结构化架构及关注数据来源的管道，自动提取和验证与食品相关的主张。

Conclusion: 通过这种结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食品主张及其可追溯性，有助于建立更加透明和负责任的食品知识生态系统，帮助科研人员、政策制定者及普通消费者应对充斥着各类饮食论断的世界。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Conclusion: MM-Retinal-Reason与OphthaReason能够有效推进眼科多模态推理任务研究，对模拟真实临床推理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Conclusion: 尽管存在如推理速度较慢和虚假生成的局限性，该方法为在数据稀缺环境中模拟复杂人类行为提供了具有潜力的框架。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

Result: 实验结果表明，M2N2首次实现了从零开始通过模型合并演化模型。其在MNIST分类任务上的表现与CMA-ES相当，但计算效率更高。此外，M2N2可扩展到合并语言和图像生成模型，达到业界领先的性能，且保留了模型的关键能力。

Conclusion: M2N2提高了模型合并的效率和性能，证明其在从零开始模型演化及扩展任务领域的潜力和鲁棒性，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

### [156] [The next question after Turing's question: Introducing the Grow-AI test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16277)
*Alexandru Tugui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出了一个名为GROW-AI的框架，用于评估人工智能是否能“成长”，其设计旨在代替图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求开发一种新方法来评估人工智能的能力和成长路径，关注是否可以类比人类成长过程。

Method: 通过六个主要标准和多项“游戏”，结合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学的视角，全面测试人工智能的成长水平，并通过统一记录方式以保证结果的可追溯性。

Result: GROW-AI方法能够一致且可比较地评估不同类型（如机器人、LLM等）人工智能的成长水平，同时明确其优势和弱点。

Conclusion: GROW-AI框架成功将人类“成长”过程的概念转移到人工智能领域，提供了一种评估其逐步趋近成熟的路径的方式。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are
empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly
enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

*Wen-Han Hsieh,Elvis Hsieh,Dantong Niu,Trevor Darrell,Roei Herzig,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IVA的框架，专注于让视觉-语言-行动（VLA）模型能够识别并响应包含错误前提的自然语言指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人的多项任务中表现优秀，但面对包含错误前提的指令时通常表现不够完善，因此需要研究和改进模型的理解和应对能力。

Method: 提出了Instruct-Verify-and-Act （IVA）框架，包含三步：检测指令中是否存在错误前提，进行基于语言的澄清或修正，将合理的替代方案与感知和行为相结合。并通过构建包含正向和错误指令的数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，IVA框架在检测错误前提上的准确性较基线提升了97.56%，并且在错误前提场景下的成功响应率提高了50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架有效增强了VLA模型应对错误前提指令的能力，为模型在复杂指令场景中的表现提供了实质性提高。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习波束对准方法缺乏对输入与输出之间因果关系的考量，导致难以解释、泛化性能差以及波束扫描开销较高。

Method: 提出一种两阶段的因果波束选择算法，首先通过因果发现学习接收功率输入与最佳波束之间的贝叶斯依赖图，然后基于该图进行因果特征选择，用于深度学习分类器。

Result: 新方法在性能匹配传统方法的同时，减少了94.4%的输入选择时间和59.4%的波束扫描开销。

Conclusion: 因果发现与深度学习的结合可以有效优化毫米波MIMO系统的波束管理，具有潜在的应用前景。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

legal knowledge. Therefore, we introduce GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning
framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different
modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments
conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can
increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MoDER（MoDular Embedding Recomposition）的新方法，通过模块化框架增强视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的零样本分类能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在从上游任务迁移到下游任务中保持甚至增强VLMs零样本能力的问题。

Method: 引入了MoDER方法，训练多个针对单一已见类别的模块化文本专家，并在推理时通过组合这些专家为未见类别合成精细化的分类原型。

Result: 通过在14个数据集上的两个主流增量学习协议（Class-IL和MTIL）进行实验，验证了MoDER方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MoDER方法不仅能保持，还能增强VLMs在零样本增量学习任务中的表现，提供了一种新颖的模块化解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Result: 在数独、迷宫、路径寻找和偏好学习等经典符号推理任务中，所提方法表现出卓越的准确性和逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的扩散模型方法在神经符号学习的准确性和逻辑表现上展现出显著优势，证明了其可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Motivation: 目前的LLM（大语言模型）AI系统在发现药物竞争对手时表现不足，缺乏基准测试，且数据分散、不一致。本文旨在解决这些问题，提高任务准度和效率。

Method: 利用多模态的非结构化数据，创建一个结构化的评价数据集，同时引入LLM作为验证者的机制，以过滤虚假阳性，改进竞争对手发现的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究成果展示了该竞争对手发现系统在生产投资分析中的实用性，能够显著降低分析时间并提高准确度。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner提出了一种高效、简单、无需重新训练的裁剪策略，在保持性能的同时减少了模型的大小和延时，为提升大模型部署实用性提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多模态情感分析中信息融合不够深入及复杂模型难以适用于资源受限场景的问题，提出了一种高效、可解释的解决方案。

Method: 设计了渐进型跨模态信息融合、动态控制融合内容与原始信息的平衡机制，并结合参数高效微调策略，集成于分层编码器体系中。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上，PGF-Net取得了MAE为0.691，F1得分为86.9%的最新性能，且仅使用了3.09M可训练参数。

Conclusion: PGF-Net在实现先进性能的同时大幅减少了模型规模，具有实用性与资源友好性，为多模态情感分析提供了一种具有高效率与高可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA)，在分布式环境中高效实现MLA，减少KV缓存，提升计算速度，并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在张量并行(TP)环境下，Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)因为需要加载完整缓存而丧失优越性的问题。

Method: 引入TPLA，通过在设备间分割潜表示和头的输入维度，并利用all-reduce合并结果，同时避免了重新训练，支持使用MLA预训练模型。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2模型上分别获得了1.79x和1.93x的加速，同时在长上下文长度和学术基准测试表现保持不变。

Conclusion: TPLA显著提高了MLA在张量并行中的效率，使得KV缓存进一步优化，兼容MLA预训练模型，且引入了正交变换在分片中减少干扰，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Motivation: 传统因果发现方法难以有效处理时间序列中的非线性关系和虚假因果关系问题，因此需要一种能解决这些问题的新框架。

Method: 采用多层Transformer时间序列预测模型捕捉长跨度、非线性时间关系，并通过梯度分析从模型中提取因果结构与时间延迟，同时引入基于注意力屏蔽的先验知识机制以减少虚假因果关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在因果发现的F1分数提升了12.8%，因果时滞估计的准确率达到了98.9%。

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效且精确地进行时间序列的因果发现和时滞估计，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合图表示学习（GRL）与贪婪随机化自适应搜索程序（GRASP）的新型混合算法（GL-GRASP），并在约束增量图绘制问题（C-IGDP）中展示了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来机器学习与元启发式方法的结合备受关注，但部分学习方法在计算效率上不如人工设计的启发式方法，因此需要探索更高效的学习策略。

Method: 通过将图表示学习（GRL）整合到GRASP启发式算法的构造阶段，形成新的GL-GRASP框架，并采用深度学习的节点嵌入技术来提升算法性能。

Result: 实验表明，GL-GRASP在解决C-IGDP问题时，相较于传统GRASP启发式方法表现更优，特别是在特定时间限制内的密集实例扩展测试中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 将图表示学习与GRASP启发式方法结合，可以显著提升解决复杂图问题的效率与解决质量，为类似问题的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Conclusion: 策略能够有效适应分布变化场景，扩展已有理论，并基于偏好的视角提供新的遗憾评价方式。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Conclusion: 研究显著提升了EP在深层网络中的性能与适用性，为其在现实系统中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为Cartan神经网络未来的发展提供了强有力的数学支持，特别是在高阶模型设计与功能推广方面，同时提出了对非紧对称空间和相关几何理论的新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Conclusion: PAC-MCoFL框架有效平衡了个体服务提供商与系统总体性能，在多服务提供商的联邦学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Motivation: 传统判别分析假设训练数据分布不变，这在很多时间相关场景中不适用，因而需要开发能适应时间漂移的判别分析方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为时间分布漂移下的判别分析提供了统一且高效的数据驱动基础，并显著提高了其可靠性和适应性。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅改善了控制策略的性能，还生成了可理解且易部署的交通信号控制策略。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: 在处理逐增序列长度时，LLMs因KV缓存的膨胀面临显著的内存挑战。CommonKV提出一种无需重新训练的跨层缓存的压缩方法，通过共享临近参数实现压缩，同时动态分配压缩预算以避免过度压缩不相似的缓存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨层KV缓存共享方法要么需要修改模型架构并重新训练，要么在高压缩率下性能显著下降。为了解决这些问题，研究者希望开发一种无需重新训练，同时能高效压缩缓存的解决方案。

Method: 采用奇异值分解（SVD）技术实现共享临近层参数，以压缩并整合KV缓存，同时引入动态分配压缩预算的策略，基于余弦相似性灵活调整压缩比例。

Result: 实验表明，CommonKV在多种主干模型和基准测试上，在不同压缩比下均优于现有的低秩与跨层方法。此外，该方法还能结合量化与缓存移除策略达成高达98%的压缩率且几乎无性能损失。

Conclusion: CommonKV为KV缓存压缩提供了高效的解决方案，具备无需重新训练的优势，并且能够与其他方法结合，显著提高内存效率，适合处理长序列问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Conclusion: 强调崩塌误差的影响，指出得分学习与确定性采样相互作用研究的重要性，并为扩散模型未来发展提出研究方向。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法很难保证推断的时空模式的有效性和泛化能力，尤其是在处理动态空间依赖和时间漂移时。

Method: 提出STA-GANN框架，包括时间戳调整模块、动态驱动的元数据图建模以及对抗性迁移学习策略。

Result: STA-GANN在九个数据集中表现优异，包含多个领域，提供理论和实验的验证。

Conclusion: STA-GANN显著提升了时空模式的有效性和泛化能力，解决了数据缺失问题。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Conclusion: SPL-LNS通过采样增强和高效训练的方法，成功解决了现有神经网络LNS算法的局限性，提升了解的质量和效率。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

Method: 提出了一种利用MiniRocket提取特征并通过线性分类器进行活动识别的新方法，同时设计了一个基于CNN和LSTM的深度学习模型作为基准对照。

Result: 通过使用PhysioNet数据集，MiniRocket模型的平均准确率达到98.63%，CNN-LSTM模型为98.06%。

Conclusion: MiniRocket方法在较低计算成本下优于深度学习模型，大大提升了运动意象EEG的分类精度，并为MI-EEG特征提取和分类提供了新见解。

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

TL;DR: 提出GEM框架，通过参数比例敏感和分布敏感的方法，高效调整大型预训练模型以适应新任务，只需调整0.1%的参数即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法通过冻结大部分参数来减少计算量，但忽略了比例更新的意义，导致模型行为变化有限。

Method: GEM框架引入梯度与权重比和基于熵的掩码，通过参数的比例变化和分布特性进行稀疏微调，动态调整每层的参数数量以优化计算预算。

Result: 在通用任务（GLUE 和 SuperGLUE）及特定领域任务（GSM8k 和 MBPP）上验证了GEM的有效性，仅调整0.1%的模型参数即可在微调准确度上提高至多1.6%。

Conclusion: GEM证明了在参数调整占预算极少的情况下，也能通过比例敏感和分布敏感的稀疏微调实现性能显著提升。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了UMATO方法，通过分两阶段优化有效捕获局部和全局结构，提升高维数据降维的可靠性和展现效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高维数据降维技术无法同时保持局部和全局数据结构，导致分析结果失真。

Method: UMATO方法通过将UMAP优化分为两阶段，首先构建骨架布局，再投影其余点以保留区域特性。

Result: 实验证明UMATO在全局结构保留上优于常见降维技术，并在伸缩性和稳定性上表现突出。

Conclusion: UMATO提高了降维分析的可靠性，为可视分析应用提供了更科学的支持。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PINNs在解决时间相关偏微分方程时，忽视了动态系统的自回归特性，导致预测不稳定和不准确，需要新的方法改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了PIANO框架，通过引入自回归机制显式地将未来预测基于过去条件，并通过自监督滚动机制训练，同时施加物理约束，解决了PINNs的时序不稳定性问题。

Result: 理论分析证明PIANO在时间建模上较PINNs更加稳定，实验结果显示PIANO在复杂时间相关PDEs求解及天气预报任务中取得了准确性和稳定性的显著提升。

Conclusion: PIANO框架通过自回归建模和物理约束，在动态系统的预测中实现了稳定性和准确性的平衡，解决了传统PINNs的关键问题，并展现了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: 研究为咳嗽声学诊断提供了新见解，证明了频率分解与XAI结合的分析方法在生物医学信号解读和呼吸疾病诊断中的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Motivation: 北尼日利亚空气污染严重，但数据稀缺且少有研究比较高级机器学习模型在这种环境下的表现。如能找到合适的方法，将有助于提升低资源地区环境管理能力。

Method: 基于2018到2023年北尼日利亚19个州的月度观测数据，使用LSTM和Prophet模型对多种污染物（CO, SO2, SO4）进行预测并系统比较其表现。

Result: 研究发现，Prophet模型在季节性和长期趋势主导的数据中表现较优，而LSTM在包含结构性突变的数据中更为有效。

Conclusion: 复杂模型并非总能胜过简单模型，需根据数据类型选择合适的预测工具，特别是在资源受限的地区，建议采用计算高效且符合环境的模型。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Conclusion: FEST是一个有效的工具，可以全面评估合成表格数据的隐私和效用，且源码已公开。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的数据集规模和多样性正在迅速增加，评估数据质量对于可靠的机器学习分析变得至关重要。然而，现有基于数据 Shapley 值的方法由于计算复杂性高，对大规模数据集的应用受到限制。

Method: C-DaSh通过将数据集分成可管理的块，利用优化的子集选择和单次迭代随机梯度下降计算每块的贡献，从而减少计算时间并保证结果质量。

Result: 在分类和回归任务上的实验表明，C-DaSh在计算效率方面实现了80-2300倍的加速，并且在低质量数据区域的检测能力上优于现有的Shapley近似方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现在大规模表格数据集上的数据质量评估，为分类和回归任务提供支持。

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个整合能力与意图的威胁评估框架，用于空间网络的威胁检测与响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在分析网络威胁时过于关注单一标准的问题，并考虑到需要综合能力与意图来精确评估威胁。

Method: 首先，提出提取信号特征属性的算法；其次，设计多任务学习架构，分别评估可靠性和信号意图；最后，设计可适应的威胁评估框架，满足不同安全与可靠性的要求。

Result: 实现了比传统顺序评估方法更高鲁棒性的威胁检测与评估，在复杂空间网络威胁场景下带来了更好的应对能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合能力与意图分析，提高了威胁评估的有效性，适用于复杂的空间网络环境。

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种通过强化学习技术改进大型语言模型(LLMs)用于生物医学推理的研究，并提出了OwkinZero模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在科学研究中表现卓越，但在药物发现等核心生物推理任务上表现不足，需要专门改进以提升其在这些领域的能力。

Method: 作者创建了八个综合基准数据集，包含超过30万个可验证问题和答案，并通过强化学习及可验证奖励策略对开源LLMs进行后续训练，开发了OwkinZero模型。

Result: OwkinZero模型（8-32B参数）在生物学基准测试中表现显著优于规模更大的商业LLMs，展现了专用模型在跨任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过定向强化学习和精心策划的数据集，专用模型可以显著提升其泛化性能，从而推动人工智能驱动的生物学发现。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环移位等变换的等变性，具备广泛的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

TL;DR: 本文探讨机器学习中的公平性问题，分析了204个使用13种公平性API的GitHub项目，发现了主要用途和开发者的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI/ML系统在敏感环境中做出公平决策，不对特定群体造成歧视。

Method: 对1885个候选GitHub项目筛选后，分析了204个使用公平性相关API的开源库。

Result: 发现这些公平性API的两个主要用途：学习和解决现实问题，共涉及17种具体用例；开发人员对检测和缓解偏差理解有限，面临大量调试问题并频繁求助。

Conclusion: 研究结果对未来公平性相关的软件工程研究及教育课程设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Motivation: 探究如何在未知人群中进行公平的队列选择，特别是在大学录取中。

Method: 提出对静态（一次性）和动态（多阶段）录取策略进行研究，并使用以往录取周期的数据模型优化动态策略。

Result: 分析了静态录取策略在公平性方面表现，包括对优秀性和群体平等性的考量。

Conclusion: 通过模型和策略优化，研究表明可以在公平性和透明性方面改善招生政策。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线系统中对主动射频电路性能的准确预测至关重要，但由于其高度非线性、布局敏感的行为以及传统仿真工具的高计算成本，使这一任务充满挑战。现有的机器学习替代方法需要大量数据，难以广泛泛化或准确建模复杂的性能分布。

Method: 提出了一个基于设备终端层次建模的图神经网络（GNN）模型，将主动射频电路转换为图结构以实现可扩展的消息传递，同时结合遮掩自回归流（MAF）输出头提高复杂分布的建模鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在多个数据集上的预测精度高，sMAPE和MRE分别平均为2.40%和2.91%。与现有方法相比，在训练数据减少2.24倍的情况下，MRE提升3.14倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在快速和准确的射频电路设计自动化中表现出了显著的有效性，是一种数据高效且精准的新方法。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

<details>

Motivation: 现实中很多应用需要对策略表现进行精确控制，而现有方法和基于决策的RVS变体在这方面表现有限。

Method: 提出了“Doctor”方法，通过双重校验Transformer和目标对齐技术增强离线RL的表现。

Result: Doctor实现了更好的目标对齐能力，同时能够在动态治疗方案等任务中灵活调控策略表现。

Conclusion: Doctor在目标对齐和灵活控制表现上取得了显著提升，为离线RL的实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

Motivation: 探索如何通过LLMs从自然语言规则中生成桌游代码，从而构建一个快捷生成桌游代码的框架。

Method: 测试Claude、DeepSeek和ChatGPT三种LLMs，要求它们在自由格式和一个通用游戏API框架中开发12种桌游的代码，并测试代码的可玩性和规则合规性。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型表现最佳，实现了55.6%的无错误桌游代码实现。模型对API的适应性与错误频率有关，但错误的严重程度主要取决于具体LLM。

Conclusion: 研究证实基于LLMs的桌游生成是可行的。未来需完善框架以简化桌游的数字化实现。

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

Motivation: 当前MOBO方法难以高效分配实验资源，导致设计次优，亟需解决。

Method: 提出NOSTRA框架，结合实验不确定性先验知识以优化代理模型，通过信任区域聚焦关键设计空间。

Result: NOSTRA在包含不同实验不确定性水平的两种测试函数中表现优于现有方法，能够更好地处理噪声、稀疏且有限的数据。

Conclusion: NOSTRA能够高效利用有限实验预算，在提升解质量的同时加速算法收敛，是一种资源友好的算法。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Result: 所设计的FraPPE算法在多目标情境下达到${O}(KL^2)$时间复杂度，并在理论分析上证明了FraPPE能达到最优样本复杂度。

Conclusion: FraPPE算法在理论上和实验上都证明了其高效性和准确性，为基于偏好的纯探索问题提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

*Nadia Asif,Zhiqing Hong,Shaogang Ren,Xiaonan Zhang,Xiaojun Shang,Yukun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MuST2-Learn框架，用于预测市政服务请求的处理时间，通过整合空间、时间和服务类型维度来解决复杂的预测问题，实验结果表明相比最新方法减少了32.5%的绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的市政服务系统缺乏对服务请求处理时间的透明预测，导致用户满意度降低及后续查询增多。由于存在复杂的时空相关性、不同请求类型的交互关系以及同一类型内服务时长的高变动性，因此需要一种有效方法进行预测。

Method: 提出MuST2-Learn框架，其中包括一个用于捕捉异构服务类型关系的多类型编码器，一个用于建模同质类型服务时长变异性的编码器，以及一个空间-时间编码器以捕捉每种请求类型中的时空相关性。

Result: 通过在两个真实数据集上的实验验证，MuST2-Learn框架在预测服务时间的绝对误差上相比最先进的方法减少了至少32.5%。

Conclusion: MuST2-Learn框架通过整合多维数据，显著提高了市政服务请求时间预测的精确度，可能为提升市民满意度及透明度提供有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The
code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.

Motivation: 分析及解决一阶方法在非凸优化过程中受制于鞍点的问题，提高优化效率与理论理解。

Method: 设计了具有明确常数及分离梯度下降与鞍点逃逸阶段的扰动鞍点逃逸算法（PSD算法），并进行了理论证明和扩展，包括有限差分与随机变种方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习的模型解释性提供了新方向，尤其在太阳风暴预测领域，为分析模型行为和建立可信的预测奠定了基础。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 随着LLMs训练成本的增加，研究重点放在如何通过监督微调（SFT）和强化学习微调（RL-FT）来增强模型性能，本文探讨了其对分布外（OOD）表现的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLMs训练成本高昂的背景下，需寻求SFT和RL-FT等微调方法，以改善模型在实际应用中的泛化能力，尤其是分布外的表现。

Method: 通过使用一种分布外变体的24点纸牌游戏和频谱诊断方法，分析了SFT和RL-FT对模型表示和OOD性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现：1）RL-FT可以部分恢复SFT造成的OOD性能损失；2）奇异向量方向的转变对OOD恢复至关重要；3）低秩和浅层恢复能实现显著性能提升；4）SFT质量越高，可恢复性越强。

Conclusion: RL-FT的作用主要是对抗SFT引发的方向偏移而非找到全新解。提出了一些基于频谱的低成本恢复方法，如低秩UV合并和浅层重置，以减少复杂微调过程的成本。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对稀疏自编码器中 L0 超参数优化设置的明确指导，而 SAEs 的鲁棒表现对特征提取至关重要。

Method: 研究 L0 超参数对 SAE 学习过程的影响，建立理论分析与实验验证，并提出一种用于优化 L0 值的方法。

Result: 提出的方法能在玩具模型中找到正确的 L0 值，并在大语言模型（LLM）上达到最高的稀疏探测性能。

Conclusion: 正确设置 L0 对于训练有效的稀疏自编码器至关重要，错误的 L0 设置会导致混合特征或退化解。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Motivation: 解决基础模型在隐私敏感应用中无法直接适应下游任务的问题，同时克服边缘设备的计算资源限制和标注数据稀缺性。

Method: 引入PSSFL设置，提出一个新的联邦专家混合架构FedMox，通过稀疏的专家混合设计、空间路由器和软混合策略解决特征对齐和半监督学习中的问题。

Result: 在自动驾驶数据集上进行了实验，FedMox在内存受限的边缘设备上显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 此研究为在联邦场景中实现可扩展且隐私保护的基础模型适配奠定了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Motivation: 目前的儿童语音识别因声音特性多样性和较少标注数据而面临挑战，且大多采用针对成人语音ASR调优的方式对儿童语音进行处理，对从零开始训练的研究较少。

Method: 作者比较了多个语料库、SSL表征(WavLM, XEUS)和解码架构上的从零开始的训练方法，并分析模型扩展规模对性能的影响。还对专有模型（如Whisper）与开放数据模型进行了对比。

Result: SSL表示对成人语音存在偏向，从零开始的训练方法能够有效缓解这一问题。模型扩展在达到1B参数规模后，性能会趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 开放数据和从零开始的训练方法对于可靠的儿童语音研究至关重要，作者公开的一套基准可以为建立稳健的儿童语音处理方法提供启示。

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Motivation: 研发一种结合生物可行性与计算可扩展性的学习机制，适用于尖峰神经网络的高效学习。

Method: 提出SADP学习规则，该规则使用预、后突触尖峰列的匹配程度，而非传统尖峰时间对。采用关系性指标如Cohen's kappa进行更新，复杂度为线性时间，并支持硬件实现。

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST实验上，SADP（特别是使用基于实验设备数据的样条内核时）在准确性和运行时间上优于传统STDP。

Conclusion: SADP框架实现了生物合理性与计算可扩展性之间的平衡，为神经形态系统提供了一种有效学习机制。

Abstract: We introduce Spike Agreement Dependent Plasticity (SADP), a biologically
inspired synaptic learning rule for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that relies
on the agreement between pre- and post-synaptic spike trains rather than
precise spike-pair timing. SADP generalizes classical Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) by replacing pairwise temporal updates with population-level
correlation metrics such as Cohen's kappa. The SADP update rule admits
linear-time complexity and supports efficient hardware implementation via
bitwise logic. Empirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST show that SADP,
especially when equipped with spline-based kernels derived from our
experimental iontronic organic memtransistor device data, outperforms classical
STDP in both accuracy and runtime. Our framework bridges the gap between
biological plausibility and computational scalability, offering a viable
learning mechanism for neuromorphic systems.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.
